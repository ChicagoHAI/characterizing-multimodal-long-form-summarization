Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, operating earnings, that is not based on GAAP. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for definitions of this and other measures.\nOverview\nThe Company is a provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management and is organized into three segments: Retail; Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; and Corporate Benefit Funding. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. See also - Other Key Information\u201d for information on MetLife, Inc.'s announcement of its plan to pursue the Separation. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nOther Key Information\nOn February 28, 2016, MetLife, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement with MassMutual pursuant to which MassMutual will acquire MetLife's U.S. Retail advisor force, the MetLife Premier Client Group, together with its affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., and certain related assets. As part of the transaction, MetLife, Inc. and MassMutual have also agreed to enter into a product development agreement under which MetLife's U.S. Retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by MassMutual. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval.\nOn January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. MetLife is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the SEC filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. MetLife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not be a part of the Separation. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company would no longer write new retail life and annuity business post-Separation.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented certain segment reporting changes related to the measurement of segment operating earnings, which included revising the Company's capital allocation methodology. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated operating earnings or net income. Consequently, prior period results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were impacted as follows:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retail's operating earnings increased by $145 million, net of $49 million of income tax benefit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits' operating earnings decreased by $19 million, net of $13 million of income tax benefit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate Benefit Funding's operating earnings decreased by $60 million, net of $41 million of income tax benefit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate & Other's operating earnings decreased by $66 million, net of $103 million of income tax expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>investment impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td> measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are deferred as DAC. In addition to commissions and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $50 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.25%.\nWe also periodically review other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to AFS securities is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee Notes 1 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales declined from 2014 levels; however, sales experience was positive across various products within our businesses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The introduction of new variable annuity products in late 2014 and early 2015, as well as pricing actions and our continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs, all contributed to higher sales in our Retail segment. For our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, 2015 sales were slightly lower, as improved sales of voluntary products were more than offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition. Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S&P 500 companies, we experienced an increase in sales of pension risk transfers. However, more competitive pricing in the market drove a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>2,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>11,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>1,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>38,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>25,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>2,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>5,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>34,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax\n</td> <td>4,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax\n</td> <td>2,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>2,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax, decreased $852 million ($1.1 billion, net of income tax) from 2014 primarily driven by a $557 million one-time tax charge and a $362 million ($235 million, net of income tax) one-time charge for interest on uncertain tax positions that were recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties related to the U.S. tax treatment of taxes paid by a wholly-owned United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. We also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. Certain of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings.\nCertain direct or assumed variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use reinsurance and derivatives to hedge the market and other risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ceded reinsurance of direct variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits generally contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivatives, are referred to as VA program derivatives\u201d in the following table. All other embedded derivatives and all freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives\u201d in the following table. The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange rate\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives-direct and assumed guarantees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risks\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other risks\n</td> <td>(280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(169\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives-ceded reinsurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market and other risks\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivatives hedging direct and assumed embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>(108\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $373 million ($242 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to a change in the value of underlying assets and the recapture of a certain reinsurance agreement from an affiliate which favorably impacted non-VA embedded derivatives related to affiliated ceded reinsurance written on a coinsurance with funds withheld basis. This favorable change was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of mid- to long-term interest rates decreasing less in 2015 than in 2014, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaptions and interest rate swaps. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $529 million ($344 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $549 million ($357 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $20 million ($13 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.\nThe foregoing unfavorable change of $549 million ($357 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in market factors, as well as by the recapture of certain variable annuities previously reinsured to an affiliate.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term interest rates decreased less in 2015 than in 2014, contributing to a favorable change in our direct and assumed embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our ceded reinsurance assets, embedded derivatives and freestanding derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased by 3% in 2015 and 31% in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Key equity index levels decreased in 2015 and increased in 2014, contributing to an unfavorable change in our direct and assumed embedded derivatives and a favorable change in our ceded reinsurance assets and freestanding derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index decreased by 1% in 2015 and increased by 11% in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $15 million ($10 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to a favorable change of $7 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and a favorable change of $8 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives of $5 million ($3 million, net of income tax) was due to a favorable change of $10 million, before income tax, as a result of the impact of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by an unfavorable change of $5 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the direct and assumed variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk-adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk-adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. The opposite impact occurs with respect to the nonperformance risk adjustment on the ceded variable annuity guarantees when the reinsurer's credit spread increases in isolation. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.\nGenerally, a higher portion of the ceded reinsurance for GMIBs is accounted for as an embedded derivative as compared to the direct guarantees since the settlement provisions of the reinsurance agreements generally meet the accounting criteria of net settlement.\u201d This mismatch in accounting can lead to significant volatility in earnings, even though the risks inherent in these direct guarantees are fully covered by the ceded reinsurance.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $116 million ($75 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects higher net gains on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures. This favorable change was partially offset by higher impairments and net losses on sales and disposals of fixed maturity and equity securities.\nActuarial Assumption Review. Results for 2015 include a $163 million ($106 million, net of income tax), net of reinsurance, charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and DAC, of which a $2 million loss ($1 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $163 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves and $103 million ($67 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC.\nThe foregoing $2 million loss ($4 million direct and assumed, $6 million ceded) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual assumption review was included within the market and other risks caption in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions, and operational updates were made as well. The most significant impacts were in the Retail Life and Annuity blocks of business and are summarized as follows:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in economic assumptions resulted in reserve increases, net of reinsurance, and unfavorable DAC for a net loss of $34 million ($22 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes to policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions resulted in reserve increases, net of reinsurance, partially offset by favorable DAC for a net loss of $13 million ($9 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The remaining updates resulted in reserve increases, net of reinsurance, and unfavorable DAC for a net loss of $116 million ($75 million, net of income tax).

Of the $172 million benefit, $130 million ($85 million, net of income tax) was associated with DAC and $42 million ($27 million, net of income tax) was related to reserves.\nTaxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion, or 39% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with $1.5 billion, or 28% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company's 2015 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, the 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income and tax credits for low income housing.\nOperating Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use operating earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of operating earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax. Operating earnings decreased $1.1 billion, net of income tax, to $2.4 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.5 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nReconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, to operating earnings\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the decrease in operating earnings were: (i) a tax charge and a related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions in 2015, (ii) lower investment yields, (iii) an adjustment to better align the allocation of acquisition expenses with affiliates' sales revenue that decreased 2014 expenses, (iv) an unfavorable impact from our annual review of actuarial assumptions and (v) the prior period favorable reserve adjustment related to disability premium waivers in our life business, partially offset by (vi) higher net investment income from portfolio growth. Our financial results include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses.\nBusiness Growth. We benefited from higher sales and business growth across many of our products. An increase in our investment portfolio from deposits and funding agreement issuances in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and growth in premiums in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment generated higher net investment income. This was partially offset by the related increase in interest credited expense. Higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs drove lower operating earnings. Operating earnings also decreased in 2015 as a result of the disposition of our former broker-dealer subsidiary, NES, in the fourth quarter of 2014. In our Retail segment, negative net flows from the direct deferred variable annuity business decreased average separate account balances and, consequently, lower asset-based fee income. However, this was offset by higher asset-based fee income in our deferred annuities business as a result of the recapture of a ceded variable annuity reinsurance agreement from an affiliate. The changes in business growth discussed above resulted in a $15 million increase in operating earnings.\nMarket Factors. Investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as by lower returns on other limited partnership interests and our securities lending program. These decreases were partially offset by higher income on currency derivatives and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. Many of our funding agreement and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to external indices and, as a result, we set lower interest credited rates on new business, as well as on existing business with terms that can fluctuate. In our Retail segment, an increase in asset-based fee income resulted in an increase in operating earnings. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $298 million decrease in operating earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable mortality experience in our Retail and Corporate Benefit Funding segments, as well as less favorable morbidity experience in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment were almost entirely offset by favorable mortality experience in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, which resulted in a slight decrease in operating earnings. On an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. These annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $73 million and were primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in our Retail segment. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a net decrease of $52 million in operating earnings. The 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, all in our retail life business.\nExpenses. In 2015, other expenses include the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. In addition, an adjustment that decreased 2014 expenses by $140 million to better align the allocation of acquisition expenses with affiliates' sales revenue resulted in a decrease in operating earnings in 2015. These were partially offset by a $182 million decrease in expenses, which was primarily the result of a $117 million accrual in 2014 to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos and lower costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects.\nTaxes. The Company's 2015 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, partially offset by tax benefits of $5 million as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the higher utilization of tax preferenced investments. In addition, the Company's 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income and tax credits for low income housing.\nSegment Results and Corporate & Other\nRetail\nBusiness Overview. Life sales increased 17% driven by increases in our term life products (due to pricing actions), universal life products (due to new products introduced in 2014 and 2015) and whole life products (due to a continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs). Retail annuity sales increased 10% as a result of new variable annuity products introduced in late 2014 and early 2015. A significant portion of our operating earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by sales, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Separate account balances have declined due to market performance along with the impact of negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded sales.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>5,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>11,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>6,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>9,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. In our direct deferred variable annuity business, negative net flows decreased average separate account balances and, consequently, lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower interest credited expense. In our deferred annuities business, asset-based fee income increased as a result of the recapture of a ceded variable annuity reinsurance agreement from an affiliate, partially offset by higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs. In our life businesses, higher interest credited expense decreased operating earnings, but was offset by an increase in income from a larger invested asset base due to a higher amount of allocated equity as compared to 2014. Operating earnings decreased in 2015 as a result of the disposition of our former broker-dealer subsidiary, NES, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The items discussed above resulted in a $41 million decrease in operating earnings.\nMarket Factors. A $38 million decrease in operating earnings was attributable to market factors, including equity markets and interest rates. While separate account fund returns were down slightly on a full year basis, the positive returns in the first half of the year drove an increase in our average separate account balances which resulted in an increase in asset-based fee income. Lower returns on other limited partnership interests and on interest rate derivatives also decreased operating earnings. The sustained low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in net investment income on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. This reduction in current period income from lower yields was partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable mortality experience in our life business resulted in a $28 million decrease in operating earnings. Favorable morbidity experience in our individual disability income business resulted in a $5 million increase in operating earnings. On an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and DAC. These annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $73 million and were primarily related to unfavorable DAC unlockings in the life businesses. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a $48 million net decrease in operating earnings. The 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, all in our life business.\nExpenses and Taxes. An adjustment that decreased 2014 expenses by $140 million to better align the allocation of acquisition expenses with affiliates' sales revenue resulted in a decrease in operating earnings in 2015. In addition, an increase in expenses, mainly due to higher employee-related costs, resulted in a $26 million decrease in operating earnings. In 2015, we realized lower tax benefits of $8 million primarily related to the separate account dividends received deduction.\nGroup, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits\nBusiness Overview. Premiums increased for most of our businesses as a result of gradual growth in the U.S. economy, a decrease in the U.S. unemployment rate and low inflation. Our term life, dental, disability and voluntary benefits businesses generated premium growth due to sales and rate actions. In addition, we had strong persistency levels. The dental business also benefited from pricing actions on existing business. Our 2015 sales were slightly lower, as improved sales of voluntary products were more than offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>17,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>13,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>16,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>722\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. A $75 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. Growth in premiums, as well as increases in allocated equity, resulted in higher average invested assets, improving operating earnings. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, primarily in our long-term care business, interest credited on long-duration contracts and policyholder account balances increased. An increase in the annual assessment of the PPACA fee increased other expenses in 2015; however, the impact of the assessment was significantly offset by a related increase in premiums from our dental business. The remaining increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, partially offset by lower post-retirement benefit costs, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues.\nMarket Factors. The sustained low interest rate environment drove lower investment yields on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. In addition, yields were negatively impacted by a reduction in the size of our securities lending program, as well as lower returns on other limited partnership interests. This was partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments and currency derivatives. Unlike in the Retail and Corporate Benefit Funding segments, in the Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, a change in investment yield does not necessarily drive a corresponding change in the rates credited on certain insurance liabilities. The decrease in investment yields was partially offset by the impact of lower crediting rates in 2015, which resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $15 million.\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. Our life and AD&D businesses experienced favorable mortality in 2015, mainly due to favorable claims experience, which resulted in a $45 million increase in operating earnings. Less favorable reserve development in our dental business was partially offset by favorable morbidity experience in our long-term care and disability businesses, and resulted in a $14 million decrease in operating earnings. The favorable claims experience in our long-term care business was due to higher net closures and the impact of lapses on certain insurance liabilities. In our disability business, the favorable claims experience was primarily driven by fewer approvals, a reduction in the average size of claims and higher net closures. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a $23 million increase in operating earnings.\nCorporate Benefit Funding\nBusiness Overview. Funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S&P 500 companies continued to fall in 2015, limiting their ability to engage in full pension plan buyouts. However, we expect that customers may choose to close out portions of pension plans over time, with the largest volume of business generally occurring near the end of any year. Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S&P 500 companies, higher pension risk transfers resulted in an increase in premiums. In addition, more competitive pricing in the market drove a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales. Changes in premiums for these businesses were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>4,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>8,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>5,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>1,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>6,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. The impact of 2015 deposits and funding agreement issuances resulted in higher invested assets, which drove an increase in net investment income, partially offset by the related increase in interest credited expense, and resulted in an $85 million increase in operating earnings. Net funding agreement issuances were higher in 2014 to take advantage of favorable market conditions in advance of scheduled contract maturities.\nMarket Factors. The sustained low interest rate environment impacted our investment yields, as well as our interest credited rates. Lower interest rates drove lower investment yields on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as from our securities lending program. In addition, weaker equity markets in 2015 resulted in lower returns on other limited partnership interests. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on interest rate and currency derivatives, alternative investments, real estate and real estate joint ventures, as well as the favorable impact of a conversion of the securities accounting system. Many of our funding agreement and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to external indices and, as a result, we set lower interest credited rates on new business, as well as on existing business with terms that can fluctuate. The impact of lower investment returns, partially offset by lower interest credited expense, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $93 million.\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable mortality in our pension risk transfer and structured settlement businesses was partially offset by more favorable mortality from our income annuity and specialized life insurance products, and resulted in an $11 million decrease in operating earnings. The net impact of insurance liability refinements that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 decreased operating earnings by $27 million.\nExpenses. Lower non-deferrable commissions driven by a decrease in structured settlement annuity sales, were mostly offset by slightly higher employee-related costs and annual premium tax adjustments in 2015 and resulted in a slight increase in operating earnings.\nCorporate & Other\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>1,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(397\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents operating earnings by source, net of income tax:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate initiatives and projects\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>(243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nNet Investment Income. A $204 million decrease in net investment income was driven by an increase in the amount credited to the segments due to growth in the economic capital managed by Corporate & Other on their behalf. This decrease was also impacted by the sustained low interest rate environment, which drove lower investment yields on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as lower returns on alternative investments. This was partially offset by improved returns on real estate investments.\nCorporate Initiatives and Projects. Expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects decreased by $51 million, primarily due to lower relocation costs, severance and consulting expenses associated with certain enterprise-wide initiatives.\nIncremental Tax Benefit (Expense). Corporate & Other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax differences, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. As a result, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. Our 2015 results include the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. In addition, in 2015 we had higher utilization of tax preferenced investments and other tax benefits, which improved operating earnings by $25 million over 2014.\nOther. The financial results of Corporate & Other include fees earned related to an affiliated reinsurance agreement, which were recorded in other revenues, but were almost entirely offset by related charges in other expenses. Our 2015 results include the aforementioned charge of $235 million for interest on uncertain tax positions also recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, as well as higher direct business costs of $9 million and a $7 million charge associated with company use real estate. These increases in expenses were partially offset by lower reinsurance costs of $26 million and a $21 million one-time tax refund received for a favorable outcome on prior year tax audits. Our results for 2014 include a $117 million accrual to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by GRM, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates.

A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based nonqualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the demand and supply of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility and the inherent interest rate movement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit risk, market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. Risk limits to promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit exposure as measured by our economic capital framework are approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio. For real estate assets, we manage credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and equity market risks.\nWe use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging. However, we dynamically hedge this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of our credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.\nWe generally enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring, and may include governmental intervention. With respect to credit default contracts on Western European sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association deems that a credit event has occurred.\nCurrent Environment\nThe global economy and markets continue to be affected by stress and volatility, which has adversely affected the financial services sector, in particular, and global capital markets. Recently, weakness in the energy and metals and mining sectors and political and/or economic instability of countries and regions outside the EU, including China, Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, the Middle East and Puerto Rico, as well as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain ( Europe's perimeter region\u201d) and Cyprus, have contributed to global market volatility. As an insurance company with significant operations in the U.S., we are affected by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate for the first time in 10 years and has held it steady since then. The Federal Reserve may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future, which may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S. and other developed and emerging economies, have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales. We are also affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world due to the diversification of our investment portfolio. See - Selected Country and Sector Investments.\u201d\nEuropean Region Investments\nWe maintain general account investments in certain EU member states and other countries in the region that are not members of the EU (collectively, the European Region\u201d) for diversification. We have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries, including the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway. Our total European Region general account exposure to fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock were $17.5 billion, or 6% of total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2015. Our exposure to European Region sovereign debt was $711 million, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2015. The European Region corporate securities (fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock) are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities, which comprised $12.9 billion, or 77% of European Region total corporate securities, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2015. Of these European Region sovereign fixed maturity and corporate securities, 88% were investment grade and, for the 12% that were below investment grade, the majority were non-financial services corporate securities at December 31, 2015. European Region financial services corporate securities, at estimated fair value, were $3.9 billion (including $2.1 billion within the banking sector) with 93% invested in investment grade rated corporate securities, at December 31, 2015.\nSelected Country and Sector Investments\nIn recent years, elevated levels of market volatility have affected the performance of various asset classes. Contributing factors include concerns about global economic conditions and capital markets; lower oil prices impacting the energy sector; lower commodity prices impacting the metals and mining sector; country specific volatility due to local economic and/or political concerns, including concerns over the solvency of the EU member states included in Europe's perimeter region and Cyprus, their banking systems and the financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries or their respective banking systems. While economic conditions in certain of these countries, including Europe's perimeter region, seem to be stabilizing or improving, greater European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund support, stronger liquidity facilities and gradually improving macroeconomic conditions at the country level have reduced the risk of default on sovereign debt and/or the risk of possible withdrawal of such countries from the Euro zone.\nThe following table presents, by country, a summary of fixed maturity securities in selected countries. We maintain general account investments in the selected countries through our global portfolio diversification. The Company has written credit default swaps where the underlying is an index comprised of companies across various sectors in the European Region. At December 31, 2015, the written credit default swaps exposure to Europe's perimeter region was $125 million in notional amount and $2 million in estimated fair value.

Our net exposure to energy sector fixed maturity securities was $7.1 billion (comprised of fixed maturity securities of $7.2 billion at estimated fair value, partially offset by related net purchased credit default swaps of $10 million at notional value), of which 84% were investment grade, with unrealized losses of $297 million at December 31, 2015. Our net exposure to metals and mining sector fixed maturity securities was $1.0 billion (comprised of fixed maturity securities of $1.0 billion at estimated fair value, partially offset by related net purchased credit default swaps of $5 million at notional value), of which 75% were investment grade, with unrealized losses of $160 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries, the energy sector and the metals and mining sector through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. We do not expect that our general account investments in these countries, the energy sector or the metals and mining sector will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCurrent Environment - Summary\nAll of these factors have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry, including MLIC. Such global economic conditions, as well as the global financial markets, continue to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as perpetual hybrid securities\u201d have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or Tier 1 capital\u201d and perpetual deferrable securities, or Upper Tier 2 capital\u201d).\nRedeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities. These securities, which are commonly referred to as capital securities,\u201d primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.\nValuation of Securities. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services' use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2015.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our valuation controls and procedures including our formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets.\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities - AFS\nFixed maturity and equity securities AFS measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Maturity\nSecurities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\nSecurities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>116,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>23,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant other observable inputs\n</td> <td>139,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>4,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>7,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent broker quotations\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant unobservable inputs\n</td> <td>13,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities and equity securities AFS fair value hierarchy.\nThe composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in Level 3 securities at December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities AFS were concentrated in three sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities and residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies, independent pricing services and, to a much lesser extent, independent non-binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. Rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's, S&P, Fitch, Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar, Inc. ( Morningstar\u201d). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non-agency RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS\u201d) and ABS. The NAIC's objective with the revised methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to structured securities held by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC's present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If Metropolitan Life Insurance Company or its insurance subsidiaries acquire structured securities that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a final designation becomes available.\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities by NRSRO rating and the equivalent designations of the NAIC, except for certain structured securities, which are presented using the revised NAIC methodologies as described above, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value that each designation is comprised of at:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the cash flows of mortgages into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nThe majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody's, S&P or Fitch; and were designated NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ( Alt-A\u201d) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.\nIncluded within prime and Alt-A RMBS are re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduit ( Re-REMIC\u201d) securities. Re-REMIC RMBS involve the pooling of previous issues of prime and Alt-A RMBS and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and subordinated securities. The credit enhancement on the senior tranches is improved through the re-securitization.\nHistorically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by: acquiring older vintage year securities that benefit from better underwriting, improved credit enhancement and higher levels of residential property price appreciation; reducing our overall exposure; stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions; and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Since 2012, we have increased our exposure by purchasing sub-prime RMBS at significant discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The estimated fair value of our sub-prime RMBS holdings purchased since 2012 was $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with unrealized gains of $78 million and $122 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCMBS\nOur CMBS holdings are diversified by vintage year.

Impairments of fixed maturity securities were $54 million, $26 million and $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Impairments of equity securities were $37 million, $21 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCredit-related impairments of fixed maturity securities were $54 million, $26 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOverall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The most significant increases were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities, which comprised $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. An increase of $30 million in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities reflected the impact of weakening foreign currencies on non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities and lower oil prices impacting the energy sector. The $30 million increase in OTTI losses on U.S. and foreign corporate securities was concentrated in the utility and consumer services industries.\nFuture Impairments\nFuture OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods.\nTrading and FVO Securities\nWe have a trading securities portfolio, principally invested in fixed maturity securities, to support investment strategies that involve the active and frequent purchase and sale of securities and the execution of short sale agreements. Trading and FVO securities also include FVO securities. FVO securities include certain fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support ALM strategies for certain insurance products. FVO securities also include securities held by CSEs. Trading and FVO securities were $431 million and $705 million at estimated fair value, or 0.2% of total cash and invested assets at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the trading and FVO securities fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for trading and FVO securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSecurities Lending\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. We monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. We are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received.\nSee - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Securities Lending\u201d and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our securities lending program.\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loans are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties.

Such amounts are presented in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe diversify our mortgage loan portfolio by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios, 85% are collateralized by properties located in the U.S., with the remaining 15% collateralized by properties located outside the U.S., at December 31, 2015. The carrying value of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans located in California, New York and Texas were 18%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of total mortgage loans at December 31, 2015. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\nWe manage our residential mortgage loan portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration. All residential mortgage loans were collateralized by properties located in the U.S. at December 31, 2015. The carrying value of our residential mortgage loans located in California, Florida, and New York were 39%, 8%, and 6%, respectively.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type. Commercial mortgage loans are the largest component of the mortgage loan invested asset class, as such loans represented over 60% of total mortgage loans at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, as well as impaired mortgage loans. See - Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\u201d for real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nWe review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.\nLoan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 52% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.6x at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 44% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nMortgage Loan Valuation Allowances. Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.\nThe determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.\nSee Notes 1, 8 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored, activity in and balances of the valuation allowance, and the estimated fair value of impaired mortgage loans and related impairments included within net investment gains (losses) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nWe diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. Our real estate investments are primarily located in the United States.

Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nDerivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2015 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At December 31, 2015, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.\nCredit Risk\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.\nOur policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe following table presents the gross

default swaps of $16 million was due to credit spreads widening in the current period compared to the prior period on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds. The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of ($56) million was due to certain credit spreads widening in the current period compared to the prior period on certain credit default swaps used as replications.\nThe maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by insurance regulators and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we will seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we, at times, can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for net embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nIn addition to the Credit Facility, Missouri Reinsurance, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, along with MetLife, Inc., maintain a $210 million committed facility, which is used for collateral for certain of MLIC's affiliated reinsurance liabilities, with unaffiliated financial institutions (the Committed Facility\u201d). See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Global Funding Sources - Credit and Committed Facilities\u201d and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further descriptions of such arrangements, the classification of expenses on the Credit Facility and the Committed Facility and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on such facilities.\nCollateral for Securities Lending and Derivatives\nWe participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. Periodically, we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties on deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this collateral was $22 million and $19 million at estimated fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as - Investments - Securities Lending\u201d for discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangement and associated liability.\nWe enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We have non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In certain instances, cash collateral pledged to the Company as initial margin for OTC-bilateral derivatives is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the Company's balance sheet because the account title is in the name of the counterparty (but segregated for the benefit of the Company). The amount of this cash collateral was $138 million at December 31, 2014. We did not hold any cash collateral of this type at December 31, 2015. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral\u201d and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.\nLease Commitments\nAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space, information technology and other equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nSee Guarantees\u201d in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nAdditionally, we enter into the following commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Net Investment Income\u201d and Net Investment Gains (Losses)\u201d in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, gains and losses from such investments.

See - Investments - Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\u201d and - Investments - Other Limited Partnership Interests\u201d for information on our partnership investments.\nOther than the commitments disclosed in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. For further information on commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nInsolvency Assessments\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. The global markets and economy continue to experience volatility that may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.\nShort-term Liquidity\nWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $2.7 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including: (i) amounts related to cash collateral received under our securities lending program; (ii) amounts related to cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives; and (iii) cash held in the closed block.\nLiquid Assets\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $92.0 billion and $94.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include: (i) amounts related to cash collateral received under our securities lending program; (ii) amounts related to cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives; (iii) cash and investments held in the closed block or on deposit with regulatory agencies; (iv) investments held in trust; and (v) investments pledged in support of funding agreements, derivatives and short sale agreements.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to a company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources and various credit facilities.\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities if there is a need to sell such securities, which may negatively impact our financial condition. See Risk Factors - Investment-Related Risks - Should the Need Arise, We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value Given Their Illiquid Nature.\u201d\nIn extreme circumstances, all general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\nRating Agencies\nRating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to certain of MetLife, Inc.'s life insurance subsidiaries, including us, and credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including our insurance companies. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Credit ratings indicate the rating agency's opinion regarding a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its insurance subsidiaries are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. See Business - Company Ratings\u201d for further information on our insurer financial strength ratings.\nDowngrades in our insurer financial strength ratings or changes to our ratings outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>requiring us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing and derivative transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A downgrade in MetLife, Inc.'s or our credit ratings or changes to MetLife, Inc.'s or our ratings outlooks would likely impact us in the following ways, including:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our Corporate Benefit Funding segment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact the cost and availability of financing for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. See - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Statutory Capital and Dividends\nOur insurance companies have statutory surplus and RBC levels well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and most of its insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and each of its insurance subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\nThe amount of the dividend that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company can pay to MetLife, Inc. is constrained by the amount of surplus Metropolitan Life Insurance Company holds to maintain its ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in MLIC's businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company by its insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company cedes specific policy classes, including ordinary life insurance, participating whole life insurance, long-term disability insurance and group life insurance, to a wholly-owned captive reinsurer. The wholly-owned captive reinsurer currently only reinsures Metropolitan Life Insurance Company business and the results of the captive reinsurer are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. In addition, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company reinsures specific policy classes, including term life insurance, universal life insurance and ordinary and industrial life insurance, to other affiliated captive reinsurers. The statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. MetLife, Inc. has committed to maintain the surplus of certain of these domestic affiliated captive reinsurers, as well as provided a guarantee of one such captive reinsurer's repayment obligations on the letters of credit. MetLife, Inc. has also provided a guarantee of a captive reinsurer's payment obligations on a retrocession agreement entered into by the captive. We enter into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to satisfy statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies.\nThe NAIC continues to review insurance companies' use of affiliated captive reinsurers and off-shore entities. The New York Department of Financial Services continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. We are not aware of any states other than New York and California implementing such a moratorium. While such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our RBC ratios and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. This could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. While this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. We continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results.\nOur variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefit risks and certain other risks were previously ceded to an affiliated captive reinsurer. In November 2014, this captive reinsurer merged with and into MetLife USA as part of the Mergers, further reducing the Company's exposure to and use of captive reinsurers. See Business - Overview\u201d for further information on the Mergers.

The principal cash outflows relate to various life insurance, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption.\nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends on Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's common stock, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in - Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,\u201d the following additional information is provided regarding our primary sources of liquidity and capital:\nGlobal Funding Sources\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\nCommercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\nMetLife Funding and MetLife, Inc., each have a commercial paper program that is supported by the Credit Facility (see - Credit and Committed Facilities\u201d). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company and certain of its insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional FHLB. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we issued $17.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, and repaid $17.7 billion, $9.9 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $13.3 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSpecial Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements, which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain SPEs that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we issued $35.1 billion, $36.7 billion and $26.8 billion, respectively, and repaid $35.5 billion, $31.7 billion and $25.1 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $29.5 billion and $30.3 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe have issued funding agreements to Farmer Mac, as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we issued $50 million and $200 million, respectively, and repaid $50 million and $200 million, respectively, under such funding agreements. We neither issued nor repaid any amounts under such funding agreements during the year ended December 31, 2013. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.6 billion. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt Issuances\nIn December 2015, MetLife Private Equity Holdings, LLC ( MPEH\u201d), a wholly-owned indirect investment subsidiary of MLIC, borrowed $350 million under term loans that mature in December 2020. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nMetLife Funding and MetLife, Inc. maintain the Credit Facility. When drawn upon, this facility bears interest at varying rates in accordance with the agreement.\nThis facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers' commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $484 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. Remaining availability was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2015.\nThe Committed Facility is used for collateral for certain of MLIC's affiliated reinsurance liabilities. When drawn upon, this facility bears interest at varying rates in accordance with the agreement. At December 31, 2015, MoRe had outstanding $210 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. There was no remaining availability at December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these facilities.\nWe have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nOutstanding Debt Under Global Funding Sources\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt at:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1), (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes $11 million and $13 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of long-term debt relating to CSEs - FVO (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

We believe we were in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in - Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\u201d and - Contractual Obligations,\u201d the following additional information is provided regarding our primary uses of liquidity and capital:\nDividends\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company paid cash dividends to MetLife, Inc. of $1.5 billion, $708 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2014, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company distributed to MetLife, Inc., as a dividend, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of its wholly-owned, broker-dealer subsidiary, NES. The net book value of NES at the time of the dividend was $35 million. See Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn March 15, 2016, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company paid an ordinary cash dividend to MetLife, Inc. of $1.5 billion.\nDebt Repayments\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt, including:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In December 2015, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of the Company repaid in cash $110 million of its mortgage loans issued to MetLife USA due in January 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In November 2015, the Company repaid in cash, at maturity, $188 million of surplus notes issued to MetLife Mexico S.A., an affiliate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In November 2015, the Company repaid in cash, at maturity, $200 million of surplus notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2015, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of the Company repaid in cash $132 million of its 7.26% mortgage loans issued to MetLife USA due in January 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In November 2014, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of the Company repaid in cash $60 million of its 7.01% mortgage loans issued to MetLife USA due in January 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In November 2014, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of the Company repaid in cash $60 million of its 4.67% mortgage loans issued to MetLife USA due in January 2017; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In September 2014, the Company repaid in cash, at maturity, $217 million of surplus notes issued to MetLife Mexico S.A.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Support Agreements\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company and certain of its subsidiaries (each, an Obligor\u201d) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries or former subsidiaries of such Obligors. Under these arrangements, each Obligor with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet anticipated demands.\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the Retail segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. In the Corporate Benefit Funding segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the Corporate Benefit Funding segment liabilities that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, as of December 31, 2015, there were no funding agreements and other capital market products that could be put back to the Company.\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were obligated to return cash collateral pledged to the Company of $3.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had pledged cash collateral of $61 million and $73 million, respectively. With respect to OTC-bilateral derivatives in a net liability position that have financial strength contingent provisions, a one-notch downgrade in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's or its subsidiaries' financial strength rating would not have increased our derivative collateral requirements at December 31, 2015.\nWe pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurities Lending\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $18.1 billion and $21.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at December 31, 2015 was $6.1 billion, over 99% of which were U.S. Treasury and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements to immediately return the cash collateral. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLitigation\nPutative or certified class action litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments against us, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, in connection with our activities as an insurer, investor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, based on information currently known by us, in our opinion, the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at December 31, 2015:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than One Year to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than Three Years to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>133,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n</td> <td>21,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>3,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitments\n</td> <td>8,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>29,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Liabilities\nInsurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. All estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. Because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. Additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years of $224.8 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $128.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; and (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and are partially offset by liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP. See - Policyholder Account Balances.\u201d\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nSee Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. See - Insurance Liabilities\u201d regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\nAmounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years of $133.9 billion exceeds the liability amount of $94.4 billion included on the consolidated balance sheets principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nPayables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nWe have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivatives. As the securities lending transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table. We also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet, of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015.\nDebt\nAmounts presented for debt include short-term debt and long-term debt, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet due to the following: (i) the amounts presented herein do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) the amounts presented herein include future interest on such obligations for the period from January 1, 2016 through maturity; and (iii) the amounts presented herein do not include $11 million at December 31, 2015 of long-term debt relating to CSEs as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. Future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at December 31, 2015 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations. Total debt at December 31, 2015 included affiliated debt obligations of $2.0 billion.\nInvestment Commitments\nTo enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. In the table, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. As it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. Commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\u201d\nOperating Leases\nAs a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. Contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. However, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nOther obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. If the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. Items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $1.7 billion was excluded as the timing of payment cannot be reliably determined.\nSeparate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.\nWe also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at December 31, 2015.\nAdditionally, we have agreements in place for services we provide, generally at cost, to subsidiaries and affiliates relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nIn this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP financial measures:\n</td> <td>Comparable GAAP financial measures:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>operating revenues\n</td> <td>(i)\n</td> <td>GAAP revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>operating expenses\n</td> <td>(ii)\n</td> <td>GAAP expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>operating earnings\n</td> <td>(iii)\n</td> <td>income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in - Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies:\nOperating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIndex to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information\nFor purposes of this discussion, MLIC,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation incorporated in 1868, and its subsidiaries. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, operating earnings, that is not based on GAAP. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for definitions of this and other measures.\nOverview\nThe Company is a provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management and is organized into three segments: Retail; Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; and Corporate Benefit Funding. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. See also - Other Key Information\u201d for information on MetLife, Inc.'s announcement of its plan to pursue the Separation. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nOther Key Information\nOn February 28, 2016, MetLife, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement with MassMutual pursuant to which MassMutual will acquire MetLife's U.S. Retail advisor force, the MetLife Premier Client Group, together with its affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., and certain related assets. As part of the transaction, MetLife, Inc. and MassMutual have also agreed to enter into a product development agreement under which MetLife's U.S. Retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by MassMutual. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval.\nOn January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. MetLife is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the SEC filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. MetLife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not be a part of the Separation. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company would no longer write new retail life and annuity business post-Separation.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented certain segment reporting changes related to the measurement of segment operating earnings, which included revising the Company's capital allocation methodology. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated operating earnings or net income. Consequently, prior period results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were impacted as follows:\n \u2022 Retail's operating earnings increased by $145 million, net of $49 million of income tax benefit; \n \u2022 Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits' operating earnings decreased by $19 million, net of $13 million of income tax benefit; \n \u2022 Corporate Benefit Funding's operating earnings decreased by $60 million, net of $41 million of income tax benefit; and \n \u2022 Corporate & Other's operating earnings decreased by $66 million, net of $103 million of income tax expense.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance; \n (ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA; \n\n (iv) investment impairments; \n (v) estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; \n (vi) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; \n\n In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are deferred as DAC. In addition to commissions and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $50 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.25%.\nWe also periodically review other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to AFS securities is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee Notes 1 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales declined from 2014 levels; however, sales experience was positive across various products within our businesses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The introduction of new variable annuity products in late 2014 and early 2015, as well as pricing actions and our continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs, all contributed to higher sales in our Retail segment. For our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, 2015 sales were slightly lower, as improved sales of voluntary products were more than offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition. Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S&P 500 companies, we experienced an increase in sales of pension risk transfers. However, more competitive pricing", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d project,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe\u201d and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, operating earnings, that is not based on GAAP. Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for definitions of this and other measures.\nOverview\nThe Company is a provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management and is organized into three segments: Retail; Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; and Corporate Benefit Funding. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. See also - Other Key Information\u201d for information on MetLife, Inc.'s announcement of its plan to pursue the Separation. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nOther Key Information\nOn February 28, 2016, MetLife, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement with MassMutual pursuant to which MassMutual will acquire MetLife's U.S. Retail advisor force, the MetLife Premier Client Group, together with its affiliated broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., and certain related assets. As part of the transaction, MetLife, Inc. and MassMutual have also agreed to enter into a product development agreement under which MetLife's U.S. Retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by MassMutual. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval.\nOn January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. MetLife is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the SEC filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. MetLife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will not be a part of the Separation. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company would no longer write new retail life and annuity business post-Separation.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, the Company implemented certain segment reporting changes related to the measurement of segment operating earnings, which included revising the Company's capital allocation methodology. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on total consolidated operating earnings or net income. Consequently, prior period results for the year ended December 31, 2014 were impacted as follows:\n \u2022 Retail's operating earnings increased by $145 million, net of $49 million of income tax benefit; \n \u2022 Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits' operating earnings decreased by $19 million, net of $13 million of income tax benefit; \n \u2022 Corporate Benefit Funding's operating earnings decreased by $60 million, net of $41 million of income tax benefit; and \n \u2022 Corporate & Other's operating earnings decreased by $66 million, net of $103 million of income tax expense.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance; \n (ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA; \nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (iv) investment impairments; \n (v) estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; \n (vi) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; \nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td> measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are deferred as DAC. In addition to commissions and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $50 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.25%.\nWe also periodically review other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to AFS securities is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee Notes 1 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, operating earnings or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales declined from 2014 levels; however, sales experience was positive across various products within our businesses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The introduction of new variable annuity products in late 2014 and early 2015, as well as pricing actions and our continued focus on our enhanced underwriting programs, all contributed to higher sales in our Retail segment. For our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, 2015 sales were slightly lower, as improved sales of voluntary products were more than offset by lower sales of our core group products as a result of increased competition. Despite the decline in funding ratios for defined benefit pension plans of S&P 500 companies, we experienced an increase in sales of pension risk transfers. However, more competitive pricing"}
