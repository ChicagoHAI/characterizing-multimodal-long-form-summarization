Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2020, we owned a portfolio of 31 premium hotels and resorts that contain 10,102 guest rooms located in 21 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our hotel in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Frenchman's Reef, remains closed due to damage incurred by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAs an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers and hotel brands, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u2022Occupancy percentage;\n\u2022Average Daily Rate (or ADR);\n\u2022Rooms Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR);\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate (or EBITDAre), and Adjusted EBITDA; and\n\u2022Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 66% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, increased use of lodging alternatives, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The pandemic has significantly reduced travel and adversely affected the hospitality industry in general. We have seen, and expect to continue to see, significant reductions in lodging demand generators, including city-wide conferences, sporting and entertainment events, corporate and leisure travel, and overall domestic airlift capacity, compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have taken the following proactive measures at the property and corporate levels:\n\u2022In coordination with our hotel operators, we suspended operations at 20 of our 30 previously operating hotels throughout March and April 2020. As of March 1, 2021, 26 of our 30 previously operating hotels were open.\n\u2022We developed and implemented action plans with our hotel operators to significantly reduce operating costs at each of our hotels and cultivate alternative demand, where possible.\n\u2022We canceled or deferred over 65% of our capital expenditures planned for 2020.\n\u2022We paused the rebuild of Frenchman's Reef, which we had previously planned to open as two separate hotels in late 2020, and renegotiated existing construction contracts, saving the Company significant cash outlays for construction. In late 2020, we initiated a process to explore alternatives for completing the rebuild, including finding a capital partner, and we expect to complete that process later in 2021.\n\u2022We suspended our quarterly common dividend to common stockholders beginning with the dividend that would have been paid in April 2020. The resumption in quarterly common dividends will be determined by our board of directors after considering our projected taxable income, obligations under our financing agreements, expected capital requirements, and risks affecting our business.\n\u2022We drew down funds on our $400 million senior unsecured credit facility in March 2020 to enhance our liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $345 million of borrowing capacity on our the senior unsecured credit facility and $111.8 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\n\u2022On June 9, 2020, we executed amendments to the credit agreements for our $400 million senior unsecured credit facility and $400 million of unsecured term loans that provided for a waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants beginning with the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021 and certain other modifications to the covenants thereafter through the fourth quarter of 2021. On January 20, 2021, we executed additional amendments to extend the waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants through the fourth quarter of 2021 and certain other modifications to the covenants thereafter through the first quarter of 2023.\n\u2022On June 25, 2020, we refinanced our only significant near-term debt maturity by closing on a $48.0 million mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown at City Creek (the \"Salt Lake City Marriott\"). The loan proceeds were used to repay the existing $52.5 million mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott that was scheduled to mature on November 1, 2020. The new loan matures in January 2022 with an option to extend maturity to January 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\u2022In July 2020, we negotiated and entered into an amendment to the loan secured by the Westin Boston Waterfront, which is the Company's largest mortgage loan. The amendment enabled the Company to use funds in the reserve for replacement of furniture and fixtures to pay debt service for three months.\n\u2022In 2020, we issued a total of 4,760,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of $114.5 million, and 10,680,856 shares of common stock, for net proceeds of $86.8 million.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. Market demand for lodging at our hotels is closely correlated with reported infection levels near our hotel locations, consumer confidence, and guidance from health officials and federal, state, and local governments.\nSee also Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nOutlook for 2021\nThe U.S. economy is in the early stages of recovering from a global pandemic that disproportionately impacted the travel industry. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, corporate profits, TSA checkpoint data, and consumer confidence are exhibiting steady improvement, but have yet to reattain pre-pandemic levels of activity. We expect the U.S. will experience RevPAR growth in 2021 from 2020 levels, due to the availability and administration of vaccines, disruption of existing room supply, and growing demand for travel.\nOur portfolio is composed primarily of destination resorts and hotels in the 25 largest urban markets. We expect our destination hotels will continue to outperform the broader U.S. market for the foreseeable future. The strong preference for drive-to leisure destinations, while most work and school are executed virtually, is expected to persist into 2021. Longer term,\nwe believe strong, secular demand for experiential leisure travel, low growth in directly competitive supply, and targeted investments to renovate and reposition destination hotels can extend and intensify our Company's growth. Urban hotels should also experience strong growth in 2021, but we expect the pace of recovery in these markets will lag the U.S. overall as employers are reticent to resume business travel and conference activity until there is definitive progress on the pandemic. Early indications suggest that business travel activity is likely to resume in late 2021. Historically, total group revenues comprise approximately one-third of our total room revenue, but group revenue at large conference hotels accounted for less than 10% of our total rooms revenue. We anticipate industry profitability will be challenged by low occupancy and a short booking window and guest mix that makes it challenging to maximize room rates. We continue to work closely with our hotel managers to maximize revenue and identify operating efficiencies.\nWe expect the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will enable the industry to gradually return to profitability by late-2021, and we enter the year with several favorable factors, including the following: (1) ownership of a high-quality portfolio, with a meaningful concentration in destination resort locations, (2) internal growth from the continuation of our asset management initiatives, (3) expense savings from the conversion of six formerly Marriott-managed contracts to Marriott franchises, (4) conservative debt capital structure with limited near-term debt maturities, and (5) and liquidity of $481.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nDiscussion of the comparison of the results of operations from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018 is found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 under Part II, Item 7, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information for the year ended December 31, 2020 for each of the hotels we owned during 2020. The table indicates the operating status of each hotel and the occupancy percentage, ADR and RevPAR for each hotel for the portion of the year ended December 31, 2020 that the hotel was open.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotels Open Throughout the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nRooms </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupancy (%) </td> <td> </td> <td>ADR ($) </td> <td> </td> <td>RevPAR($) </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nfrom 2019 RevPAR </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown at City Creek </td> <td> </td> <td>Salt Lake City, Utah </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worthington Renaissance Fort Worth Hotel </td> <td> </td> <td>Fort Worth, Texas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>168.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin San Diego Downtown </td> <td> </td> <td>San Diego, California </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>168.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort </td> <td> </td> <td>Fort Lauderdale, Florida </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>212.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Washington D.C.

Seventeen of these hotels reopened by December 31, 2020. Three of our\npreviously operating hotels remained closed as of December 31, 2020.\nThe comparability of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the comparability of our results of operations in certain future periods will be similarly impacted.\nRevenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $7.6 million of severance costs at our properties in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in connection with the change in hotel manager of the Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel, we recognized $1.4 million of accelerated amortization of the unfavorable management agreement liability during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced base management fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily due to the timing of fully depreciated capital expenditures.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $174.1 million related to Frenchman's Reef. No impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.8 million, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation, travel costs, and certain professional fees, partially offset by an increase in legal fees.\nBusiness interruption insurance income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.2 million of business interruption insurance income related to lost revenue at the Westin Boston Waterfront due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to Frenchman's Reef and resulted in lost revenue and additional expenses covered under our insurance policy. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $8.8 million of business interruption insurance income related to the Frenchman's Reef insurance claim.\nGain on property insurance settlement. In December 2019, we settled our insurance claim for the property damage related to Frenchman's Reef. We recognized a gain on insurance settlement of $144.2 million, which represents the net proceeds received in excess of the carrying amount of the damaged property written off.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense was $54.0 million and $46.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and is comprised of the following (in millions):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan interest </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility interest and unused fees </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premium </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swap mark-to-market </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest expense is primarily related to the mark-to-market of our interest rate swaps.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. On July 25, 2019, we refinanced our senior unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans. In connection with the refinancing we repaid our previously existing $100 million and $200 million term loans and recognized a $2.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIncome taxes. We recorded income tax benefit of $26.5 million in 2020 and income tax expense of $22.0 million in 2019. The 2020 income tax benefit is net of a valuation allowance of $24.9 million, which was recognized based on an assessment of our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in future years. The 2019 income tax expense includes $1.2 million of income tax expense incurred on the $5.7 million pre-tax income of our domestic TRSs, foreign income tax expense of $20.8 million incurred on the $132.6 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay our scheduled debt service and operating expenses and capital expenditures directly associated with our hotels. We have suspended our quarterly common dividend. We currently expect that our existing cash balances and available capacity on our senior unsecured credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\nSome of our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap\u201d provisions that are triggered when the hotel's operating results\nfall below a certain debt service coverage ratio. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. As of December 31, 2020, the debt service coverage ratios or debt yields for all of our mortgage loans were below the minimum thresholds such that the cash trap provision of each respective loan was triggered, with the exception of the mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown at City Creek, which does not have a cash trap provision. We do not expect that such cash traps will affect our ability to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels, renovations, and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels, scheduled debt payments, debt maturities, redemption of limited operating partnership units ( common OP units\u201d) and making distributions to our common and preferred stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including cash provided by operations, borrowings, issuances of additional equity, including common OP units, and/or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the state of the credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders. Our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets, investor sentiment and intended use of proceeds. We may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives and require liquidity in excess of existing cash balances. Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on, among other things, general market conditions for hotel companies and REITs and market perceptions about us.\nOur Financing Strategy\nSince our formation in 2004, we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. Our outstanding debt consists of fixed interest rate mortgage debt, unsecured term loans and borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility. We have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide balance sheet flexibility. We expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle. We believe that it is prudent to reduce the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through a low leverage capital structure.\nWe prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure. We generally structure our hotel acquisitions to be straightforward and to fit within our capital structure; however, we will consider a more complex transaction, such as the issuance of common OP units in connection with the acquisition of Cavallo Point, if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available.\nWe believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.89% and a weighted average maturity date of approximately 3.5 years. We have limited near-term mortgage debt maturities and 23 of our 31 hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt. We remain committed to our core strategy of prudent leverage.\nInformation about our financing activities is available in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Further information is available in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for measures taken in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nATM Program\nWe have equity distribution agreements, dated August 8, 2018, with a number of sales agents (the ATM Program\u201d) to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $200 million (the ATM Shares\u201d). Sales of the ATM Shares can be made in privately negotiated transactions and/or any other method permitted by law, including sales deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering, which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange. Actual future sales of the ATM Shares will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, and the Company's capital needs. We have no obligation to sell the ATM Shares under the ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 10,680,856 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.23 per share for gross proceeds of $87.9 million, less $1.1 million in fees paid to the applicable sales agent and other offering costs. As of March 1, 2021, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $112.1 million remained available for sale under the ATM Program.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2018, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program\u201d) authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate price of up to $250 million. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 1,119,438 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.91 per share for a total purchase price of $10.0 million. These shares were all repurchased prior to March 4, 2020. We retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates. We subsequently suspended share repurchases and, pursuant to the amendments to the agreements governing our senior unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans, may not repurchase shares while our financial covenant requirements are waived or modified. The Share Repurchase Program expired on November 5, 2020. At the time of expiration, we had $165.2 million of unused repurchase capacity under the Share Repurchase Program. Information about the Share Repurchase Program can be found in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nPreferred Shares\nIn August and September 2020, we issued a total of 4,760,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of $114.5 million. On or after August 31, 2025, the Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the redemption date.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOther than borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, we do not utilize short-term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements.\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans\nWe are party to a $400 million senior unsecured credit facility expiring in July 2023, a $350 million unsecured term loan maturing in July 2024 and a $50 million unsecured term loan maturing in October 2023. The maturity date for the senior unsecured credit facility may be extended for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. On June 9, 2020, we executed amendments (the First Amendments\u201d) to the credit agreements (the Credit Agreements\u201d) for our $400 million senior unsecured credit facility and $400 million of unsecured term loans. The First Amendments provided for a waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants beginning with the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021 and certain other modifications to the covenants thereafter through the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOn August 14, 2020, we entered into additional amendments (the Second Amendments\u201d) that permits us to pay dividends on preferred stock up to $17.5 million annually. On January 20, 2021, we executed additional amendments (the Third Amendments\u201d and together with the First Amendments and Second Amendments, the Credit Agreement Amendments\u201d) to the Credit Agreements to extend the existing waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants through the fourth quarter of 2021, unless terminated early at our option. The Third Amendments also extend the modification of certain financial covenants, once quarterly testing resumes, through the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2020, we had $55.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit facility.\nAdditional information about the Credit Agreements, including the restrictions imposed by the Credit Agreement Amendments and their impacts on our liquidity, sources of capital, and ability to incur additional debt, can be found in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of cash are net cash flow from hotel operations, sales of common and preferred stock, debt financings and proceeds from hotel dispositions. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, debt service and maturities, share repurchases, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate expenses, and distributions to holders of common stock, common units and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had $111.8 million of unrestricted corporate cash and $23.1 million of restricted cash, and $55.0 million of outstanding borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility.\nOur net cash used in operations was $83.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations, offset by cash paid for corporate expenses and other working capital changes.\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is composed of capital expenditures at our operating hotels of $47.1 million, capital expenditures for the rebuild of Frenchman's Reef of $40.9 million, and $1.6 million of cash paid for the acquisition of the remaining interest in land underlying the Kimpton Shorebreak Resort, offset by $10.7 million of proceeds from our property insurance policy related to our hotels impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of $48.0 million in proceeds of mortgage debt, $86.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Program, and $114.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, offset by $20.0 million in net repayments on our senior unsecured credit facility, $55.5 million repayment of mortgage debt from the refinancing of the mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott and the repayment of the loan assumed in connection with the acquisition of the Hotel Palomar Phoenix under a qualified New Market Tax Credit program, $25.6 million of distribution paid to holders of common stock and units, $3.3 million of distributions paid to holders of preferred stock, $14.4 million of scheduled mortgage debt principal payments, $1.4 million of financing costs related to the amendment and restatement of our credit agreements, $1.3 million paid to repurchase shares upon the vesting of restricted stock for the payment of tax withholdings obligations, $10.0 million paid to repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program, and $0.2 million paid for the redemption of common OP units.\nWe currently anticipate our significant sources of cash for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be the net cash flow from hotel operations as the lodging disruptions from COVID-19 subside, potential property dispositions, and potential sales of common stock under our ATM Program. We expect our estimated uses of cash for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be scheduled debt service payments, capital expenditures, potential funding of hotel working capital requirements, distributions on common stock and units, distributions to preferred stockholders, and corporate expenses.\nDividend Policy\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our REIT taxable income to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings (other than the earnings of our TRS, which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates) and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to REITs under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least:\n\u202290% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, plus\n\u202290% of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code, minus\n\u2022any excess non-cash income.\nThe timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors, including our financial performance, restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditure requirements, the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nOur board of directors suspended the quarterly common dividend commencing with the first quarter dividend that would have been paid in April 2020. The resumption in quarterly common dividends will be determined by our board of directors after considering our projected taxable income, obligations under our financing agreements, expected capital requirements, and risks affecting our business.\nWe have paid the following dividends to holders of our common stock and distributions to holders of units during 2020 and 2019, and through the date of this report:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend\nper Share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 14, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 4, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 28, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 11, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 13, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 2, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have paid the following dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock during 2020, and through the date of this report:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend\nper Share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 20, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 18, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.516 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had no preferred stock outstanding during 2019.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement reserves to cover, among other things, the cost of replacing and repairing furniture, fixtures and equipment at our hotels and other routine capital expenditures. Contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues. In addition, we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement reserves under the applicable management or franchise agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have set aside $15.8 million for capital projects in property improvement funds, which are included in restricted cash.\nWe spent approximately $47.1 million on capital improvements at our operating hotels and approximately $40.9 million on the rebuild of Frenchman's Reef during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we canceled\nor deferred a significant portion of the planned capital improvements at our operating hotels and paused the rebuild of Frenchman's Reef.\nWe continue to be extremely selective with capital expenditures in an effort to preserve liquidity. In 2021, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on necessary capital improvements and a select few transformational projects with attractive returns on investment. Significant projects in 2021 are expected to include the following:\n\u2022The Lodge at Sonoma: We are completing a renovation to reposition and rebrand the hotel to an Autograph Collection Hotel in the third quarter of 2021. The renovation includes a new Michael Mina restaurant.\n\u2022Vail Marriott Mountain Resort: We plan to complete the final phase of a multi-year renovation to rebrand the hotel as a Luxury Collection Hotel in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022JW Marriott Denver Cherry Creek: We plan to complete the renovations in the second half of 2021 to rebrand the hotel as a Luxury Collection Hotel.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our debt and other commitments of our operating partnership as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations Including Interest (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,138,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>774,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>755,089 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,912,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>332,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>766,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>755,089 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(1) The interest expense for our variable rate loans is calculated based on the rate as of December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 included construction contract commitments of approximately $102.5 million for capital expenditures at our properties. This amount includes construction contract commitments of approximately $84.3 million for the reconstruction of Frenchman's Reef, which is currently paused. Our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work. If cancellation of a contract occurred, our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date, in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nUse and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and FFO\nEBITDA represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( Nareit\u201d) guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\u201d EBITDAre represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) adjusted for: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property, including gains or losses on change of control; (5) impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate; and (6) adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization, and in the case of EBITDAre, impairment and gains or losses on dispositions of depreciated property) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA and EBITDAre as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Nareit, which defines FFO as net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results.\nAdjustments to EBITDAre and FFO\nWe adjust EBITDAre and FFO when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO, when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDAre and FFO, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated operating performance. We adjust EBITDAre and FFO for the following items:\n\u2022Non-Cash Lease Expense and Other Amortization: We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of expense from our ground leases and other contractual obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable and unfavorable contracts, originally recorded in conjunction with certain hotel acquisitions. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual cash amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period.\n\u2022Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle: The Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates new accounting standards that require or permit the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company's actual underlying performance for the current period.\n\u2022Gains or Losses from Early Extinguishment of Debt: We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company's capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels.\n\u2022Hotel Acquisition Costs: We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.\n\u2022Severance Costs: We exclude corporate severance costs, or reversals thereof, incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations or structured severance programs because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.\n\u2022Hotel Manager Transition Items: We exclude the transition items associated with a change in hotel manager because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.\n\u2022Other Items: From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Such items may include, but are not limited to the following: pre-opening costs incurred with newly developed hotels; lease preparation costs incurred to prepare vacant space for marketing; management or franchise contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; costs incurred related to natural disasters; and gains on property insurance claim settlements, other than income related to business interruption insurance.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any unrealized fair value adjustments to interest rate swaps. We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of our U.S. GAAP net income to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(396,027) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>53,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,452) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>114,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>(253,768) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses </td> <td> </td> <td>174,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDAre\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(79,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash lease expense and other amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>6,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees and pre-opening costs related to Frenchman's Reef (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,855 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel manager transition items (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(434) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,491) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance costs (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,691 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on property insurance settlement </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(144,192) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,724) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64,512) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Represents pre-opening costs and professional fees relate to the reopening of Frenchman's Reef, as well as legal an other costs incurred at Frenchman's Reef as a result of Hurricane Irma that are not covered by insurance. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>Amount for the year ended December 31, 2020 is offset by a downward adjustment of $0.6 million to the termination fees for the Sheraton Suites Key West (now known as Barbary Beach House Key West) franchise agreement and $1.4 million of accelerated amortization of the unfavorable management agreement liability related to the manager transition at the Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates:\nInvestment in Hotels\nInvestment purchases of hotel properties, land, land improvements, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets that are not businesses are accounted for as asset acquisitions and recorded at relative fair value based upon total accumulated cost of the acquisition. Property and equipment purchased after the hotel acquisition date is recorded at cost.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five to 40 years for buildings, land improvements and building improvements and one to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and\nequipment. Identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts, including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements, which are recorded at fair value. Above-market and below-market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts. Contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value. We enter into a hotel management agreement at the time of acquisition and such agreements are generally based on market terms. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data. Management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties, current or projected losses from operations, and an expectation that the property is more likely than not to be sold significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If such events or circumstances are identified, management performs an analysis to compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the net proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel to the carrying amount of the asset. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotels' estimated fair value is recorded and an impairment loss is recognized. The fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models with estimated discount and terminal capitalization rates, comparable market transactions, third-party appraisals, the net sales proceeds from pending offers, or from transactions that closed subsequent to the end of the reporting period.\nInflation\nOperators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures or other factors may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates. Inflation may also affect our expenses, including, without limitation, increasing such costs as labor, employee-related benefits, food, commodities, taxes, property and casualty insurance and utilities.\nSeasonality\nThe periods during which our hotels experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. Accordingly, we expect some seasonality in our business. Volatility in our financial performance from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to recently issued accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of DiamondRock Hospitality Company's operations, key financial indicators, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2020, we owned a portfolio of 31 premium hotels and resorts that contain 10,102 guest rooms located in 21 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our hotel in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Frenchman's Reef, remains closed due to damage incurred by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAs an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers and hotel brands, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u2022Occupancy percentage;\n\u2022Average Daily Rate (or ADR);\n\u2022Rooms Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR);\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate (or EBITDAre), and Adjusted EBITDA; and\n\u2022Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 66% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, increased use of lodging alternatives, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The pandemic has significantly reduced travel and adversely affected the hospitality industry in general. We have seen, and expect to continue to see, significant reductions in lodging demand generators, including city-wide conferences, sporting and entertainment events, corporate and leisure travel, and overall domestic airlift capacity, compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have taken the following proactive measures at the property and corporate levels:\n\u2022In coordination with our hotel operators, we suspended operations at 20 of our 30 previously operating hotels throughout March and April 2020. As of March 1, 2021, 26 of our 30 previously operating hotels were open.\n\u2022We developed and implemented action plans with our hotel operators to significantly reduce operating costs at each of our hotels and cultivate alternative demand, where possible.\n\u2022We canceled or deferred over 65% of our capital expenditures planned for 2020.\n\u2022We paused the rebuild of Frenchman's Reef, which we had previously planned to open as two separate hotels in late 2020, and renegotiated existing construction contracts, saving the Company significant cash outlays for construction. In late 2020, we initiated a process to explore alternatives for completing the rebuild, including finding a capital partner, and we expect to complete that process later in 2021.\n\u2022We suspended our quarterly common dividend to common stockholders beginning with the dividend that would have been paid in April 2020. The resumption in quarterly common dividends will be determined by our board of directors after considering our projected taxable income, obligations under our financing agreements, expected capital requirements, and risks affecting our business.\n\u2022We drew down funds on our $400 million senior unsecured credit facility in March 2020 to enhance our liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $345 million of borrowing capacity on our the senior unsecured credit facility and $111.8 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\n\u2022On June 9, 2020, we executed amendments to the credit agreements for our $400 million senior unsecured credit facility and $400 million of unsecured term loans that provided for a waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants beginning with the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021 and certain other modifications to the covenants thereafter through the fourth quarter of 2021. On January 20, 2021, we executed additional amendments to extend the waiver of the quarterly tested financial covenants through the fourth quarter of 2021 and certain other modifications to the covenants thereafter through the first quarter of 2023.\n\u2022On June 25, 2020, we refinanced our only significant near-term debt maturity by closing on a $48.0 million mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown at City Creek (the \"Salt Lake City Marriott\"). The loan proceeds were used to repay the existing $52.5 million mortgage loan secured by the Salt Lake City Marriott that was scheduled to mature on November 1, 2020. The new loan matures in January 2022 with an option to extend maturity to January 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\u2022In July 2020, we negotiated and entered into an amendment to the loan secured by the Westin Boston Waterfront, which is the Company's largest mortgage loan. The amendment enabled the Company to use funds in the reserve for replacement of furniture and fixtures to pay debt service for three months.\n\u2022In 2020, we issued a total of 4,760,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of $114.5 million, and 10,680,856 shares of common stock, for net proceeds of $86.8 million.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. Market demand for lodging at our hotels is closely correlated with reported infection levels near our hotel locations, consumer confidence, and guidance from health officials and federal, state, and local governments.\nSee also Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nOutlook for 2021\nThe U.S. economy is in the early stages of recovering from a global pandemic that disproportionately impacted the travel industry. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, corporate profits, TSA checkpoint data, and consumer confidence are exhibiting steady improvement, but have yet to reattain pre-pandemic levels of activity. We expect the U.S. will experience RevPAR growth in 2021 from 2020 levels, due to the availability and administration of vaccines, disruption of existing room supply, and growing demand for travel.\nOur portfolio is composed primarily of destination resorts and hotels in the 25 largest urban markets. We expect our destination hotels will continue to outperform the broader U.S. market for the foreseeable future. The strong preference for drive-to leisure destinations, while most work and school are executed virtually, is expected to persist into 2021. Longer term,\nwe believe strong, secular demand for experiential leisure travel, low growth in directly competitive supply, and targeted investments to renovate and reposition destination hotels can extend and intensify our Company's growth. Urban hotels should also experience strong growth in 2021, but we expect the pace of recovery in these markets will lag the U.S. overall as employers are reticent to resume business travel and conference activity until there is definitive progress on the pandemic. Early indications suggest that business travel activity is likely to resume in late 2021. Historically, total group revenues comprise approximately one-third of our total room revenue, but group revenue at large conference hotels accounted for less than 10% of our total rooms revenue. We anticipate industry profitability will be challenged by low occupancy and a short booking window and guest mix that makes it challenging to maximize room rates. We continue to work closely with our hotel managers to maximize revenue and identify operating efficiencies.\nWe expect the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will enable the industry to gradually return to profitability by late-2021, and we enter the year with several favorable factors, including the following: (1) ownership of a high-quality portfolio, with a meaningful concentration in destination resort locations, (2) internal growth from the continuation of our asset management initiatives, (3) expense savings from the conversion of six formerly Marriott-managed contracts to Marriott franchises, (4) conservative debt capital structure with limited near-term debt maturities, and (5) and liquidity of $481.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nDiscussion of the comparison of the results of operations from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018 is found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 under Part II, Item 7, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information for the year ended December 31, 2020 for each of the hotels we owned during 2020. The table indicates the operating status of each hotel and the occupancy percentage, ADR and RevPAR for each hotel for the portion of the year ended December 31, 2020 that the hotel was open.\n\n________________\n(1)Frenchman's Reef closed on September 6, 2017 due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria and remains closed. Accordingly, there is no operating information for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)On January 3, 2021, we suspended operations at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile due to lack of travel demand.\n(3)On June 1, 2020, the hotel converted to an independent hotel, Barbary Beach House Key West.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended operations at 20 of our 30 previously operating hotels for a\nportion of the year ended December 31, 2020. Seventeen of these hotels reopened by December 31, 2020. Three of our\npreviously operating hotels remained closed as of December 31, 2020.\nThe comparability of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the comparability of our results of operations in certain future periods will be similarly impacted.\nRevenue. Revenue consists primarily of the room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, as follows (in millions):\n\nOur total revenues decreased $638.6 million from $938.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $299.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following are key hotel operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nFood and beverage revenues decreased $146.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther revenues, which primarily represent spa, parking, resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees, decreased $27.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2019.\nHotel operating expenses. The operating expenses consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nOur hotel operating expenses decreased $336.5 million from $690.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $354.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $7.6 million of severance costs at our properties in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in connection with the change in hotel manager of the Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel, we recognized $1.4 million of accelerated amortization of the unfavorable management agreement liability during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced base management fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily due to the timing of fully depreciated capital expenditures.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $174.1 million related to Frenchman's Reef. No impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.8 million, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation, travel costs, and certain professional fees, partially offset by an increase in legal fees.\nBusiness interruption insurance income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.2 million of business interruption insurance income related to lost revenue at the Westin Boston Waterfront due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to Frenchman's Reef and resulted in lost revenue and additional expenses covered under our insurance policy. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $8.8 million of business interruption insurance income related to the Frenchman's Reef insurance claim.\nGain on property insurance settlement. In December 2019, we settled our insurance claim for the property damage related to Frenchman's Reef. We recognized a gain on insurance settlement of $144.2 million, which represents the net proceeds received in excess of the carrying amount of the damaged property", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2020, we owned a portfolio of 31 premium hotels and resorts that contain 10,102 guest rooms located in 21 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our hotel in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Frenchman's Reef, remains closed due to damage incurred by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.\nAs an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers and hotel brands, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n\u2022Occupancy percentage;\n\u2022Average Daily Rate (or ADR);\n\u2022Rooms Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR);\n\u2022Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate (or EBITDAre), and Adjusted EBITDA; and\n\u2022Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO.\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole.

Room revenue comprised approximately 66% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, increased use of lodging alternatives, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business.

Additionally, in connection with the change in hotel manager of the Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel, we recognized $1.4 million of accelerated amortization of the unfavorable management agreement liability during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced base management fees.\nDepreciation and amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily due to the timing of fully depreciated capital expenditures.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $174.1 million related to Frenchman's Reef. No impairment losses were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.8 million, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation, travel costs, and certain professional fees, partially offset by an increase in legal fees.\nBusiness interruption insurance income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.2 million of business interruption insurance income related to lost revenue at the Westin Boston Waterfront due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to Frenchman's Reef and resulted in lost revenue and additional expenses covered under our insurance policy. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $8.8 million of business interruption insurance income related to the Frenchman's Reef insurance claim.\nGain on property insurance settlement. In December 2019, we settled our insurance claim for the property damage related to Frenchman's Reef. We recognized a gain on insurance settlement of $144.2 million, which represents the net proceeds received in excess of the carrying amount of the damaged property"}
