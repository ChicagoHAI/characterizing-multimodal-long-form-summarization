MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, forecasts, guidance, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for natural gas, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A . Risk Factors\u201d and Forward Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to resume making monthly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, increase our monthly cash distributions through the acquisition of additional mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2016, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in ten operating basins:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Green River Basin in Wyoming;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Piceance Basin in Colorado;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, we owned working interests in 12,589 gross (4,444 net) productive wells. In addition to these productive wells, we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells. We own working interests in approximately 677,509 gross undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells.\nThe rapid and substantial decline in oil and gas prices for an extended period of time since mid-2014 through the early part of 2016 have negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows. Further, these sustained low oil and natural gas prices have had a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases described below, we took the steps described below to provide significant incremental cash flow, to allow us to meaningfully reduce our leverage over the course of 2016 and to provide sufficient liquidity to manage the expected reductions to the borrowing base in our Reserve-Based Credit Facility:\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We significantly reduced our capital expenditures to $64.5 million in 2016 as compared to the $112.6 million spent in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 10, 2016, we issued approximately $75.6 million aggregate principal amount of new 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 in exchange for approximately $168.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2020 held by such holders. The\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Secured Second Lien Notes were issued pursuant to an exchange offer. The Senior Secured Second Lien Notes will mature on (i) February 15, 2023 or (ii) December 31, 2019 if, prior to December 31, 2019, we have not repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid in full all of the Senior Notes due 2020 outstanding at that time in excess of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount and, to the extent we have repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid the Senior Notes due 2020 with proceeds of certain indebtedness, if such indebtedness has a final maturity date no earlier than the date that is 91 days after February 15, 2023. This reduction in outstanding Senior Notes due 2020 reduced our interest expense by $7.9 million on an annual basis. Under our Credit Agreement, the issuance of new second lien debt requires, among other things, that our borrowing base decrease by 25% of the amount of new second lien debt. Because of this, in February 2016, the $1.8 billion borrowing base decreased by $18.9 million to $1.78 billion.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 25, 2016, our board of directors elected to suspend our monthly cash distribution on our common, Class B and Preferred Units effective with the February 2016 distribution.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids assets in the SCOOP/STACK area in Oklahoma to entities managed by Titanium Exploration Partners, LLC for $270.5 million (the SCOOP/STACK Divestiture\u201d). The Company used $268.4 million of the cash received to reduce borrowings under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility and $2.1 million to pay for some of the transaction fees related to the sale. We also completed sales of certain of our other properties in several different counties within our operating areas for an aggregate consideration of approximately $28.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In October 2016, in conjunction with entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment (defined in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II- Item 8.

Subsequently on December 19, 2016, Company completed a monetization of substantially all of its commodity and interest rate hedges with net proceeds totaling $11.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nChapter 11 Proceedings\nOn February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, we will continue to operate our business as debtors in possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nRestructuring Support Agreement\nPrior to the filing of the Petitions, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement\u201d) with (i) certain holders (the Consenting 2020 Noteholders\u201d) constituting approximately 52% of the 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes due 2020\u201d); (ii) certain holders (the Consenting 2019 Noteholders and, together with the Consenting 2020 Noteholders, the Consenting Senior Noteholders) constituting approximately 10% of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes due 2019,\u201d and all claims arising under or in connection with the Senior Notes due 2020 and Senior Notes due 2019, the Senior Note Claims\u201d); and (iii) certain holders (the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders\u201d and, together with the Consenting Senior Noteholders, the Restructuring Support Parties\u201d) constituting approximately 92% of the 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the Second Lien Notes,\u201d and all claims and obligations arising under or in connection with the Second Lien Notes, the Second Lien Note Claims\u201d).\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment of the Debtors and the Restructuring Support Parties to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Debtors' long-term debt (the Restructuring Transactions\u201d). The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through one or more plans of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) to be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Restructuring Transactions will be financed by (i) use of cash collateral, (ii) the proposed DIP Credit Agreement (as described below, (iii) a fully committed $19.25 million equity investment (the Second Lien Investment\u201d) by the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders and (iv) a $255.75 million rights offering (the Senior Note Rights Offering\u201d) that is fully backstopped by the Consenting Senior Noteholders.\nDebtor-in-Possession Financing\nIn connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion (the DIP Motion\u201d) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the Debtors' use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d) among VNG (the DIP Borrower\u201d), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the DIP Agent\u201d) and as issuing bank. The initial lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement include lenders under the Company's existing first-lien credit agreement or the affiliates of such lenders.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement is subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Debtors anticipate closing the DIP Credit Agreement promptly following final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Motion.\nAutomatic Stay\nSubject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims.\nExecutory Contracts\nSubject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but may give rise to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach.\nChapter 11 Filing Impact on Creditors and Unitholders\nUnder the priority requirements established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities to creditors and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our existing common units are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or plans of reorganization. The outcome of the Chapter 11 cases remain uncertain at this time and, as a result, we cannot accurately estimate the amounts or value of distributions that creditors and unitholders may receive. It is possible that unitholders will receive no distribution on account of their interests. Please read Part I, Item 1, Business for further discussion on plan provisions.\nReorganization Expenses\nThe Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization, principally professional fees. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Chapter 11 Proceedings\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process as described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Because of these risks and uncertainties, the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Form 10-K may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nRecent Developments and Outlook\nHistorically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitcal and economic conditions. During 2015 and through 2016, for example, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices decreased dramatically. The crude oil spot price per barrel during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 ranged from a high of $61.36 to a low of $26.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu during the same period ranged from a high of $3.44 to a low of $1.49. NGLs prices also suffered a similar decline. Commodity prices rallied in late 2016 and as of March 6, 2017, the crude oil spot price per barrel was $53.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu was $2.68. Among the factors causing such volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the ability of the OPEC members to comply with the agreed upon production cuts and the cooperation of other producing countries to reduce\nproduction levels, social unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States and the level and growth of consumer product demand.\nIn addition, the overall decline in commodity prices in recent years has had a negative impact on the price of our common and preferred units. During 2016, our common unit price declined from a high of $3.11 on January 4, 2016 to a low of $0.50 on November 18, 2016. This low commodity price environment has had and will continue to have a direct impact on our revenue, cash flow from operations and Adjusted EBITDA until commodity prices improve. Sustained low prices or any further declines in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, profitability, future growth, borrowing base and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, sustained low prices or any further decline in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically, cause us to delay or postpone our planned capital expenditures and result in further impairments to our oil and natural gas properties. To illustrate the impact of a sustained low commodity price environment, we present the following two examples: (1) if we reduced the 12-month average price for natural gas by $1.00 per MMBtu and if we reduced the 12-month average price for oil by $6.00 per barrel, while production costs remained constant (which has historically not been the case in periods of declining commodity prices and declining production), our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would decrease from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 986.0 Bcfe, based on this price sensitivity generated from an internal evaluation of our proved reserves; and (2) if natural gas prices and oil prices were derived from the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price (using monthly NYMEX settlement prices through December 2022) at March 10, 2017, our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would increase from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 1,483.7 Bcfe. Below is a tabular presentation of the prices depicted in illustration (2) which differ from the SEC 12-month average pricing of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil (held constant):\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2022 (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>$51.93\n</td> <td>$52.10\n</td> <td>$51.76\n</td> <td>$52.14\n</td> <td>$53.12\n</td> <td>$54.34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>$3.20\n</td> <td>$3.04\n</td> <td>$2.88\n</td> <td>$2.84\n</td> <td>$2.84\n</td> <td>$2.85\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Prices for 2022 and subsequent years were not escalated and were held flat for the remaining lives of the properties. Capital and lease operating expenses were also not inflated and held constant for the remaining lives of the properties.\nWhen comparing these settlement prices to the prices of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil used to generate our December 31, 2016 ( 4Q16\u201d) reserve report, the average annual prices for oil and natural gas for each annual year presented above is higher than the 4Q16 reserve report price. The impact of the increase in forward prices to gas wells and oil wells, as compared to the 4Q16 reserve report prices, includes (i) an extension of economic lives (ii) an increase in economically recoverable volumes, and (iii) even if such volumes did not increase, an increase in realized prices. Because the Company's asset mix is 65% natural gas paired with a higher rate increase in natural gas prices when compared to oil (specifically the year 2022 and forward), the hypothetical increase in natural gas reserves was greater than the hypothetical gain of oil and NGLs reserves on an MMcfe basis. The following table compares the 4Q16 reserve report volumes by product with the strip pricing volumes:\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Oil (Bbls)\n</td> <td>Net Gas (MMcf)\n</td> <td>Net NGL (Bbls)\n</td> <td>Net Bcfe\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve Report at 4Q16\n</td> <td>42,293\n</td> <td>888,916\n</td> <td>36,753\n</td> <td>1,363.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 10, 2017 NYMEX Strip Price\n</td> <td>47,346\n</td> <td>963,428\n</td> <td>39,364\n</td> <td>1,483.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Difference\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that the use of the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price may help provide investors with an understanding of the impact of the currently expected commodity price environment to our proved reserves. However, the use of this 5-year NYMEX forward strip price is not necessarily indicative of management's overall outlook on future commodity prices.\nWe recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $494.3 million. Such impairment was recognized during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 and was calculated based on 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas as follows:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impairment Amount (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Natural Gas ($ per MMBtu)\n</td> <td>Oil\n($ per Bbl)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.41\n</td> <td>$46.16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.24\n</td> <td>$42.91\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.29\n</td> <td>$41.48\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.47\n</td> <td>$42.60\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2016 were the reduction in our proved reserves quantities due to the reclassification of our proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources due to uncertainties surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves and the impact of sustained lower commodity prices. Prices have increased thus far in 2017, but still remain volatile. Further impairments of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may occur if commodity prices fall in the future. Potential future impairments are also contingent upon increases or decreases in our reserve base, changes in estimated costs and expenses, and oil and natural gas property acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $252.7 million during the third quarter of 2016 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $253.4 million, as a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions. Any further significant decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as continued declines in the quoted market price of the Company's units could require us to record additional impairment charges during future periods. Although these goodwill impairment charges are of a non-cash nature, they do adversely affect our results of operations in the periods which such charges are recorded.\nWe currently anticipate a capital expenditures budget for 2017 of approximately $150.0 million to $155.0 million, compared to the $64.5 million we spent in 2016. During 2017, we intend to concentrate our drilling on low risk, development opportunities with the majority of drilling capital focused on high Btu natural gas wells in four areas which we believe will continue to offer attractive drilling returns. We expect to spend between $57.0 million to $59.0 million or approximately 38% of the 2017 capital budget in the Green River Basin where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of vertical natural gas wells. Additionally, we expect to spend between $25.0 million to $26.0 million or approximately 17% of the capital budget in the Piceance Basin, at Mamm Creek Field where we will operate a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells. The balance of our capital drilling will be focused in the Gulf Coast Basin at Haynesville Field in Louisiana operating a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells and in the Arkoma Basin operating a one rig program drilling and completing horizontal Woodford wells.\nAs previously disclosed, in May 2016, the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the First Lien Lenders\u201d) decreased the Company's borrowing base from $1.78 billion to $1.325 billion (the Reserve-Based Credit Facility\u201d) resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of approximately $103.5 million. The Company made monthly payments of $17.5 million through September 30, 2016.\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company entered into the Waiver to its Credit Agreement, in which the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any event of default, so long as the payment is made within the 30-day grace period, resulting from the Company's election not to make the approximately $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 3, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020. Pursuant to the Waiver, the First Lien Lenders agreed that the Company's decision to take advantage of the applicable grace period under the indenture governing the Senior Notes due 2020 would not constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Company entered into the Limited Waiver and Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any events of default resulting from the Company's inability to maintain liquidity in excess of $50.0 million, giving pro forma effect to the Company's payments of (i) the $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 1, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 and (ii) the approximately $2.1 million semi-annual interest payment due on December 1, 2016 on approximately $51.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2019.\nIn conjunction with the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements and used the proceeds along with cash on hand first to pre-pay the First Lien Lenders (i) $29.3 million,\nrepresenting the remaining outstanding borrowing base deficiency resulting from the Company's borrowing base redetermination in May 2016 and (ii) $37.5 million, which was applied as the first required monthly payment to the Company's new borrowing base deficiency resulting from the November 2016 borrowing base redetermination discussed below. Also, the Company pledged to the First Lien Lenders certain unencumbered midstream assets as collateral as well as agreed to pay 100% of the net cash proceeds from any asset sale, swap or hedge monetization or other disposition to the First Lien Lenders. The borrowing base may be further reduced as a result of such disposition to the extent of the attributed value of such asset to the borrowing base. Furthermore, any incurrence of second lien debt will require the Company to prepay the First Lien Lenders equal to the net cash proceeds received by the Company from any second lien financing.\nOn November 3, 2016, the Company completed its semi-annual redetermination of its borrowing base, resulting in a reduction from $1.325 billion to $1.1 billion. After consideration of the first $37.5 million deficiency payment already having been made pursuant to entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment on October 26, 2016, the Company was scheduled to repay the remaining borrowing base deficiency of $187.5 million in five equal monthly installments of $37.5 million beginning in January 2017. The Company made the $15.1 million semi-annual interest payment with respect to its Senior Notes due 2020 on October 26, 2016. On January 3, 2017, the Company paid the second $37.5 million deficiency payment installment under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.\nAs discussed above, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on February 1, 2017 described above constitute an event of default that accelerated our indebtedness under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, our Senior Notes due 2019, Senior Notes due 2020 and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the related Credit Agreement and Indentures are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the Petitions and the holders' rights of enforcement in respect of the Credit Agreement and Indentures are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected financial and operating

The decrease in prices was partially offset by an overall increase in oil, natural gas and NGLs volumes primarily attributable to the oil and natural gas properties acquired in the LRE Merger and the Eagle Rock Merger completed during fourth quarter of 2015.\nNatural gas revenues decreased by 10% from $193.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $174.3 million during the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of a $0.20 per Mcf, or 11%, decrease in our average realized natural gas sales price received, excluding hedges. The decrease in average realized natural gas price is primarily due to a lower average NYMEX price, which decreased from $2.64 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2.44 per Mcf during the same period in\n2016. The impact of the decrease in average realized price was partially offset by a 1,492 MMcf increase in our natural gas production volumes attributable to the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers completed during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNGLs revenues increased by 12% in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due a 227 MBbls, or 7%, increase in NGLs production volumes and a $0.62 per Bbl, or 5%, increase in our average realized NGLs sale price received, excluding hedges.\nOil revenues increased by 4% from $164.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $170.0 million during the same period in 2016 as a result of a 652 MBbls, or 16%, increase in oil production volumes in 2016 compared to the prior year principally due to the positive impact of our acquisitions and the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers. The impact of the increase in oil production volumes was partially offset by a $4.47 per Bbl, or 11%, decrease in our average realized oil sales price received, excluding hedges. The decrease in average realized oil price is primarily due to a lower average NYMEX price, which decreased from $47.79 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $42.68 per Bbl during the same period in 2016.\nOverall, our total production increased by 4% on a Mcfe basis for the year ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in 2015. On a Mcfe basis, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs accounted for 18%, 68% and 14%, respectively, of our production during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs of 16%, 70% and 14%, respectively, during the same period in 2015.\nHedging and Price Risk Management Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $44.1 million net loss on commodity derivative contracts. Net cash settlements on matured commodity derivative contracts of $226.9 million and proceeds from monetization of commodity derivative contracts of $54.0 million were received during the period. Our hedging program historically helped mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow. Depending on the type of derivative contract used, hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price. In either case, the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same. However, because our hedges are currently not designated as cash flow hedges, there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts. As commodity prices fluctuate, the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations in the net gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts line item. However, these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity. If the fair value of the derivative contract goes down, it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up, and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same. Conversely, if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up, it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same for the quantities hedged. For additional information on our price risk management activities, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our price risk management activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our cash flow, which may adversely affect our ability to resume distributions to our unitholders.\u201d As of December 31, 2016, we have no commodity derivative contracts in place.\nCosts and Expenses\nLease operating expenses include expenses such as labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies and workover expenses. Lease operating expenses increased by $13.0 million to $159.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $30.4 million is primarily attributable to additional expenses associated with oil and natural gas properties acquired in the LRE Merger and the Eagle Rock Merger. The increase was offset by a $17.4 million decrease in maintenance and repair expenses on existing wells and lower lease operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives including price negotiations with field vendors.\nProduction and other taxes include severance, ad valorem and other taxes. Severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production. Ad valorem taxes vary by state and county and are based on the value of our reserves. Production and other taxes decreased by $1.9 million to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to lower wellhead revenues as a result of the decrease in our average realized oil and natural gas prices. As a percentage of wellhead revenues, production, severance, and ad valorem taxes decreased from 10.2% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion decreased to approximately $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from approximately $247.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a decrease in the depletion base as a result of the non-cash ceiling impairment charges recorded during 2015 and 2016.\nAn impairment of oil and natural gas properties of $494.3 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of a decline in realized oil and natural gas prices at the respective measurement dates of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Such impairment was recognized during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 and calculated using the prices indicated above in Recent Developments and Outlook.\u201d The most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2016 was the reduction in our proved reserves quantities due to the impact of lower commodity prices and uncertainties surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves.\nWe recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $252.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $253.4 million. The fair value amount of the assets and liabilities were calculated using a combination of a market and income approach as follows: equity, debt and certain oil and gas properties were valued using a market approach while the remaining balance sheet assets and liabilities were valued using an income approach. Furthermore, significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties include: (i) observable forward prices for commodities at December 31, 2016 and (ii) a 10% discount rate, which was comparable to discount rates on recent transactions. Based on our evaluation of qualitative factors, we determined that the goodwill impairment is primarily a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions and the decline in the market price of our common units.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of our employees, related benefits, office leases, professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $4.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily resulting from approximately $13.6 million related to the hiring of additional employees, higher office expenses and professional services related to the LRE Merger and the Eagle Rock Merger completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, $3.2 million in pre-petition restructuring costs, $2.3 million in transaction fees incurred on divestitures and a $3.0 million increase in our bad debt provision on uncollectible accounts. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of about $11.3 million recognized in 2015 for the severance costs paid to former Eagle Rock executives and employees who were terminated subsequent to the Eagle Rock Merger, $3.2 million in Texas franchise tax and federal tax provision attributed to the increase in the deferred tax asset and decrease in the deferred tax liability associated with our oil and natural gas properties and a $2.9 million increase in COPAS overhead income attributed to the increase in operated wells acquired through the LRE Merger and the Eagle Rock Merger completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $8.3 million to $10.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to the accelerated vesting of LTIP grants issued to former Eagle Rock executives and employees that are attributable to post merger services amounting to $7.3 million during 2015. In addition, during 2015, our board of directors approved the option for Vanguard's management team to receive Vanguard common units in lieu of their 2015 cash compensation. Messrs. Smith and Robert and our three independent directors, Loren B. Singletary, W. Richard Anderson and Bruce W. McCullough elected this option and under the plan received quarterly grants of Vanguard common units instead of their 2015 cash compensation, resulting in higher non-cash compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense increased to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility and higher interest rates in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt amounting to $89.7 million which represents the difference between the aggregate fair market value the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes issued and the net carrying amount of Senior Notes due 2020 that were part of the Debt Exchange entered into in February 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Vanguard made adjustments to the amounts assigned to the net assets acquired related to the Eagle Rock Merger based on new information obtained about facts that existed as of the merger date. As a result, the bargain purchase gain was reduced by $5.0 million. This adjustment is included in the net loss on acquisition of oil and natural gas properties for this period.\nIn accordance with the guidance contained within ASC Topic 805, the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions completed during 2015 compared to the fair value of consideration transferred, adjusted for purchase price adjustments, resulted in a gain of $40.8 million and goodwill of $156.8 million, of which $0.3 million was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss, resulting in a net gain of $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net gains and losses resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves between the commitment and close dates and have been recognized in current period earnings and classified in other income and expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nOil, natural gas and NGLs sales increased by $227.4 million, or 36%, to $397.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.

The decrease in average realized oil price is primarily due to a lower average NYMEX price, which decreased from $92.21 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $47.79 per Bbl during the same period in 2015. The impact of the\ndecrease in average realized price was partially offset by a 707 MBbls increase in oil production volumes in 2015 compared to the prior year principally due to the positive impact of our acquisitions and the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers.\nNatural gas revenues decreased by 32% from $285.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $193.5 million during the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of a $1.63 per Mcf, or 47%, decrease in our average realized natural gas sales price received, excluding hedges. The decrease in average realized natural gas price is primarily due to a lower average NYMEX price, which decreased from $4.39 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.64 per Mcf during the same period in 2015. The impact of the decrease in average realized price was partially offset by a 23,578 MMcf increase in our natural gas production volumes attributable to the impact from our acquisitions in the Piceance and Gulf Coast Basins completed during the third quarter of 2014 wherein we realized the benefit of a full year of production in 2015 and the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNGLs revenues also decreased by 44% in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to a $14.20 per Bbl, or 56%, decrease in our average realized NGLs sale price received, excluding hedges, offset by a 730 MBbls increase in NGLs production volumes due to the positive impact of our acquisitions and the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers.\nOverall, our total production increased by 27% on a Mcfe basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the comparable period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact from our acquisitions completed at the end of the third quarter in 2014 wherein we realized the benefit of a full year of production in 2015 as well as from our LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers whereby we experienced the benefit of their operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. On a Mcfe basis, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs accounted for 16%, 70% and 14%, respectively, of our production during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nHedging and Price Risk Management Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $169.4 million net gain on commodity derivative contracts. Net cash settlements on matured commodity derivative contracts of $211.7 million were received during the period. Our hedging program is intended to help mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow. Depending on the type of derivative contract used, hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price. In either case, the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same. However, because our hedges are currently not designated as cash flow hedges, there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts. As commodity prices fluctuate, the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations in the net gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts line item. However, these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity. If the fair value of the derivative contract goes down, it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up, and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same. Conversely, if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up, it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same for the quantities hedged. For additional information on our price risk management activities, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors- Our price risk management activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our cash flow, which may adversely affect our ability to resume distributions to our unitholders.\u201d\nCosts and Expenses\nLease operating expenses include expenses such as labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies and workover expenses. Lease operating expenses increased by $14.1 million to $146.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $30.9 million was related to increased lease operating expenses for oil and natural gas properties acquired in 2015 and 2014. The increase was offset by a $16.8 million decrease in maintenance and repair expenses on existing wells and lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives, including price negotiations with field vendors.\nProduction and other taxes include severance, ad valorem and other taxes. Severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production. Ad valorem taxes vary by state and county and are based on the value of our reserves. Production and other taxes decreased by $21.3 million to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower wellhead revenues as a result of the decrease in our average realized sales prices received for oil, natural gas and NGLs. As a percentage of wellhead revenues, production, severance, and ad valorem taxes increased from 9.9% during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014 to 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher tax rates on properties acquired during 2014 in the states of Wyoming, Colorado, Louisiana and Texas.\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion increased to approximately $247.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from approximately $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a higher depletion base associated with properties acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nAn impairment of oil and natural gas properties of $1.8 billion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of a decline in realized oil and natural gas prices at the respective measurement dates of March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. Such impairment was recognized during each quarter of 2015 and calculated using the prices indicated above in Recent Developments and Outlook.\u201d The most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2015 were declining oil and natural gas prices and the closing of the LRE Merger and Eagle Rock Merger. The fair value of the properties acquired (determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves on the acquisitions dates) was higher than the discounted estimated future cash flows computed using the 12-month average prices on the impairment test measurement dates. However, the impairment calculations did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions because generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.\nWe recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $506.0 million. The fair value amount of the assets and liabilities were calculated using a combination of a market and income approach as follows: equity, debt and certain oil and natural gas properties were valued using a market approach while the remaining balance sheet assets and liabilities were valued using an income approach. Furthermore, significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value of our oil and gas properties include: (i) observable forward prices for commodities at December 31, 2015 and (ii) a 10% discount rate, which was comparable to discount rates on recent transactions. Based on evaluation of qualitative factors, we determined that the goodwill impairment is primarily a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions and the decline in the market price of our common units.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of our employees, related benefits, office leases, professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations. These expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $17.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily resulting from the recognition of severance costs paid to former Eagle Rock executives and employees who were terminated subsequent to the Eagle Rock Merger amounting to $11.3 million, an increase of about $3.6 million resulting from the hiring of additional employees and higher office expenses related to our acquisitions and the change in the accrual of employee bonuses for the 2015 performance year discussed below of about $2.5 million. Non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.8 million to $18.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to the costs related to the accelerated vesting of LTIP grants issued to former Eagle Rock executives and employees that are attributable to post merger services amounting to $7.3 million. In addition, our board of directors approved the option for Vanguard's management team to receive Vanguard common units in lieu of their 2015 cash compensation. Messrs. Smith and Robert and our three independent directors, Loren B. Singletary, W. Richard Anderson and Bruce W. McCullough elected this option and under the plan received quarterly grants of Vanguard common units instead of their 2015 cash compensation. This increase in non-cash compensation was offset by the fact that a large portion of the 2015 employee bonuses were paid in cash rather than in Vanguard common units amounted to approximately $2.5 million compared to 2014.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense increased to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $69.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nIn accordance with the guidance contained within ASC Topic 805, the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions completed during 2015 compared to the fair value of consideration transferred, adjusted for purchase price adjustments, resulted in a gain of $40.8 million and goodwill of $156.8 million, of which $0.3 million was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss, resulting in a net gain of $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The comparable measurement for the acquisitions completed during 2014 resulted in a gain of $34.9 million and goodwill of $0.4 million, which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss, resulting in a net gain of $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net gains and losses resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves between the commitment and close dates and have been recognized in current period earnings and classified in other income and expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.\nBelow, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Please read Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nFull-Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nThe accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for gas and oil business activities: the successful-efforts method and the full-cost method. There are several significant differences between these methods. Under the successful-efforts method, costs such as geological and geophysical, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the full-cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to the full-cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of proved gas and oil properties, the successful-efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment,\u201d where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full-cost method, the net book value (full-cost pool) is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at 10% using commodity prices based upon the 12-month average price (ceiling limitation). If the full-cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount is charged as an expense.\nWe have elected to use the full-cost method to account for our investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, we capitalize all acquisition, exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly related to these finding activities. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no internal costs capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Our results of operations would have been different had we used the successful-efforts method for our oil and natural gas investments. Generally, the application of the full-cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to similar companies applying the successful-efforts method of accounting.\nFull-Cost Ceiling Test\nAt the end of each quarterly reporting period, the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using oil and natural gas prices based upon the 12-month average prices, after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions, for which hedge accounting is applied, discounted at 10% and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties (the ceiling test\u201d). Our hedges were not considered cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, and thus the value of our hedges were not considered in our ceiling test calculations. In addition, we do not include proved undeveloped reserves that were dropped from our drilling program in our ceiling test calculations. The SEC's Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting,\u201d requires that the present value of future net revenue from proved properties be calculated based upon the 12-month average price.\nThe calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production, timing, and plan of development as more fully discussed in -Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Reserve Quantities\u201d below. Due to the imprecision in estimating oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as well as the potential volatility in oil, natural gas\nand NGLs prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves, there can be no assurance that additional Ceiling Test write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas properties. These factors include declining oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, downward revisions in estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities.\nWe recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $494.3 million. Such impairment was recognized during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 and was calculated based on 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas as follows:\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impairment Amount (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Natural Gas ($ per MMBtu)\n</td> <td>Oil\n($ per Bbl)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.41\n</td> <td>$46.16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.24\n</td> <td>$42.91\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.29\n</td> <td>$41.48\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.47\n</td> <td>$42.60\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2016 were the reduction in our proved reserves quantities due to the reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources due to uncertainties surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves and the impact of sustained lower commodity prices.\nWe also recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.8 billion as a result of a decline in realized oil and natural gas prices at the respective measurement dates of March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. Such impairment was recognized during each quarter of 2015 and was calculated based on 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas as follows:\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impairment Amount (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Natural Gas ($ per MMBtu)\n</td> <td>Oil\n($ per Bbl)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.91\n</td> <td>$82.62\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>733,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.44\n</td> <td>$71.51\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.11\n</td> <td>$59.23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.62\n</td> <td>$50.20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,842,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2015 were declining oil and natural gas prices and the closing of the LRE Merger and Eagle Rock Merger. The fair value of the properties acquired (determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves on the acquisition dates) was higher than the discounted estimated future cash flows computed using the 12-month average prices on the impairment test measurement dates. However, the impairment calculations did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions because generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.\nWe also recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $234.4 million as a result of a decline in realized oil and natural gas prices at the measurement date of December 31, 2014. Such impairment was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2014. The most significant factor affecting the 2014 impairment related to the fair value of the properties that we acquired in the Piceance Acquisition. The fair value of the properties acquired (determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves at the acquisition date) was higher than the discounted estimated future cash flows computed using the 12-month average prices at the impairment test measurement dates. However, the impairment calculations did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The fourth quarter 2014 impairment was calculated based on prices of $4.36 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.87 per barrel of crude oil.\nIn accordance with the guidance contained within ASC Topic 805, upon the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, the company records an asset based on the measurement of the fair value of the properties acquired determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves at the acquisitions dates, which can have several price increases over the entire reserve life. As discussed\nabove, capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of future net revenues, computed using a flat price for the entire reserve life equal to the historical 12-month average price, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If the ceiling is less than the total capitalized costs, we are required to write down capitalized costs to the ceiling. As a result, there is a risk that we will be required to record an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties if certain attributes exist, such as declining oil and natural gas prices. Prices have increased thus far in 2017, but still remain volatile. Further impairments of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may occur if commodity prices fall in the future. Potential future impairments are also contingent upon increases or decreases in our reserve base, changes in estimated costs and expenses, and oil and natural gas property acquisitions or divestitures.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under ASC Topic 805. We recognize and measure in our financial statements the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and any goodwill acquired in all transactions in which control of one or more businesses is obtained.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\u201d Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever indicators of impairment exist using a two-step process.\nThe goodwill test is performed at the reporting unit level, which represents our oil and natural gas operations in the United States. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value, which is its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using the market approach based on our quoted common unit price. Quoted prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value. However, because value results from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that exist from a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity, the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole. Accordingly, we add a control premium to the market price to determine the total fair value of our reporting unit, derived from marketplace data of actual control premiums in the oil and natural gas extraction industry. The sum of our market capitalization and control premium is the fair value of our reporting unit. This amount is then compared to the carrying value of our reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.\nIf the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In addition, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative, the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, when it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In considering whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity shall evaluate any adverse qualitative factors. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nDetermining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about market prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities, such as a business. As described above, the key inputs used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit are our common unit price, number of common units outstanding and a control premium. There is no uncertainty associated with our common unit price and number of common units outstanding. The control premium is based on market data of actual control premiums in our industry. Changes in the common unit price, which could result from further significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas or significant negative reserve adjustments, or changes in market data as it relates to control premiums in the oil and gas extraction industry could change our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit and could result in a non-cash impairment charge.\nWe performed our annual impairment tests during 2016, 2015 and 2014 and our analyses concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of these dates. However, due to the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating\nmarket conditions, we performed interim impairment tests at each quarter-end, commencing with the quarter-ended December 31, 2014. At each measurement date, if the Company was required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the fair value amount of the assets and liabilities were calculated using a combination of a market and income approach as follows: equity, debt and certain oil and gas properties were valued using a market approach while the remaining balance sheet assets and liabilities were valued using an income approach. Furthermore, significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value of our oil and gas properties included: (i) observable forward prices for commodities at the respective measurement date and (ii) a 10% discount rate, which was comparable to discount rates on recent transactions.\nAt the respective measurement dates of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our reporting unit was negative. Therefore the Company was required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test at these interim dates. Based on the results of the the second step of the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $252.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $253.4 million. Based on our estimates, the implied fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 15%, 3%, and 14% at the respective measurement dates of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Therefore no additional impairment loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. Based on evaluation of qualitative factors, we determined that the goodwill impairment was primarily a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions and the decline in the market price of our common units.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our reporting unit was negative. Therefore the Company was required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $506.0 million. Based on evaluation of qualitative factors, we determined that the goodwill impairment was primarily a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions and the decline in the market price of our common units.\nBased on our estimates, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 8% at December 31, 2014 and therefore the second step of the impairment test was not necessary. We believe this difference between the fair value and the net book value was appropriate (in the context of assessing whether a goodwill impairment may exist) when a market-based control premium was taken into account and in light of the recent volatility in the equity markets.\nAny further significant decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as any continued declines in the quoted market price of the Company's units could require us to record additional impairment charges during future periods. Although these goodwill impairment charges are of a non-cash nature, they do adversely affect our results of operations in the periods which such charges are recorded.\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with definite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for the acquisition of a business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values of those assets and liabilities. Estimates of fair value are based upon, among other things, reserve estimates, anticipated future prices and costs, and expected net cash flows to be generated. These estimates are often highly subjective and may have a material impact on the amounts recorded for acquired assets and liabilities.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe have obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of an oil or natural gas well's life. Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and the decommissioning of our Elk Basin, Big Escambia Creek and Fairway gas plants. Estimating the future plugging and abandonment costs requires management to make estimates and judgments inherent in the present value calculation of the future obligation. These include ultimate plugging and abandonment costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, and timing of the obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.\nOil, Natural Gas and NGLs Reserve Quantities\nOur reservoir engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves accordance with SEC regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. Proved oil and gas reserves are\ndefined by the SEC as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although our reservoir engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation and depletion rates used by us. We cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. As of December 31, 2016, we have removed all proved undeveloped reserves from our total proved reserve estimate due to uncertainties regarding the availability of capital that would be required to develop these reserves.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are recognized when oil, natural gas and NGLs have been delivered to a custody transfer point, persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery, collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured, and the sales price is fixed or determinable. We sell oil, natural gas and NGLs on a monthly basis. Virtually all of our contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of the oil or natural gas, and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that the price of the oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil, natural gas and NGLs supplies. As a result, our revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs will suffer if market prices decline and benefit if they increase without consideration of hedging. We believe that the pricing provisions of our oil, natural gas and NGLs contracts are customary in the industry. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded.\nThe Company has elected the entitlements method to account for gas production imbalances. Gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total gas production. Any amount received in excess of our share is treated as a liability. If we receive less than our entitled share the underproduction is recorded as a receivable. We did not have any significant gas imbalance positions at December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nPrice Risk Management Activities\nHistorically, we used derivative financial instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from our oil and natural gas production by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations. We primarily entered into fixed-price swaps, basis swap contracts and other hedge option contracts to hedge oil and natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2016, we had no commodity derivative contracts in place.\nUnder ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d ( ASC Topic 815\u201d), the fair value of hedge contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or liability, and since we do not apply hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedge contracts are reflected in earnings. If the hedge contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the fair value of the hedge contract is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income,\u201d and changes in the fair value do not affect net income until the contract is settled. If the hedge contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the change in the fair value of the hedge contract is reflected in earnings during the period as gain or loss on commodity derivatives. We currently do not have any hedge arrangements in place.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for stock based compensation pursuant to ASC Topic 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC Topic 718\u201d). ASC Topic 718 requires an entity to recognize the estimated grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees in the income statement. It establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for generally all share-based payment transactions with employees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease read Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a detailed list of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOverview\nHistorically, we have obtained financing through proceeds from bank borrowings, cash flow from operations and from the public equity and debt markets to provide us with the capital resources and liquidity necessary to operate our business. To date, the primary use of capital has been for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. Our future success in growing reserves, production and cash flow will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us and our success in drilling for and acquiring additional reserves.\nLiquidity After Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code\nSubject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions. Thus, for example, most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the Debtors' property, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are enjoined unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay.\nThe Bankruptcy Court has approved payment of certain pre-petition obligations, including payments for employee wages, salaries and certain other benefits, customer programs, taxes, utilities, insurance, surety bond premiums as well as payments to critical vendors and possessory lien vendors. Despite the liquidity provided by our existing cash on hand, our ability to maintain normal credit terms with our suppliers may become impaired. We may be required to pay cash in advance to certain vendors and may experience restrictions on the availability of trade credit, which would further reduce our liquidity. If liquidity problems persist, our suppliers could refuse to provide key products and services in the future. In addition, due to the public perception of our financial condition and results of operations, in particular with regard to our potential failure to meet our debt obligations, some vendors could be reluctant to enter into long-term agreements with us.\nIn addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity, including approximately $50.0 million of cash on hand as of December 31, 2016 and funds generated from ongoing operations, to fund anticipated cash requirements through the Chapter 11 proceedings for minimum operating and capital expenditures and for working capital purposes and excluding principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. As such, the Company expects to pay vendor, royalty and surety obligations on a go-forward basis according to the terms of our current contracts and consistent with applicable court orders approving such payments.\nHowever, given the current level of volatility in the market and the unpredictability of certain costs that could potentially arise in our operations, our liquidity needs could be significantly higher than we currently anticipate and therefore the Debtors have filed a motion to enter into a DIP Credit Agreement as described below to provide additional liquidity. There are no assurances that our current liquidity is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases, allow us to proceed with the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and allow us to emerge from bankruptcy. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs or, if sufficient funds are available, offered to us on acceptable terms.\nDebtor-in-Possession Financing\nIn connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion (the DIP Motion\u201d) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the Debtors' use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d) among VNG (the DIP Borrower\u201d), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the DIP Agent\u201d) and as issuing bank. The initial lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement include lenders under the Company's existing first-lien credit agreement or the affiliates of such lenders. The proposed DIP Credit Agreement, if approved by the Bankruptcy Court, contains the following terms:\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million, and $15.0 million available on an interim basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>proceeds of the DIP Credit Agreement may be used by the DIP Borrower to (i) pay certain costs and expenses related to the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) make payments provided for in the DIP Motion, including in respect of certain adequate protection\u201d obligations and (iii) fund working capital needs, capital improvements and other general corporate purposes of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, in all cases subject to the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the maturity date of the DIP Credit Agreement is expected to be the earliest to occur of November 1, 2017, forty-five days following the date of the interim order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Facility on an interim basis, if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the final order on or prior to such date, or the effective date of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases.

The Debtors anticipate closing the DIP Credit Agreement promptly following final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Motion.\nThe following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in each of the most recent three years:\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(128.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,446.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(447.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(241.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow from Operations\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $290.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $370.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and compared to $339.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, changes in working capital decreased total cash flows by $40.0 million. Contributing to the decrease in working capital during 2016 was a $59.5 million decrease in accounts payable and oil and natural\ngas revenue payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities that resulted primarily from the timing effects of invoice payments and offset by a $9.6 million decrease in accounts receivable related to the timing of receipts from production.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, changes in working capital increased cash flows by $18.9 million. Contributing to the increase in working capital during 2015 was a $53.4 million decrease in accounts receivable related to the timing of receipts from production from the acquisitions, offset by a $43.9 million decrease in accounts payable and oil and natural gas revenue payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities that resulted primarily from the timing effects of invoice payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, changes in working capital resulted in a $10.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities due to a $69.9 million increase in accounts receivable related to the timing of receipts from production from the acquisitions, offset by a $51.5 million increase in accounts payable and oil and natural gas revenue payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities that resulted primarily from the timing effects of invoice payments.\nThe change in the fair value of our derivative contracts are non-cash items and therefore did not impact our liquidity or cash flows provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur cash flow from operations is subject to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGLs prices. Oil, natural gas and NGLs prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions, which are dependent on regional and worldwide economic and political activity, weather and other factors beyond our control. Future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to maintain and increase production through our drilling program and acquisitions, as well as the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs. We entered into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on operations. During 2016, we primarily used fixed-price swaps, basis swap contracts and other hedge option contracts to hedge oil and natural gas prices. However, unlike natural gas, we are unable to hedge oil price differentials in certain operating areas which could significantly impact our cash flow from operations.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities was approximately $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to cash used of $128.1 million during 2015, and compared to cash used of $1.4 billion during 2014.\nCash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily included $298.7 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain oil and natural gas properties. Also during the year, cash used in investing activities included $64.5 million for the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties, $19.7 million for deposits and prepayments related to the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties and $7.5 million for the acquisition of a 51% joint venture interest in the Potato Hills Gas Gathering System.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we used cash of $112.6 million for the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties, $22.2 million for deposits and prepayments related to the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties, $13.0 million for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and $0.6 million for property and equipment additions. Also during the year, we received $18.5 million in cash when we closed the LRE and Eagle Rock Mergers and $1.8 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain oil and natural gas properties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we used cash of $1.3 billion for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, $142.0 million for the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties, and $5.2 million for deposits and prepayments related to the drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties and $1.4 million for property and equipment additions.\nAlso during the year, we received $5.0 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain oil and natural gas properties and leases.\nExcluding any potential acquisitions, we currently anticipate a capital expenditures budget for 2017 of approximately $150.0 million to $155.0 million. Our expected capital spending will largely include drilling and completion in the Green River Basin participating as a non-operating partner in the development drilling of directional natural gas wells in the Pinedale Field. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations, expected dispositions of oil and natural gas properties or asset sales as allowed under our credit agreements will exceed our planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was approximately $447.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to cash used of $241.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and compared to cash provided of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included cash of $517.2 million that was used in the repayments of our Reserve-Based Credit Facility and $4.2 million was paid for financing. We also paid distributions of $11.9 million to our common and Class B unitholders and $6.7 million to our preferred unitholders. Additionally, we received net proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt of $93.5 million.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 included cash of $508.6 million that was used in the repayments of our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, $2.4 million was used for the repurchase of common units under the buyback program and $12.1 million was paid for financing costs and offering costs. We also paid $147.6 million in distributions to our common and Class B unitholders and $26.8 million in distributions to our preferred unitholders. Additionally, we received net proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt of $420.0 million and net proceeds from our common unit offerings of $35.5 million.\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 included net proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt of $1.4 billion, net proceeds from our preferred unit offerings of $274.4 million and net proceeds from our common unit offerings of $147.8 million. Additionally, cash of $488.0 million was used in the repayments of our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, $2.5 million was used for the repurchase of common units under the buyback program and $1.2 million was paid for financing costs. We also paid $206.6 million in distributions to our common and Class B unitholders and $17.3 million in distributions to our preferred unitholders.\nShelf Registration Statements\nPrior to the entry into the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company had an effective universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-210329), filed with the SEC, under which the Company registered an indeterminate amount of common units, Preferred Units, debt securities and guarantees of debt securities. The Company also had on file with the SEC a post-effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-207357), under which the Company registered up to 14,593,606 common units. The Company is no longer eligible to offer or sell any of its securities pursuant to the shelf registration statements on Form S-3.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nAcceleration of Debt Obligations\nAs previously discussed, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on February 1, 2017 constitutes an event of default that accelerated our indebtedness under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, our Senior Notes due 2019, Senior Notes due 2020 and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes, all of which we describe in further detail below. Accordingly, all amounts due under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, Second Lien Secured Notes, Senior Notes due 2020 and Senior Notes 2019 are classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the respective Credit Agreement and Indentures are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the Petitions and the holders' rights of enforcement in respect of the Credit Agreement and Indentures are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nSenior Secured Reserve-Based Credit Facility\nThe Company's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) provided a maximum credit facility of $3.5 billion and a borrowing base of $1.1 billion (the Reserve-Based Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2016 there were approximately $1.27 billion of outstanding borrowings and approximately $0.2 million in outstanding letters of credit resulting in a borrowing deficiency of $169.2 million under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.\nIn May 2016, the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the First Lien Lenders\u201d) decreased the Company's borrowing base from $1.78 billion to $1.325 billion resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of approximately $103.5 million. The Company made monthly payments of $17.5 million through September 30, 2016.\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a waiver (the Waiver\u201d) to its Credit Agreement, in which the First Lien Lenders thereto agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any event of default, so long as the payment was made within the 30-day grace period, resulting from the Company's election not to make the approximately $15.0 million\nsemi-annual interest payment due on October 3, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 (defined below). Pursuant to the Waiver, the First Lien Lenders agreed that the Company's decision to take advantage of the applicable grace period under the indenture governing the Senior Notes due 2020 did not constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. A failure to pay interest on the Senior Notes due 2020 following the expiration of the 30-day grace period would have resulted in events of default under the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes (defined below), which would have entitled the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and the First Lien Lenders to declare all obligations thereunder to be immediately due and payable. The Company made the $15.1 million semi-annual interest payment with respect to its Senior Notes due 2020 on October 26, 2016.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Company entered into the Limited Waiver and Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any events of default resulting from the Company's inability to maintain liquidity in excess of $50.0 million, giving pro forma effect to the Company's payments of (i) the $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 1, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 and (ii) the approximately $2.1 million semi-annual interest payment due on December 1, 2016 on approximately $51.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2019.\nIn conjunction with the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements and used the proceeds along with cash on hand first to pre-pay the First Lien Lenders (i) $29.3 million, representing the remaining outstanding borrowing base deficiency resulting from the Company's borrowing base redetermination in May 2016 and (ii) $37.5 million, which was applied as the first required monthly payment to the Company's new borrowing base deficiency resulting from the November 2016 borrowing base redetermination discussed below. Also, the Company pledged to the First Lien Lenders certain unencumbered midstream assets as collateral as well as agreed to pay 100% of the net cash proceeds from any asset sale, swap or hedge monetization or other disposition to the First Lien Lenders. The borrowing base may be further reduced as a result of such disposition to the extent of the attributed value of such asset to the borrowing base. Furthermore, any incurrence of second lien debt will require the Company to prepay the First Lien Lenders equal to the net cash proceeds received by the Company from any second lien financing.\nOn November 3, 2016, the Company completed its semi-annual redetermination of its borrowing base, resulting in a reduction from $1.325 billion to $1.1 billion. After consideration of the first $37.5 million deficiency payment already having been made pursuant to entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment on October 26, 2016, the Company was scheduled to repay the remaining borrowing base deficiency of $187.5 million in five equal monthly installments of $37.5 million beginning in January 2017. On January 3, 2017, the Company paid the second $37.5 million deficiency payment installment under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2016, we had unused irrevocable standby letters of credit of approximately $0.2 million. The letters are being maintained as security related to the issuance of oil and gas well permits to recover potential costs of repairs, modification, or construction to remedy damages to properties caused by the operator. Borrowing availability for the letters of credit is provided under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility. The fair value of these letters of credit approximates contract values based on the nature of the fee arrangements with the issuing banks.\n8.375% Senior Notes Due 2019\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $51.1 million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due in 2019 (the Senior Notes due 2019\u201d). The Senior Notes due 2019 were assumed by VO in connection with the Eagle Rock Merger. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2019 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Senior Notes due 2019 are fully and unconditionally (except for customary release provisions) and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Vanguard and all of our existing subsidiaries, all of which are 100% owned, and certain of our future subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d). Prior to the Eagle Rock Merger, the parties to the indenture executed a supplemental indenture which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default with respect to the Senior Notes due 2019.\n7.875% Senior Notes Due 2020\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $381.8 million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior notes due in 2020 (the Senior Notes Due 2020\u201d). The issuers of the Senior Notes due 2020 are VNR and our 100% owned finance\nsubsidiary, VNRF. VNR has no independent assets or operations.\n7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes Due 2023\nOn February 10, 2016, we issued approximately $75.6 million aggregate principal amount of new 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes\u201d) to certain eligible holders of their outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 in exchange for approximately $168.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2020 held by such holders.\nThe exchanges were accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. As a result, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $89.7 million for year ended December 31, 2016, which is the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes issued and the carrying amount of Senior Notes due 2020 extinguished in the exchange, net of unamortized bond discount and deferred financing costs, of $165.3 million.\nLease Financing Obligations\nOn October 24, 2014, as part of our Piceance Acquisition, we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC as the lead bank, whereby we acquired compressors and the related facilities, and assumed the related financing obligations (the Lease Financing Obligations\u201d). Certain rights, title, interest and obligations under the Lease Financing Obligations have been assigned to several lenders and are covered by separate assignment agreements, which expire on August 10, 2020 and July 10, 2021. We have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for the then current fair market value. The Lease Financing Obligations also contain an early buyout option where the Company may purchase the equipment for $16.0 million on February 10, 2019. The lease payments related to the equipment are recognized as principal and interest expense based on a weighted average implicit interest rate of 4.16%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no guarantees or off-balance sheet debt to third parties, and we maintain no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings.\nContingencies\nThe Company regularly analyzes current information and accrues for probable liabilities on the disposition of certain matters, as necessary. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2016, there were no material loss contingencies.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 is provided in the following table:\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Year (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management base salaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve-Based Credit Facility (2)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes and related interest (3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development commitments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm transportation and processing agreements (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Financing Obligations (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other future obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,872,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,188,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the discounted future plugging and abandonment costs of oil and natural gas wells and decommissioning of our Elk Basin, Big Escambia Creek and Fairway gas plants.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, forecasts, guidance, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for natural gas, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A . Risk Factors\u201d and Forward Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to resume making monthly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, increase our monthly cash distributions through the acquisition of additional mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2016, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in ten operating basins:\n \u2022 the Green River Basin in Wyoming; \n \u2022 the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico; \n \u2022 the Piceance Basin in Colorado; \n \u2022 the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama; \n \u2022 the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma; \n \u2022 the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana; \n \u2022 the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana; \n \u2022 the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas; \n \u2022 the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and \n \u2022 the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. \nAt December 31, 2016, we owned working interests in 12,589 gross (4,444 net) productive wells. In addition to these productive wells, we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells. We own working interests in approximately 677,509 gross undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells.\nThe rapid and substantial decline in oil and gas prices for an extended period of time since mid-2014 through the early part of 2016 have negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows. Further, these sustained low oil and natural gas prices have had a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases described below, we took the steps described below to provide significant incremental cash flow, to allow us to meaningfully reduce our leverage over the course of 2016 and to provide sufficient liquidity to manage the expected reductions to the borrowing base in our Reserve-Based Credit Facility:\n \u2022 We significantly reduced our capital expenditures to $64.5 million in 2016 as compared to the $112.6 million spent in 2015. \n \u2022 On February 10, 2016, we issued approximately $75.6 million aggregate principal amount of new 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 in exchange for approximately $168.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2020 held by such holders. The \nSenior Secured Second Lien Notes were issued pursuant to an exchange offer. The Senior Secured Second Lien Notes will mature on (i) February 15, 2023 or (ii) December 31, 2019 if, prior to December 31, 2019, we have not repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid in full all of the Senior Notes due 2020 outstanding at that time in excess of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount and, to the extent we have repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid the Senior Notes due 2020 with proceeds of certain indebtedness, if such indebtedness has a final maturity date no earlier than the date that is 91 days after February 15, 2023. This reduction in outstanding Senior Notes due 2020 reduced our interest expense by $7.9 million on an annual basis. Under our Credit Agreement, the issuance of new second lien debt requires, among other things, that our borrowing base decrease by 25% of the amount of new second lien debt. Because of this, in February 2016, the $1.8 billion borrowing base decreased by $18.9 million to $1.78 billion.\n \u2022 On February 25, 2016, our board of directors elected to suspend our monthly cash distribution on our common, Class B and Preferred Units effective with the February 2016 distribution. \n \u2022 On May 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids assets in the SCOOP/STACK area in Oklahoma to entities managed by Titanium Exploration Partners, LLC for $270.5 million (the SCOOP/STACK Divestiture\u201d). The Company used $268.4 million of the cash received to reduce borrowings under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility and $2.1 million to pay for some of the transaction fees related to the sale. We also completed sales of certain of our other properties in several different counties within our operating areas for an aggregate consideration of approximately $28.2 million. \n \u2022 In October 2016, in conjunction with entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment (defined in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements for total proceeds of approximately $42.3 million. Subsequently on December 19, 2016, Company completed a monetization of substantially all of its commodity and interest rate hedges with net proceeds totaling $11.7 million. \nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nChapter 11 Proceedings\nOn February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, we will continue to operate our business as debtors in possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nRestructuring Support Agreement\nPrior to the filing of the Petitions, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement\u201d) with (i) certain holders (the Consenting 2020 Noteholders\u201d) constituting approximately 52% of the 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes due 2020\u201d); (ii) certain holders (the Consenting 2019 Noteholders and, together with the Consenting 2020 Noteholders, the Consenting Senior Noteholders) constituting approximately 10% of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes due 2019,\u201d and all claims arising under or in connection with the Senior Notes due 2020 and Senior Notes due 2019, the Senior Note Claims\u201d); and (iii) certain holders (the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders\u201d and, together with the Consenting Senior Noteholders, the Restructuring Support Parties\u201d) constituting approximately 92% of the 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the Second Lien Notes,\u201d and all claims and obligations arising under or in connection with the Second Lien Notes, the Second Lien Note Claims\u201d).\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment of the Debtors and the Restructuring Support Parties to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Debtors' long-term debt (the Restructuring Transactions\u201d). The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through one or more plans of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) to be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Restructuring Transactions will be financed by (i) use of cash collateral, (ii) the proposed DIP Credit Agreement (as described below, (iii) a fully committed $19.25 million equity investment (the Second Lien Investment\u201d) by the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders and (iv) a $255.75 million rights offering (the Senior Note Rights Offering\u201d) that is fully backstopped by the Consenting Senior Noteholders.\nDebtor-in-Possession Financing\nIn connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion (the DIP Motion\u201d) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the Debtors' use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d) among VNG (the DIP Borrower\u201d), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the DIP Agent\u201d) and as issuing bank. The initial lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement include lenders under the Company's existing first-lien credit agreement or the affiliates of such lenders.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement is subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Debtors anticipate closing the DIP Credit Agreement promptly following final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Motion.\nAutomatic Stay\nSubject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims.\nExecutory Contracts\nSubject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but may give rise to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach.\nChapter 11 Filing Impact on Creditors and Unitholders\nUnder the priority requirements established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities to creditors and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our existing common units are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or plans of reorganization. The outcome of the Chapter 11 cases remain uncertain at this time and, as a result, we cannot accurately estimate the amounts or value of distributions that creditors and unitholders may receive. It is possible that unitholders will receive no distribution on account of their interests. Please read Part I, Item 1, Business for further discussion on plan provisions.\nReorganization Expenses\nThe Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization, principally professional fees. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Chapter 11 Proceedings\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process as described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Because of these risks and uncertainties, the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Form 10-K may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nRecent Developments and Outlook\nHistorically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitcal and economic conditions. During 2015 and through 2016, for example, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices decreased dramatically. The crude oil spot price per barrel during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 ranged from a high of $61.36 to a low of $26.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu during the same period ranged from a high of $3.44 to a low of $1.49. NGLs prices also suffered a similar decline. Commodity prices rallied in late 2016 and as of March 6, 2017, the crude oil spot price per barrel was $53.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu was $2.68. Among the factors causing such volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the ability of the OPEC members to comply with the agreed upon production cuts and the cooperation of other producing countries to reduce\nproduction levels, social unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States and the level and growth of consumer product demand.\nIn addition, the overall decline in commodity prices in recent years has had a negative impact on the price of our common and preferred units. During 2016, our common unit price declined from a high of $3.11 on January 4, 2016 to a low of $0.50 on November 18, 2016. This low commodity price environment has had and will continue to have a direct impact on our revenue, cash flow from operations and Adjusted EBITDA until commodity prices improve. Sustained low prices or any further declines in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, profitability, future growth, borrowing base and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, sustained low prices or any further decline in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically, cause us to delay or postpone our planned capital expenditures and result in further impairments to our oil and natural gas properties. To illustrate the impact of a sustained low commodity price environment, we present the following two examples: (1) if we reduced the 12-month average price for natural gas by $1.00 per MMBtu and if we reduced the 12-month average price for oil by $6.00 per barrel, while production costs remained constant (which has historically not been the case in periods of declining commodity prices and declining production), our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would decrease from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 986.0 Bcfe, based on this price sensitivity generated from an internal evaluation of our proved reserves; and (2) if natural gas prices and oil prices were derived from the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price (using monthly NYMEX settlement prices through December 2022) at March 10, 2017, our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would increase from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 1,483.7 Bcfe. Below is a tabular presentation of the prices depicted in illustration (2) which differ from the SEC 12-month average pricing of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil (held constant):\n\n(1) Prices for 2022 and subsequent years were not escalated and were held flat for the remaining lives of the properties. Capital and lease operating expenses were also not inflated and held constant for the remaining lives of the properties.\nWhen comparing these settlement prices to the prices of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil used to generate our December 31, 2016 ( 4Q16\u201d) reserve report, the average annual prices for oil and natural gas for each annual year presented above is higher than the 4Q16 reserve report price. The impact of the increase in forward prices to gas wells and oil wells, as compared to the 4Q16 reserve report prices, includes (i) an extension of economic lives (ii) an increase in economically recoverable volumes, and (iii) even if such volumes did not increase, an increase in realized prices. Because the Company's asset mix is 65% natural gas paired with a higher rate increase in natural gas prices when compared to oil (specifically the year 2022 and forward), the hypothetical increase in natural gas reserves was greater than the hypothetical gain of oil and NGLs reserves on an MMcfe basis. The following table compares the 4Q16 reserve report volumes by product with the strip pricing volumes:\n\nManagement believes that the use of the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price may help provide investors with an understanding of the impact of the currently expected commodity price environment to our proved reserves. However, the use of this 5-year NYMEX forward strip price is not necessarily indicative of management's overall outlook on future commodity prices.\nWe recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $494.3 million. Such impairment was recognized during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 and was calculated based on 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas as follows:\n\nThe most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2016 were the reduction in our proved reserves quantities due to the reclassification of our proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources due to uncertainties surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves and the impact of sustained lower commodity prices. Prices have increased thus far in 2017, but still remain volatile. Further impairments of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may occur if commodity prices fall in the future. Potential future impairments are also contingent upon increases or decreases in our reserve base, changes in estimated costs and expenses, and oil and natural gas property acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $252.7 million during the third quarter of 2016 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $253.4 million, as a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions. Any further significant decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as continued declines in the quoted market price of the Company's units could require us to record additional impairment charges during future periods. Although these goodwill impairment charges are of a non-cash nature, they do adversely affect our results of operations in the periods which such charges are recorded.\nWe currently anticipate a capital expenditures budget for 2017 of approximately $150.0 million to $155.0 million, compared to the $64.5 million we spent in 2016. During 2017, we intend to concentrate our drilling on low risk, development opportunities with the majority of drilling capital focused on high Btu natural gas wells in four areas which we believe will continue to offer attractive drilling returns. We expect to spend between $57.0 million to $59.0 million or approximately 38% of the 2017 capital budget in the Green River Basin where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of vertical natural gas wells. Additionally, we expect to spend between $25.0 million to $26.0 million or approximately 17% of the capital budget in the Piceance Basin, at Mamm Creek Field where we will operate a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells. The balance of our capital drilling will be focused in the Gulf Coast Basin at Haynesville Field in Louisiana operating a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells and in the Arkoma Basin operating a one rig program drilling and completing horizontal Woodford wells.\nAs previously disclosed, in May 2016, the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the First Lien Lenders\u201d) decreased the Company's borrowing base from $1.78 billion to $1.325 billion (the Reserve-Based Credit Facility\u201d) resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of approximately $103.5 million. The Company made monthly payments of $17.5 million through September 30, 2016.\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company entered into the Waiver to its Credit Agreement, in which the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any event of default, so long as the payment is made within the 30-day grace period, resulting from the Company's election not to make the approximately $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 3, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020. Pursuant to the Waiver, the First Lien Lenders agreed that the Company's decision to take advantage of the applicable grace period under the indenture governing the Senior Notes due 2020 would not constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Company entered into the Limited Waiver and Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any events of default resulting from the Company's inability to maintain liquidity in excess of $50.0 million, giving pro forma effect to the Company's payments of (i) the $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 1, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 and (ii) the approximately $2.1 million semi-annual interest payment due on December 1, 2016 on approximately $51.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2019.\nIn conjunction with the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements and used the proceeds along with cash on hand first to pre-pay the First Lien Lenders (i) $29.3 million,\nrepresenting the remaining outstanding borrowing base deficiency resulting from the Company's borrowing base redetermination in May 2016 and (ii) $37.5 million, which was applied as the first required monthly payment to the Company's new borrowing base deficiency resulting from the November 2016 borrowing base redetermination discussed below. Also, the Company pledged to the First Lien Lenders certain unencumbered midstream assets as collateral as well as agreed to pay 100% of the net cash proceeds from any asset sale, swap or hedge monetization or other disposition to the First Lien Lenders. The borrowing base may be further reduced as a result of such disposition to the extent of the attributed value of such asset to the borrowing base. Furthermore, any incurrence of second lien debt will require the Company to prepay the First Lien Lenders equal to the net cash proceeds received by the Company from any second lien financing.\nOn November 3, 2016, the Company completed its semi-annual redetermination of its borrowing base, resulting in a reduction from $1.325 billion to $1.1 billion. After consideration of the first $37.5 million deficiency payment already having been made pursuant to entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment on October 26, 2016, the Company was scheduled to repay the remaining borrowing base deficiency of $187.5 million in five equal monthly installments of $37.5 million beginning in January 2017. The Company made the $15.1 million semi-annual interest payment with respect to its Senior Notes due 2020 on October 26, 2016. On January 3, 2017, the Company paid the second $37.5 million deficiency payment installment under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.\nAs discussed above, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on February 1, 2017 described above constitute an event of default that accelerated our indebtedness under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, our Senior Notes due 2019, Senior Notes due 2020 and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the related Credit Agreement and Indentures are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the Petitions and the holders' rights of enforcement in respect of the Credit Agreement and Indentures are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) During 2014 and 2015, we acquired certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets, as well as additional interests in these properties. The operating results of these properties are included with ours from the date of acquisition forward. During 2016, we divested certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets. As such, there are no operating results from these properties included in our operating results from the closing date of the divestitures forward. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nOil, natural gas and NGLs sales decreased by $8.5 million, or 2%, to $388.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The key revenue measurements were as follows:\n\n (1) During 2016, we divested certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets. As such, there are no operating results from these properties included in our operating results from the closing date of the divestitures forward. During 2015, we acquired certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets. The operating results of these properties are included from the closing date", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for natural gas, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A . Risk Factors\u201d and Forward Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to resume making monthly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, increase our monthly cash distributions through the acquisition of additional mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2016, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in ten operating basins:\n \u2022 the Green River Basin in Wyoming; \n \u2022 the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico; \n \u2022 the Piceance Basin in Colorado; \n \u2022 the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama; \n \u2022 the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma; \n \u2022 the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana; \n \u2022 the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana; \n \u2022 the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas; \n \u2022 the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and \n \u2022 the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. \nAt December 31, 2016, we owned working interests in 12,589 gross (4,444 net) productive wells. In addition to these productive wells, we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells. We own working interests in approximately 677,509 gross undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells.\nThe rapid and substantial decline in oil and gas prices for an extended period of time since mid-2014 through the early part of 2016 have negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows. Further, these sustained low oil and natural gas prices have had a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases described below, we took the steps described below to provide significant incremental cash flow, to allow us to meaningfully reduce our leverage over the course of 2016 and to provide sufficient liquidity to manage the expected reductions to the borrowing base in our Reserve-Based Credit Facility:\n \u2022 We significantly reduced our capital expenditures to $64.5 million in 2016 as compared to the $112.6 million spent in 2015. \n \u2022 On February 10, 2016, we issued approximately $75.6 million aggregate principal amount of new 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 in exchange for approximately $168.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2020 held by such holders. The \nSenior Secured Second Lien Notes were issued pursuant to an exchange offer. The Senior Secured Second Lien Notes will mature on (i) February 15, 2023 or (ii) December 31, 2019 if, prior to December 31, 2019, we have not repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid in full all of the Senior Notes due 2020 outstanding at that time in excess of $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount and, to the extent we have repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid the Senior Notes due 2020 with proceeds of certain indebtedness, if such indebtedness has a final maturity date no earlier than the date that is 91 days after February 15, 2023. This reduction in outstanding Senior Notes due 2020 reduced our interest expense by $7.9 million on an annual basis. Under our Credit Agreement, the issuance of new second lien debt requires, among other things, that our borrowing base decrease by 25% of the amount of new second lien debt. Because of this, in February 2016, the $1.8 billion borrowing base decreased by $18.9 million to $1.78 billion.\n \u2022 On February 25, 2016, our board of directors elected to suspend our monthly cash distribution on our common, Class B and Preferred Units effective with the February 2016 distribution. \n \u2022 On May 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids assets in the SCOOP/STACK area in Oklahoma to entities managed by Titanium Exploration Partners, LLC for $270.5 million (the SCOOP/STACK Divestiture\u201d). The Company used $268.4 million of the cash received to reduce borrowings under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility and $2.1 million to pay for some of the transaction fees related to the sale. We also completed sales of certain of our other properties in several different counties within our operating areas for an aggregate consideration of approximately $28.2 million. \n \u2022 In October 2016, in conjunction with entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment (defined in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements for total proceeds of approximately $42.3 million. Subsequently on December 19, 2016, Company completed a monetization of substantially all of its commodity and interest rate hedges with net proceeds totaling $11.7 million. \nBankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11\nChapter 11 Proceedings\nOn February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, we will continue to operate our business as debtors in possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nRestructuring Support Agreement\nPrior to the filing of the Petitions, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement\u201d) with (i) certain holders (the Consenting 2020 Noteholders\u201d) constituting approximately 52% of the 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes due 2020\u201d); (ii) certain holders (the Consenting 2019 Noteholders and, together with the Consenting 2020 Noteholders, the Consenting Senior Noteholders) constituting approximately 10% of the 8 3/8% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes due 2019,\u201d and all claims arising under or in connection with the Senior Notes due 2020 and Senior Notes due 2019, the Senior Note Claims\u201d); and (iii) certain holders (the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders\u201d and, together with the Consenting Senior Noteholders, the Restructuring Support Parties\u201d) constituting approximately 92% of the 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the Second Lien Notes,\u201d and all claims and obligations arising under or in connection with the Second Lien Notes, the Second Lien Note Claims\u201d).\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment of the Debtors and the Restructuring Support Parties to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Debtors' long-term debt (the Restructuring Transactions\u201d). The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through one or more plans of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) to be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Restructuring Transactions will be financed by (i) use of cash collateral, (ii) the proposed DIP Credit Agreement (as described below, (iii) a fully committed $19.25 million equity investment (the Second Lien Investment\u201d) by the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders and (iv) a $255.75 million rights offering (the Senior Note Rights Offering\u201d) that is fully backstopped by the Consenting Senior Noteholders.\nDebtor-in-Possession Financing\nIn connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion (the DIP Motion\u201d) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the Debtors' use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Agreement\u201d) among VNG (the DIP Borrower\u201d), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the DIP Agent\u201d) and as issuing bank. The initial lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement include lenders under the Company's existing first-lien credit agreement or the affiliates of such lenders.\nThe DIP Credit Agreement is subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Debtors anticipate closing the DIP Credit Agreement promptly following final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Motion.\nAutomatic Stay\nSubject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims.\nExecutory Contracts\nSubject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but may give rise to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach.\nChapter 11 Filing Impact on Creditors and Unitholders\nUnder the priority requirements established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities to creditors and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our existing common units are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or plans of reorganization. The outcome of the Chapter 11 cases remain uncertain at this time and, as a result, we cannot accurately estimate the amounts or value of distributions that creditors and unitholders may receive. It is possible that unitholders will receive no distribution on account of their interests. Please read Part I, Item 1, Business for further discussion on plan provisions.\nReorganization Expenses\nThe Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization, principally professional fees. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Chapter 11 Proceedings\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process as described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Because of these risks and uncertainties, the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Form 10-K may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process.\nRecent Developments and Outlook\nHistorically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitcal and economic conditions. During 2015 and through 2016, for example, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices decreased dramatically. The crude oil spot price per barrel during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 ranged from a high of $61.36 to a low of $26.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu during the same period ranged from a high of $3.44 to a low of $1.49. NGLs prices also suffered a similar decline. Commodity prices rallied in late 2016 and as of March 6, 2017, the crude oil spot price per barrel was $53.19 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price per MMBtu was $2.68. Among the factors causing such volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the ability of the OPEC members to comply with the agreed upon production cuts and the cooperation of other producing countries to reduce\nproduction levels, social unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States and the level and growth of consumer product demand.\nIn addition, the overall decline in commodity prices in recent years has had a negative impact on the price of our common and preferred units. During 2016, our common unit price declined from a high of $3.11 on January 4, 2016 to a low of $0.50 on November 18, 2016. This low commodity price environment has had and will continue to have a direct impact on our revenue, cash flow from operations and Adjusted EBITDA until commodity prices improve. Sustained low prices or any further declines in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, profitability, future growth, borrowing base and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, sustained low prices or any further decline in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs could reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically, cause us to delay or postpone our planned capital expenditures and result in further impairments to our oil and natural gas properties. To illustrate the impact of a sustained low commodity price environment, we present the following two examples: (1) if we reduced the 12-month average price for natural gas by $1.00 per MMBtu and if we reduced the 12-month average price for oil by $6.00 per barrel, while production costs remained constant (which has historically not been the case in periods of declining commodity prices and declining production), our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would decrease from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 986.0 Bcfe, based on this price sensitivity generated from an internal evaluation of our proved reserves; and (2) if natural gas prices and oil prices were derived from the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price (using monthly NYMEX settlement prices through December 2022) at March 10, 2017, our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 would increase from 1,363.2 Bcfe to 1,483.7 Bcfe. Below is a tabular presentation of the prices depicted in illustration (2) which differ from the SEC 12-month average pricing of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil (held constant):\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2022 (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>$51.93\n</td> <td>$52.10\n</td> <td>$51.76\n</td> <td>$52.14\n</td> <td>$53.12\n</td> <td>$54.34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>$3.20\n</td> <td>$3.04\n</td> <td>$2.88\n</td> <td>$2.84\n</td> <td>$2.84\n</td> <td>$2.85\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Prices for 2022 and subsequent years were not escalated and were held flat for the remaining lives of the properties. Capital and lease operating expenses were also not inflated and held constant for the remaining lives of the properties.\nWhen comparing these settlement prices to the prices of $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per barrel of crude oil used to generate our December 31, 2016 ( 4Q16\u201d) reserve report, the average annual prices for oil and natural gas for each annual year presented above is higher than the 4Q16 reserve report price. The impact of the increase in forward prices to gas wells and oil wells, as compared to the 4Q16 reserve report prices, includes (i) an extension of economic lives (ii) an increase in economically recoverable volumes, and (iii) even if such volumes did not increase, an increase in realized prices. Because the Company's asset mix is 65% natural gas paired with a higher rate increase in natural gas prices when compared to oil (specifically the year 2022 and forward), the hypothetical increase in natural gas reserves was greater than the hypothetical gain of oil and NGLs reserves on an MMcfe basis. The following table compares the 4Q16 reserve report volumes by product with the strip pricing volumes:\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Oil (Bbls)\n</td> <td>Net Gas (MMcf)\n</td> <td>Net NGL (Bbls)\n</td> <td>Net Bcfe\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve Report at 4Q16\n</td> <td>42,293\n</td> <td>888,916\n</td> <td>36,753\n</td> <td>1,363.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 10, 2017 NYMEX Strip Price\n</td> <td>47,346\n</td> <td>963,428\n</td> <td>39,364\n</td> <td>1,483.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Difference\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that the use of the 5-year NYMEX forward strip price may help provide investors with an understanding of the impact of the currently expected commodity price environment to our proved reserves. However, the use of this 5-year NYMEX forward strip price is not necessarily indicative of management's overall outlook on future commodity prices.\nWe recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $494.3 million. Such impairment was recognized during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 and was calculated based on 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas as follows:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impairment Amount (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Natural Gas ($ per MMBtu)\n</td> <td>Oil\n($ per Bbl)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.41\n</td> <td>$46.16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.24\n</td> <td>$42.91\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.29\n</td> <td>$41.48\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.47\n</td> <td>$42.60\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant factors causing us to record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the year ended December 31, 2016 were the reduction in our proved reserves quantities due to the reclassification of our proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources due to uncertainties surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves and the impact of sustained lower commodity prices. Prices have increased thus far in 2017, but still remain volatile. Further impairments of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may occur if commodity prices fall in the future. Potential future impairments are also contingent upon increases or decreases in our reserve base, changes in estimated costs and expenses, and oil and natural gas property acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $252.7 million during the third quarter of 2016 to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value of $253.4 million, as a result of the decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as deteriorating market conditions. Any further significant decline in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as continued declines in the quoted market price of the Company's units could require us to record additional impairment charges during future periods. Although these goodwill impairment charges are of a non-cash nature, they do adversely affect our results of operations in the periods which such charges are recorded.\nWe currently anticipate a capital expenditures budget for 2017 of approximately $150.0 million to $155.0 million, compared to the $64.5 million we spent in 2016. During 2017, we intend to concentrate our drilling on low risk, development opportunities with the majority of drilling capital focused on high Btu natural gas wells in four areas which we believe will continue to offer attractive drilling returns. We expect to spend between $57.0 million to $59.0 million or approximately 38% of the 2017 capital budget in the Green River Basin where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of vertical natural gas wells. Additionally, we expect to spend between $25.0 million to $26.0 million or approximately 17% of the capital budget in the Piceance Basin, at Mamm Creek Field where we will operate a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells. The balance of our capital drilling will be focused in the Gulf Coast Basin at Haynesville Field in Louisiana operating a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells and in the Arkoma Basin operating a one rig program drilling and completing horizontal Woodford wells.\nAs previously disclosed, in May 2016, the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the First Lien Lenders\u201d) decreased the Company's borrowing base from $1.78 billion to $1.325 billion (the Reserve-Based Credit Facility\u201d) resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of approximately $103.5 million. The Company made monthly payments of $17.5 million through September 30, 2016.\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company entered into the Waiver to its Credit Agreement, in which the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any event of default, so long as the payment is made within the 30-day grace period, resulting from the Company's election not to make the approximately $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 3, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020. Pursuant to the Waiver, the First Lien Lenders agreed that the Company's decision to take advantage of the applicable grace period under the indenture governing the Senior Notes due 2020 would not constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Company entered into the Limited Waiver and Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the First Lien Lenders agreed, among other things, subject to certain conditions, to waive any events of default resulting from the Company's inability to maintain liquidity in excess of $50.0 million, giving pro forma effect to the Company's payments of (i) the $15.0 million semi-annual interest payment due on October 1, 2016 on approximately $381.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 and (ii) the approximately $2.1 million semi-annual interest payment due on December 1, 2016 on approximately $51.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2019.\nIn conjunction with the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment, the Company monetized certain of its outstanding commodity price hedge agreements and used the proceeds along with cash on hand first to pre-pay the First Lien Lenders (i) $29.3 million,\nrepresenting the remaining outstanding borrowing base deficiency resulting from the Company's borrowing base redetermination in May 2016 and (ii) $37.5 million, which was applied as the first required monthly payment to the Company's new borrowing base deficiency resulting from the November 2016 borrowing base redetermination discussed below. Also, the Company pledged to the First Lien Lenders certain unencumbered midstream assets as collateral as well as agreed to pay 100% of the net cash proceeds from any asset sale, swap or hedge monetization or other disposition to the First Lien Lenders. The borrowing base may be further reduced as a result of such disposition to the extent of the attributed value of such asset to the borrowing base. Furthermore, any incurrence of second lien debt will require the Company to prepay the First Lien Lenders equal to the net cash proceeds received by the Company from any second lien financing.\nOn November 3, 2016, the Company completed its semi-annual redetermination of its borrowing base, resulting in a reduction from $1.325 billion to $1.1 billion. After consideration of the first $37.5 million deficiency payment already having been made pursuant to entering into the Waiver and Eleventh Amendment on October 26, 2016, the Company was scheduled to repay the remaining borrowing base deficiency of $187.5 million in five equal monthly installments of $37.5 million beginning in January 2017. The Company made the $15.1 million semi-annual interest payment with respect to its Senior Notes due 2020 on October 26, 2016. On January 3, 2017, the Company paid the second $37.5 million deficiency payment installment under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.\nAs discussed above, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on February 1, 2017 described above constitute an event of default that accelerated our indebtedness under our Reserve-Based Credit Facility, our Senior Notes due 2019, Senior Notes due 2020 and our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the related Credit Agreement and Indentures are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the Petitions and the holders' rights of enforcement in respect of the Credit Agreement and Indentures are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected financial and operating
