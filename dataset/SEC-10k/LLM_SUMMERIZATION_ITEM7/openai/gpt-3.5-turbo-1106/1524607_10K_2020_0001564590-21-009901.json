We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and South America. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing to these operators through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis (typically 15 years) with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 392 properties leased or loaned to 49 operators, of which two were under development and six were in the form of mortgage loans.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following sets forth selected consolidated financial and operating data.

As COVID-19 ramped up, governments around the world looked to hospitals and hospital operators to provide necessary care to victims of the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, our tenants were impacted by the governmental mandates to defer elective surgeries, the takeover of certain facilities by the governments in certain countries, and the overall downturn in the economy in general. By the 2020 third quarter, our tenants were back accepting patients and performing medically necessary elective procedures, resulting in improved volumes compared to the 2020 second quarter. Despite all of this, we received all but 2% of our annual rent and interest payments in 2020. For the 2% not collected as scheduled, we have agreements in place to collect such deferred amounts plus interest. We expect to continue to receive substantially all future rent and interest payments; however, no assurances can be made that if the pandemic continues for an extended period of time that our rent and interest payments will not be delayed into the future until our tenants can recover.\nIn addition to the collection of almost all of our rent and interest during the pandemic, we, along with our operators, executed on several accretive growth initiatives during 2020 despite the environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we invested approximately $3.6 billion in hospital real estate. Additionally, we have maintained liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic by raising more than $400.0 million in proceeds through sales of our common stock in our at-the-market program, receiving more than $500.0 million from payoffs on our loan portfolio and divestitures, and completing a $1.3 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes offering, of which approximately $833 million was used to refinance debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 6%. We also increased our dividend to $0.27 per share per quarter in 2020, which is the 6th year in a row for such an increase. Finally, shortly after year-end, we were able to extend and improve pricing of our revolving credit and term loan facility ( Credit Facility\u201d).\nA summary of our 2020 highlights is as follows:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquired the following real estate assets:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquired 30 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom for a purchase price of approximately \u00a31.5 billion.

We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether investments we make in certain businesses/entities should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties (such as the ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations, adverse economic and political conditions, and other events ongoing (such as the recent health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak) on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an\namount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, we began applying a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model to all of our financing receivables, including financing leases and loans. With this change, we have grouped our financial instruments into two primary pools of similar credit risk: secured and unsecured. The secured instruments include our investments in financing receivables as all are secured by the underlying real estate among other collateral. Within the two primary pools, we further grouped our instruments into sub-pools based on several tenant/borrower characteristics, including years of experience in the healthcare industry and in a particular market or region and overall capitalization. We then determined a credit loss percentage per pool based on our history over a period of time that closely matches the remaining terms of the financial instruments being analyzed and adjusted as needed for current trends or unusual circumstances. We have applied these credit loss percentages to the book value of the related instruments to establish a credit loss reserve on our financing lease receivables and such credit loss reserve (including the underlying assumptions) is reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a financing receivable is underperforming and is deemed uncollectible based on the lessee's overall financial condition, we will adjust the credit loss reserve based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWith the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we made the accounting policy election to exclude interest receivables from the credit loss reserve analysis. Such receivables are impaired and an allowance recorded when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition, economic resources and payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors, and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. Like our financing lease receivables, we are using ASU 2016-13 to establish credit loss reserves on all outstanding loans based on historical credit losses on similar instruments. Such credit loss reserves, including the underlying assumptions, are reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a loan's performance worsens and foreclosure is deemed probable for our collateral-based loans (after considering the borrower's overall financial condition as described above for leases), we will adjust the allowance for expected credit losses based on the current fair value of such collateral at the time the loan is deemed uncollectible. If the loan is not collateralized, the loan will be written-off once it is determined that such loan is no longer collectible. Interest receivables on loans are excluded from ASU 2016-13 and we assess their collectability similar to how we assess collectability for interest receivables on financing leases described above.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of impairment assessments, we will look to a number of sources including independent appraisals, available broker data, or our internal data from recent transactions involving similar properties in similar markets. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2020; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for operating leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) but can be longer depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination.\nOther intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2020, we have not assigned any value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted-average useful life of 26.1 years at December 31, 2020. If a lease is terminated early, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur typical sources of cash include our monthly rent and interest receipts, distributions from our five real estate joint venture agreements, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, and proceeds from bank debt, asset dispositions (either one-off or group asset sales through joint venture transactions), and principal payments on loans. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service (including principal and interest), new investments (including acquisitions, developments, or capital improvement projects), loan advances, property expenses, and general and administrative expenses.\nAbsent our requirements to make distributions to maintain our REIT qualification (as more fully described in Note 5 within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and our current contractual commitments discussed later, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nSee below for highlights of our sources and uses of cash for the past three years:\n2020 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $617.6 million from operating activities during 2020, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows to fund our dividends of $568 million and certain investing activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2020, we did the following:\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> a)\n</td> <td> Invested $3.6 billion in real estate assets and other loans, net of $835 million in mortgage loan conversions, representing over 40 facilities across five countries, headlined by the \u00a31.5 billion Circle acquisition of 30 properties in January 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> b)\n</td> <td> Funded approximately $167.2 million of development, capital addition, and other projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> c)\n</td> <td> Issued 21.0 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity offering program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $411 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> d)\n</td> <td> Closed on a \u00a3700 million British pound sterling term loan to help fund the Circle acquisition in January 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> e)\n</td> <td> Received approximately $1.3 billion in loan principal repayments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> f)\n</td> <td> Sold 15 facilities generating net proceeds of $94 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> g)\n</td> <td> Completed a $1.3 billion, 3.5% senior unsecured notes offering on December 4, 2020, using proceeds to pay off $800 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 6%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, we invested another \u00a31.1 billion as part of the Priory transaction funded using a combination of sources including a completed underwritten public offering of 36.8 million shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $711.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and utilizing approximately \u00a3500 million of a $900 million interim credit facility.\n2019 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $494.1 million from operating activities during 2019, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans.

In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of NAFFO, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances, and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations, and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled Distribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 19, 2021, we have no debt principal payments due within the next twelve months. In January 2021, we amended our revolving credit facility to extend it until February 2024 and improve pricing. At February 19, 2021, and after our funding of the \u00a31.1 billion Priory transaction using proceeds from the January 2020 equity offering that raised approximately $711 million and utilizing approximately \u00a3500 million of a $900 million interim loan facility, availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $1.3 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, approximately $584.3 million of availability under our at-the-market equity program, and approximately \u00a3250 million expected to be repaid by Waterland pursuant to the Priory short-term loan is sufficient to fund our operations, dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements, and our current firm commitments and debt service obligations as noted below for the next twelve months.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 19, 2021, our liquidity approximates $1.3 billion and we believe our liquidity, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and approximately $584.3 million\nof availability under our at-the-market equity program, is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, in order to fund additional investments, to fund debt maturities coming due starting in 2022 and beyond (as outlined below in our commitment schedule), or to strategically refinance any existing debt in order to reduce interest rates, we may need to access one or a combination of the following sources of capital:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> sale of equity securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td>

conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions (particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) or that our plans will be successful.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table

This 15% increase in net income is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments made in 2019 and 2020, including revenue from the Circle transaction in January 2020. Such increase in revenue was partially offset by higher interest expense (from additional debt to partially finance these new investments) and depreciation expense. In addition, we incurred higher general and administrative costs and income tax expense due to the growth of the company internationally, including $9 million of higher income tax expense related to the increase in corporate tax rates in the United Kingdom. Finally, we had $42 million of gains on property disposals in 2019 versus a small loss in 2020. Normalized FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $831.2 million, or $1.57 per diluted share for 2020, as compared to $557.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for 2019. This 21% increase in Normalized FFO per share is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments in 2019 and 2020.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 741,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 267,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 206,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,477\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,249,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 854,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 395,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2020 are up $395.0 million or 46% over the prior year.

This increase is partially offset by $43.5 million of lower revenue from disposals (in 2019 and 2020) and properties vacated in 2020, as well as more straight-line rent write-offs than in 2019 from the property disposals, re-leasing activities, and other lease modifications as described in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income from financing leases - up $86.9 million compared to 2019 due to $89.3 million of revenue from the Prospect acquisition in the 2019 third quarter, partially offset by the impact from the reclassification of six properties from deferred financing leases to operating leases due to certain lease modifications in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Interest and other income - down $7.5 million from the prior year due to the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Interest from loans - down $7.7 million over the prior year of which $25.9 million is the result of lower interest revenue related to Steward mortgage loans converted to fee simple assets in the third quarter of 2020 (as more fully described in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $5.7 million is from the repayment of Prime loans in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease is partially offset by $24.0 million of incremental revenue earned on new loan investments, including $10.2 million earned on the loan made to the new international joint venture in May 2020 (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details) and $7.9 million of incremental interest revenue from the Prospect loans made in August 2019, along with $0.4 million from favorable foreign currency fluctuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other income - up $0.2 million from the prior year due to additional properties acquired in 2019 and 2020, whereby we received more direct reimbursements from our tenants for ground lease, property taxes, and insurance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense for 2020 and 2019 totaled $328.7 million and $237.8 million, respectively. This increase is primarily related to new debt issuances in 2020 and 2019 as our weighted-average interest rate year-over-year decreased from 4.45% in 2019 to 3.88% in 2020.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2020 increased to $264.2 million from $152.3 million in 2019 due to new investments made in 2019 and 2020.\nProperty-related expenses for 2020 increased slightly compared to 2019. This increase is primarily due to property taxes and other expenses incurred on vacant properties. Of the $24.9 million of property expenses in 2020, approximately $14 million represents costs that were reimbursed by our tenants and included in Interest and other income\u201d line on our consolidated statements of net income.\nAs a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses represent 10.5% for 2020, a decline from the 11.3% in the prior year. On a dollar basis, general and administrative expenses totaled $131.7 million for 2020, which is a $35.3 million increase from 2019. Of this increase, $21.7 million relates to compensation primarily related to higher stock compensation expense from our performance-based awards. The balance of the increase is primarily related to other corporate expenses, which are higher due to the growth of the company, in particular our international expansion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we disposed of nine properties and six ancillary properties resulting in a net loss of $2.8 million. In addition, we made a $19.0 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate on certain Adeptus Health,\nInc. ( Adeptus\u201d) properties and one Alecto Healthcare Services LLC ( Alecto\u201d) facility in the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). In comparison, we sold five properties in 2019 for a gain of $41.6 million and incurred $21.0 million of real estate impairment charges on certain vacant properties.\nEarnings from equity interests was $20.4 million for 2020, up $4.4 million from 2019 primarily due to incremental income generated on our investments in Infracore and HM Hospitales made in the second and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively.\nDebt refinancing and unutilized financing costs were $28.2 million in 2020 due to the redemption premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred debt issuance cost incurred as a result of the prepayment of our $800 million senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2020. The redeemed unsecured notes had a weighted-average interest rate of 6%, which we refinanced at 3.5%. In 2019, we incurred $6.1 million of bridge loan fees and accelerated commitment fee amortization expense associated with our Australian and GBP term loan facilities.\nOther expense of $6.8 million for 2020 is primarily related to non-cash fair value adjustments to mark our investment in Aevis Victoria SA stock to market. This stock declined during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We acquired this stock as part of our overall Switzerland investment in May 2019.\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our domestic TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The $31.1 million income tax expense for 2020 is primarily from the income generated by our investments in the United Kingdom, including a one-time adjustment of approximately $9 million to reflect the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities due to an increase in the United Kingdom corporate tax rate from 17% to 19% in the third quarter of 2020. In comparison, we incurred a $2.6 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the benefit on losses incurred by our TRS during 2019. The 2019 tax benefit was partially offset by tax expense on income generated by our international investments.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately $37 million should be reflected against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and incur higher income taxes in future periods as income is earned. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $374.7 million compared to net income of $1.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This decrease is partially offset by approximately $70 million more in revenues from new investments in 2019. Normalized FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $557.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for 2019, as compared to $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2018. This increase in Normalized FFO dollars is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments in 2019, while Normalized FFO per share is lower due to approximately 145 million of new shares issued to fund new investments in 2019.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 854,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2019 were up $69.7 million or 9% over the prior year.

This increase is primarily related to new debt issuances in 2019 including the \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes issued in December 2019, the $900 million of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2019, and the A$1.2 billion term loan funded in June 2019. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million of bridge loan fees and accelerated commitment fee amortization expense associated with our Australian and GBP term loan facilities in 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower interest in 2019 from the paydown of our revolver, in addition to a reduction in our weighted-average interest rate year-over-year from 4.55% in 2018 to 4.45% in 2019.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2019 increased to $152.3 million from $133.1 million in 2018 due to new investments made in 2018 and 2019 and the conversion of the five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets, partially offset by property sales in 2018.\nProperty-related expenses for 2019 increased $14.8 million compared to 2018. As noted above under the caption Other income\u201d, this increase was primarily due to the grossing up of certain expenses (such as ground lease, property taxes, and insurance) as part of our implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 totaled $96.4 million, which is a $16.3 million increase from 2018. The majority of the increase relates to stock compensation expense from our performance-based awards. Given our strong performance in 2019 including a 39% total shareholder return and significant growth from $4.5 billion of new investments, certain performance awards were earned at maximum level, resulting in higher stock compensation expense in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold five properties resulting in a total gain of $41.6 million. In addition, we made a $21 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate on certain vacant facilities in 2019- see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. In 2018, we sold five properties in the U.S. and 71 properties as part of the joint venture transaction with Primotop resulting in a gain of $719.4 million. In addition, we made a $48 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate to fair value on seven of our transitioning Adeptus facilities and four of our Alecto facilities in 2018.\nEarnings from equity interests was $16.1 million for 2019, up $1.9 million from 2018 due to our investment in the Primotop joint venture in the third quarter of 2018 and our investment in Infracore made at the end of the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by a lower return year-over-year in our Hoboken investment.\nIncome tax expense typically includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The $2.6 million income tax benefit for 2019 is primarily related to the benefit on losses incurred by our TRS during the year. The benefit is partially offset by tax expense on income generated by our international investments. In comparison, we incurred $0.9 million of income tax expense in 2018 primarily from income generated by our international investments that was partially offset by $4.4 million of valuation allowances released related to U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of our TRS.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a full valuation allowance of $11.4 million should continue to be recorded against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and incur higher income taxes in future periods as income is earned. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nInvestors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nIn addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations less meaningful to investors and analysts.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MPT common stockholders to FFO and Normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, (amounts in thousands except per share data):\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO Information\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to MPT common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 431,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 374,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Participating securities' share in earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,685\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income, less participating securities' share in earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 429,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 372,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,013,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 306,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 183,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (719,392\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 535,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 485,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-off of straight-line rent and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash fair value adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,908\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes -

We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and South America. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing to these operators through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis (typically 15 years) with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 392 properties leased or loaned to 49 operators, of which two were under development and six were in the form of mortgage loans.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following sets forth selected consolidated financial and operating data. You should read the following selected financial data in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of each of Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. and their respective subsidiaries included in Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n (1) See section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful along with a reconciliation to our GAAP earnings. \n2020 Highlights\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, including in countries where we own and lease facilities, has further validated our business model, which focuses on hospitals as the centerpiece of healthcare delivery across the world. As COVID-19 ramped up, governments around the world looked to hospitals and hospital operators to provide necessary care to victims of the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, our tenants were impacted by the governmental mandates to defer elective surgeries, the takeover of certain facilities by the governments in certain countries, and the overall downturn in the economy in general. By the 2020 third quarter, our tenants were back accepting patients and performing medically necessary elective procedures, resulting in improved volumes compared to the 2020 second quarter. Despite all of this, we received all but 2% of our annual rent and interest payments in 2020. For the 2% not collected as scheduled, we have agreements in place to collect such deferred amounts plus interest. We expect to continue to receive substantially all future rent and interest payments; however, no assurances can be made that if the pandemic continues for an extended period of time that our rent and interest payments will not be delayed into the future until our tenants can recover.\nIn addition to the collection of almost all of our rent and interest during the pandemic, we, along with our operators, executed on several accretive growth initiatives during 2020 despite the environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we invested approximately $3.6 billion in hospital real estate. Additionally, we have maintained liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic by raising more than $400.0 million in proceeds through sales of our common stock in our at-the-market program, receiving more than $500.0 million from payoffs on our loan portfolio and divestitures, and completing a $1.3 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes offering, of which approximately $833 million was used to refinance debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 6%. We also increased our dividend to $0.27 per share per quarter in 2020, which is the 6th year in a row for such an increase. Finally, shortly after year-end, we were able to extend and improve pricing of our revolving credit and term loan facility ( Credit Facility\u201d).\nA summary of our 2020 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired the following real estate assets: \n \u2022 Acquired 30 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom for a purchase price of approximately \u00a31.5 billion. These facilities are leased to Circle; \n \u2022 Formed a new joint venture for the purpose of investing in the operations of international hospitals and originated a $205 million acquisition loan as part of this formation. We have a 49% interest in this joint venture, which simultaneously purchased from Steward the rights and existing assets related to all present and future international opportunities previously owned by Steward for strategic, regulatory, and risk management purposes; \n \u2022 Completed construction and began recording rental income on two general acute care facilities and one IRF; \n \u2022 Commenced the development of two IRFs in California for a total budget of $95.6 million. These facilities will be leased to Ernest Health, Inc. ( Ernest\u201d) upon completion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022; \n \u2022 Acquired the fee simple real estate of two general acute care hospitals in Utah for a total investment of $950 million in exchange for the reduction of the mortgage loans made to Steward for such properties and additional cash consideration of $200 million based on their relative fair value; \n \u2022 Acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility in Germany for approximately \u20ac12.5 million leased to MEDIAN; \n \u2022 Acquired two private acute care facilities in the United Kingdom for a total of approximately \u00a3115 million leased to Circle; \n \u2022 Acquired a general acute care hospital in Lynwood, California for a total investment of approximately $300 million. This facility is leased to affiliates of Prime Healthcare Services, Inc. (collectively, Prime\u201d); \n \u2022 Acquired a general acute care facility in the United Kingdom for \u00a350.0 million leased to a new tenant, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; \n \u2022 Financed three general acute care hospitals in Colombia for approximately $135 million operated by the new international joint venture; \n \u2022 Acquired two inpatient rehabilitation facilities, one in Texas and one in Indiana, for a total of approximately $58 million leased to Curahealth Hospitals, a new tenant to us; \n \u2022 Acquired an additional equity ownership in Infracore SA ( Infracore\u201d) for CHF 206.5 million; and \n \u2022 Acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility in South Carolina for $17.0 million leased to Ernest. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire 35 to 40 behavioral health facilities currently owned and operated by Priory for an aggregate purchase price of approximately \u00a3800 million along with a \u00a3250 million short-term acquisition loan. To help fund these investments subsequent to year-end, we completed an underwritten public offering of 36.8 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $711.0 million, after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, along with utilizing approximately \u00a3500 million of a $900 million interim credit facility at terms similar to our Credit Facility.\n2019 Highlights\nIn 2019, we invested in approximately $4.5 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and Europe, and entering into new territories such as Australia. To fund these new investments, we raised $2.5 billion in proceeds from equity sales during 2019, received proceeds of $837 million from an Australian term loan facility in June 2019, and completed $900 million and \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes offerings in July and December 2019, respectively.\nA summary of our 2019 highlights was as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets or commenced development projects totaling more than $4.5 billion, as noted below: \n \u2022 Invested in three acute care hospitals and one IRF for an aggregate investment of approximately $135 million, leased to four separate operators; \n \u2022 Invested in a portfolio of 13 acute care campuses and two additional properties in Switzerland for a combined purchase price of approximately CHF 236.6 million, effected through our purchase of a minority interest in a Swiss healthcare real estate company, Infracore. These facilities are leased to Swiss Medical Network. Additionally, we purchased a 4.9% stake in Aevis Victoria SA, previous majority shareholder of Infracore, for CHF 47 million; \n \u2022 Acquired 11 hospitals in Australia for a purchase price of approximately A$1.2 billion plus stamp duties and registration fees of A$66.6 million. These facilities are leased to Healthscope Ltd. ( Healthscope\u201d); \n \u2022 Acquired seven community hospitals in Kansas for approximately $145.4 million. These facilities are leased to Saint Luke's Health System; \n \u2022 Acquired 14 acute care hospitals and two behavioral health facilities for a combined purchase price of approximately $1.55 billion. These facilities are leased to Prospect; \n \u2022 Acquired eight private hospitals located throughout England for an aggregate purchase price of \u00a3347 million. These facilities are leased to Ramsay Health Care; \n \u2022 Acquired 10 post-acute facilities in various states throughout the U.S. for approximately $268 million. These facilities are leased to Vibra Healthcare, LLC; \n \u2022 Commenced the development of a behavioral hospital in Houston, Texas for $27.5 million, which opened in the 2020 fourth quarter and leased to NeuroPsychiatric Hospitals; \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Portugal for approximately \u20ac28.2 million. This facility is leased to Jos\u00e9 de Mello; \n \u2022 Acquired two acute care hospitals in Spain for \u20ac117.3 million, effected through our purchase of a 45% interest in a joint venture. These facilities are leased to HM Hospitales; and \n \u2022 Acquired 10 acute care hospitals in six U.S. states for approximately $700.0 million leased to LifePoint Health, Inc. ( LifePoint\u201d). \n \u2022 To help fund the investments in 2019, we used cash on-hand and generated proceeds through equity offerings, utilization of our at-the-market equity program, through new issuances of unsecured notes, and from sales of real estate. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Sold 36.1 million shares under our at-the-market equity program, generating proceeds of approximately $650 million; \n \u2022 Received proceeds from an Australian term facility of approximately $837 million in June 2019 and fixed the interest rate to approximately 2.45% in July 2019 using an interest rate swap; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 51.75 million shares of our common stock in July 2019, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $860 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a $900 million senior unsecured notes offering in July 2019 with a rate of 4.625%; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock in November 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $1.026 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a \u00a3400 million and \u00a3600 million unsecured notes offering in December 2019 with a rate of 2.550% and 3.692%, respectively; and \n \u2022 Sold five properties in 2019 generating a gain of $41.6 million. \n2018 Highlights\nIn 2018, we demonstrated the value of our portfolio through strategic property sales that generated gains exceeding $700 million and cash proceeds of approximately $2 billion.\nA summary of our 2018 highlights was as follows:\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of 76 properties (71 of which were contributed to a joint venture arrangement) and sold our equity interest in Ernest (along with the repayment of all outstanding loans and accrued interest) for a net gain of approximately $720 million, as noted below: \n \u2022 Sold two acute care hospitals in Houston, Texas for a net gain of approximately $100 million; \n \u2022 Sold three long-term acute care hospitals located in California, Texas, and Oregon, for $53 million of cash and resulting in a net gain of $19.1 million; \n \u2022 Sold 71 properties located in Germany for a net gain of approximately \u20ac500 million by way of a joint venture arrangement, for which we own a 50% interest; and \n \u2022 Sold our investment in the operations of Ernest and were repaid outstanding loans and accrued interest generating over $176 million in cash. \n \u2022 Acquired the following real estate assets: \n \u2022 Acquired three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u20ac17.3 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN; \n \u2022 Acquired five acute care hospitals from Steward in exchange for the reduction of $764 million in mortgage loans plus cash, which further increased the strength of our portfolio; and \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Pasco, Washington for $17.5 million.

We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether investments we make in certain businesses/entities should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties (such as the ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations, adverse economic and political conditions, and other events ongoing (such as the recent health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak) on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an\namount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, we began applying a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model to all of our financing receivables, including financing leases and loans. With this change, we have grouped our financial instruments into two primary pools of similar credit risk: secured and unsecured. The secured instruments include our investments in financing receivables as all are secured by the underlying real estate among other collateral. Within the two primary pools, we further grouped our instruments into sub-pools based on several tenant/borrower characteristics, including years of experience in the healthcare industry and in a particular market or region and overall capitalization. We then determined a credit loss percentage per pool based on our history over a period of time that closely matches the remaining terms of the financial instruments being analyzed and adjusted as needed for current trends or unusual circumstances. We have applied these credit loss percentages to the book value of the related instruments to establish a credit loss reserve on our financing lease receivables and such credit loss reserve (including the underlying assumptions) is reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a financing receivable is underperforming and is deemed uncollectible based on the lessee's overall financial condition, we will adjust the credit loss reserve based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWith the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we made the accounting policy election to exclude interest receivables from the credit loss reserve analysis. Such receivables are impaired and an allowance recorded when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition, economic resources and payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors, and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. Like our financing lease receivables, we are using ASU 2016-13 to establish credit loss reserves on all outstanding loans based on historical credit losses on similar instruments. Such credit loss reserves, including the underlying assumptions, are reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a loan's performance worsens and foreclosure is deemed probable for our collateral-based loans (after considering the borrower's overall financial condition as described above for leases), we will adjust the allowance for expected credit losses based on the current fair value of such collateral at the time the loan is deemed uncollectible. If the loan is not collateralized, the loan will be written-off once it is determined that such loan is no longer collectible. Interest receivables on loans are excluded from ASU 2016-13 and we assess their collectability similar to how we assess collectability for interest receivables on financing leases described above.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of impairment assessments, we will look to a number of sources including independent appraisals, available broker data, or our internal data from recent transactions involving similar properties in similar markets. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2020; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for operating leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to our,\u201d we,\u201d and us\u201d in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and South America. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing to these operators through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis (typically 15 years) with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 392 properties leased or loaned to 49 operators, of which two were under development and six were in the form of mortgage loans.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following sets forth selected consolidated financial and operating data.

As COVID-19 ramped up, governments around the world looked to hospitals and hospital operators to provide necessary care to victims of the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, our tenants were impacted by the governmental mandates to defer elective surgeries, the takeover of certain facilities by the governments in certain countries, and the overall downturn in the economy in general. By the 2020 third quarter, our tenants were back accepting patients and performing medically necessary elective procedures, resulting in improved volumes compared to the 2020 second quarter. Despite all of this, we received all but 2% of our annual rent and interest payments in 2020. For the 2% not collected as scheduled, we have agreements in place to collect such deferred amounts plus interest. We expect to continue to receive substantially all future rent and interest payments; however, no assurances can be made that if the pandemic continues for an extended period of time that our rent and interest payments will not be delayed into the future until our tenants can recover.\nIn addition to the collection of almost all of our rent and interest during the pandemic, we, along with our operators, executed on several accretive growth initiatives during 2020 despite the environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we invested approximately $3.6 billion in hospital real estate. Additionally, we have maintained liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic by raising more than $400.0 million in proceeds through sales of our common stock in our at-the-market program, receiving more than $500.0 million from payoffs on our loan portfolio and divestitures, and completing a $1.3 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes offering, of which approximately $833 million was used to refinance debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 6%. We also increased our dividend to $0.27 per share per quarter in 2020, which is the 6th year in a row for such an increase. Finally, shortly after year-end, we were able to extend and improve pricing of our revolving credit and term loan facility ( Credit Facility\u201d).\nA summary of our 2020 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired the following real estate assets: \n \u2022 Acquired 30 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom for a purchase price of approximately \u00a31.5 billion. These facilities are leased to Circle; \n \u2022 Formed a new joint venture for the purpose of investing in the operations of international hospitals and originated a $205 million acquisition loan as part of this formation. We have a 49% interest in this joint venture, which simultaneously purchased from Steward the rights and existing assets related to all present and future international opportunities previously owned by Steward for strategic, regulatory, and risk management purposes; \n \u2022 Completed construction and began recording rental income on two general acute care facilities and one IRF; \n \u2022 Commenced the development of two IRFs in California for a total budget of $95.6 million. These facilities will be leased to Ernest Health, Inc. ( Ernest\u201d) upon completion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022; \n \u2022 Acquired the fee simple real estate of two general acute care hospitals in Utah for a total investment of $950 million in exchange for the reduction of the mortgage loans made to Steward for such properties and additional cash consideration of $200 million based on their relative fair value; \n \u2022 Acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility in Germany for approximately \u20ac12.5 million leased to MEDIAN; \n \u2022 Acquired two private acute care facilities in the United Kingdom for a total of approximately \u00a3115 million leased to Circle; \n \u2022 Acquired a general acute care hospital in Lynwood, California for a total investment of approximately $300 million. This facility is leased to affiliates of Prime Healthcare Services, Inc. (collectively, Prime\u201d); \n \u2022 Acquired a general acute care facility in the United Kingdom for \u00a350.0 million leased to a new tenant, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; \n \u2022 Financed three general acute care hospitals in Colombia for approximately $135 million operated by the new international joint venture; \n \u2022 Acquired two inpatient rehabilitation facilities, one in Texas and one in Indiana, for a total of approximately $58 million leased to Curahealth Hospitals, a new tenant to us; \n \u2022 Acquired an additional equity ownership in Infracore SA ( Infracore\u201d) for CHF 206.5 million; and \n \u2022 Acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility in South Carolina for $17.0 million leased to Ernest. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire 35 to 40 behavioral health facilities currently owned and operated by Priory for an aggregate purchase price of approximately \u00a3800 million along with a \u00a3250 million short-term acquisition loan. To help fund these investments subsequent to year-end, we completed an underwritten public offering of 36.8 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $711.0 million, after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, along with utilizing approximately \u00a3500 million of a $900 million interim credit facility at terms similar to our Credit Facility.\n2019 Highlights\nIn 2019, we invested in approximately $4.5 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and Europe, and entering into new territories such as Australia.

We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether investments we make in certain businesses/entities should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties (such as the ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations, adverse economic and political conditions, and other events ongoing (such as the recent health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak) on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an\namount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, we began applying a new forward-looking expected loss\u201d model to all of our financing receivables, including financing leases and loans. With this change, we have grouped our financial instruments into two primary pools of similar credit risk: secured and unsecured. The secured instruments include our investments in financing receivables as all are secured by the underlying real estate among other collateral. Within the two primary pools, we further grouped our instruments into sub-pools based on several tenant/borrower characteristics, including years of experience in the healthcare industry and in a particular market or region and overall capitalization. We then determined a credit loss percentage per pool based on our history over a period of time that closely matches the remaining terms of the financial instruments being analyzed and adjusted as needed for current trends or unusual circumstances. We have applied these credit loss percentages to the book value of the related instruments to establish a credit loss reserve on our financing lease receivables and such credit loss reserve (including the underlying assumptions) is reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a financing receivable is underperforming and is deemed uncollectible based on the lessee's overall financial condition, we will adjust the credit loss reserve based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nWith the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we made the accounting policy election to exclude interest receivables from the credit loss reserve analysis. Such receivables are impaired and an allowance recorded when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition, economic resources and payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors, and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. Like our financing lease receivables, we are using ASU 2016-13 to establish credit loss reserves on all outstanding loans based on historical credit losses on similar instruments. Such credit loss reserves, including the underlying assumptions, are reviewed and adjusted quarterly. If a loan's performance worsens and foreclosure is deemed probable for our collateral-based loans (after considering the borrower's overall financial condition as described above for leases), we will adjust the allowance for expected credit losses based on the current fair value of such collateral at the time the loan is deemed uncollectible. If the loan is not collateralized, the loan will be written-off once it is determined that such loan is no longer collectible. Interest receivables on loans are excluded from ASU 2016-13 and we assess their collectability similar to how we assess collectability for interest receivables on financing leases described above.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of impairment assessments, we will look to a number of sources including independent appraisals, available broker data, or our internal data from recent transactions involving similar properties in similar markets. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2020; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for operating leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental"}
