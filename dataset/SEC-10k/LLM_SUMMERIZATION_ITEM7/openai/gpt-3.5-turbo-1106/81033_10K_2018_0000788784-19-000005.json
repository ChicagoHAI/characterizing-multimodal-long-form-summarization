Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2018 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2018 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nOur business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing system reliability and resiliency, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy projects. Over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. Over the next five years, we expect to invest between $11 billion and $16 billion in our business which is expected to provide an annual rate base growth of 7%-9%. We completed our Energy Strong Program I (ES I) and essentially completed our Gas System Modernization Program I (GSMP I). See Item 1. Business-Business Operations and Strategy-PSE&G for a description of these programs.\nIn May 2018, we received approval for our Gas System Modernization Program II (GSMP II), an expanded, five-year program to invest $1.9 billion beginning in 2019 to replace approximately 875 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains in addition to other improvements to the gas system. Approximately $1.6 billion will be recovered through periodic rate roll-ins, with the remaining $300 million to be recovered through a future base rate proceeding. As part of the settlement, PSE&G agreed to file a base rate proceeding no later than five years from the commencement of the program, to maintain a base level of gas distribution capital expenditures of $155 million per year and to achieve certain leak reduction targets.\nIn June 2018, we filed for our Energy Strong Program II (ES II), a proposed five-year $2.5 billion program to harden, modernize and make our electric and gas distribution systems more resilient. The size and duration of ES II, as well as certain other elements of the program, are subject to BPU approval. The review process is expected to conclude in mid-2019.\nIn October 2018, we filed our proposed Clean Energy Future (CEF) program with the BPU, a six-year estimated $3.6 billion investment covering four programs; (i) an Energy Efficiency (EE) program totaling $2.5 billion of investment designed to\nachieve energy efficiency targets required under New Jersey's Clean Energy law; (ii) an Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure program; (iii) an Energy Storage (ES) program and (iv) an Energy Cloud (EC) program which will include installing approximately two million electric smart meters and associated infrastructure. The review process for the CEF-EE program is expected to conclude by the third quarter of 2019. The CEF-EV/ ES and CEF-EC programs will have separate procedural schedules.\nIn November 2018, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (Rate Counsel) filed a motion to dismiss the CEF-EC filing on the basis that the BPU announced a moratorium on electric distribution companies' AMI program. In December 2018, Rate Counsel filed a motion to stay the CEF-EV/ES filing, arguing that the BPU should conclude other regulatory proceedings addressing EVs and ES, including the new Energy Master Plan and initiatives required by the Clean Energy Act, before it rules on PSE&G's program. We opposed Rate Counsel's motions, asking for the BPU to permit these filings to proceed. There is no timetable for the BPU to decide on Rate Counsel's motions.\nAlso, in October 2018, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our distribution base rate proceeding with new rates effective November 1, 2018. The settlement resulted in a net reduction in overall annual revenues of approximately $13 million, comprised of a $212 million increase in base revenues, which includes the recovery of deferred storm costs, and the return of tax benefits largely due to tax reform of approximately $225 million. The Order provides for a distribution rate base of $9.5 billion, a 9.6% return on equity (ROE) for our distribution business and a 54% equity component of our capitalization structure.\nPower\nAt Power, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. Power continues to move its fleet toward improved efficiency and believes that its investment program enhances its competitive position with the addition of efficient, clean, reliable combined cycle gas turbine capacity. Our commitments for load, such as basic generation service (BGS) in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contracts, are backed by this generation or may be combined with the use of physical commodity purchases and financial instruments from the market to optimize the economic efficiency of serving our obligations. Power's hedging practices and ability to capitalize on market opportunities help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than half of Power's expected gross margin in 2018 relates to our hedging strategy, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.\nOur investments in Keys Energy Center (Keys), Sewaren 7 and Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 5 (BH5) reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the Power business. These additions to our fleet both expand our geographic diversity and adjust our fuel mix and enhance the environmental profile and overall efficiency of Power's generation fleet.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. Flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving market as we remain diligent in managing costs. In 2018, our\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>utility achieved continued strong reliability and customer satisfaction results, as well as comprehensive storm preparation and restoration efforts, and ongoing cost control,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 56 terawatt hours while addressing fuel availability and price volatility, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>total nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 91.4%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Financial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2018 as we\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintained sufficient liquidity,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased our indicative annual dividend for 2018 to $1.80 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) without the issuance of new equity. For additional information on the impacts of the Tax Act, see Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Note 21. Income Taxes.\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and Power for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Millions, except per share data\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSE&G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG Net Income Per Share (Diluted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2018 over 2017 decrease in Net Income was due primarily to the one-time favorable impacts in 2017 of new tax legislation at Power and Holdings, discussed below, and the recognition in 2018 of net unrealized losses on NDT Fund equity securities at Power in accordance with new accounting guidance. The decrease was partially offset by charges in 2017 related to the early retirement of our Hudson and Mercer units, as well as a lower federal tax rate at Power and higher earnings from T&D investments and the favorable impact of new rates upon settlement of the distribution base rate proceeding, discussed above, at PSE&G. For a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see Results of Operations.\nDisciplined Investment\nWe utilize rigorous criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. These areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. In 2018, we\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>made additional investments in T&D infrastructure projects,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continued to execute our GSMP I, Energy Efficiency and other existing BPU-approved utility programs,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>received approval for our GSMP II program and filed our proposed ES II and CEF programs, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>commenced commercial operation of Sewaren 7 and Keys generation facilities and continued construction of our BH5 generation project, which is targeted for commercial operation in mid-2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Regulatory, Legislative and Other Developments\nIn our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. Transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. For additional information about regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect the company, see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues.\nTransmission Planning\nThere are several matters pending before FERC that may impact the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects, including those being constructed by PSE&G. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE&G's ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by customers in New Jersey. In addition, as a BGS supplier, Power provides services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these BGS-related transmission costs, BGS suppliers would be entitled to recovery, subject to BPU approval. We do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on Power's business or results of operations.\nSeveral complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners' base ROE. Certain of those complaints have resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners' base ROEs. The results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G.\nIn October 2018, FERC issued an order establishing a new framework for determining whether a company's ROE is unjust and unreasonable. FERC proposes to rely on financial models to establish a composite zone of reasonableness that will be used to determine whether an ROE complaint should be dismissed. If FERC determines that an ROE for a company is not just and reasonable, it intends to reset the ROE based on averaging the results of various financial models. We are still analyzing the potential impact of these methodologies and cannot predict the outcome of ongoing ROE proceedings.\nWholesale Power Market Design\nIn June 2018, FERC issued an order finding that PJM's current capacity market is not just and reasonable because it enabled state-supported resources to bid below their costs which resulted in suppressed clearing prices. In particular, FERC found that nuclear generating units that receive zero emission certificate (ZEC) payments were of concern. Depending on the outcome of this matter, our generating stations could also be impacted. For additional information see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues-Federal Regulation.\nIn February 2019, the PJM Board approved a filing to modify the curves used for pricing reserves with FERC. The reforms include a 30-minute reserve product in real-time, more dynamic reserve requirements to better capture operator actions taken to maintain reliability, and improvement to the curves used to price reserves during reserve shortage conditions. If placed into effect, this reform is expected to improve energy and reserve prices by ensuring that when operators commit resources to ensure reliability, the commitments are reflected in market clearing prices. However, this reform could result in lower capacity payments. There is no timeline for this type of filing and therefore we cannot predict when FERC will act on the filing or the outcome of this matter.\nIn October 2018, PJM filed with FERC to revise the shape of the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve that will be implemented for the capacity auction to be held in August 2019. The VRR curve is the administratively determined demand curve that serves as one of the key elements for establishing the amount of generation capacity to be procured in the auction. PJM contends that its proposal will lower capacity prices as compared to the currently effective VRR curve. PSEG protested PJM's proposal on the grounds that it would result in understated prices for capacity relative to the cost of constructing a new reference generating unit and will result in prices that are unjust and unreasonable. This matter is pending before FERC and we cannot predict the outcome.\nDistribution\nEffective in January 2018, the BPU adopted Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) regulations that encourage utilities to construct, install, or remediate utility plant and facilities related to reliability, resiliency, and/or safety to support the provision of safe and adequate service. Under these regulations, utilities can seek authority to make specified infrastructure investments in programs extending for up to five years with accelerated cost recovery mechanisms. The BPU characterized the IIP regulations as a regulatory initiative intended to create a financial incentive for utilities to accelerate the level of investment needed to promote the timely rehabilitation and replacement of certain traditional utility infrastructure that enhances reliability, resiliency, and/or safety. Since these regulations were adopted, the BPU approved our GSMP II and we filed our ES II and CEF-EC programs with the BPU.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the EPA and state environmental regulators. In particular, section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Implementation of Section 316(b) and related state regulations could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs.\nIn August 2018, the EPA released the proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as a replacement for the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The proposed ACE rule gives states great flexibility to evaluate specific heat rate improvement technologies and practices to be applied at coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years from the date of finalization to submit a plan that establishes a standard of performance that reflects the degree of emission limitation through the application of heat rate improvement technologies and practices. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nWe are also subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material.\nIn December 2018, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection proposed two rules that begin the state's re-entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The first proposal is the mechanism rulemaking that establishes the state's initial cap on greenhouse gas emissions of 18 million tons in 2020. The proposal follows the RGGI model rule with a cap that will decline three percent annually through 2030 to a final cap of 11.5 million tons. New Jersey is committed to a start date of January 1, 2020. The second proposal establishes the framework for how the state will spend the RGGI auction proceeds. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nFor further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\nEarly Plant Retirements\nNuclear\nIn May 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed legislation, referred to as the ZEC legislation, that recognizes that nuclear power is a critical component of New Jersey's clean energy portfolio and an important element of a diverse energy generation portfolio that currently meets approximately 40 percent of New Jersey's electric power needs. The ZEC legislation creates a Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) program to be administered by the BPU. The BPU subsequently established processes to evaluate applications by qualified nuclear plants and to review and approve changes to the New Jersey's electric distribution companies' tariffs to provide for the purchase of ZECs from selected nuclear plants and recover those ZEC payments through a non-bypassable distribution charge (ZEC charge) in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per megawatt hour (MWh) in payments to selected nuclear plants. ZECs will be awarded to selected nuclear plants, if any, in April 2019 at which time ZEC revenue would commence and would continue for approximately three years. Nuclear plants receiving ZEC payments will be obligated to maintain operations, subject to exceptions specified in the ZEC legislation. The ZEC legislation requires nuclear plants to reapply for any subsequent three year periods. The ZEC payment may be adjusted by the BPU (a) at any time to offset environmental or fuel diversity payments that a selected nuclear plant may receive from another source or (b) at certain times specified in the ZEC legislation if the BPU determines that the purposes of the ZEC legislation can be achieved through a reduced charge that will nonetheless be sufficient to achieve the state's air quality and other environmental objectives by preventing the retirement of nuclear plants.\nIn December 2018, Power submitted applications to the BPU for the Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants. These were the only applications received by the BPU. As required, Power's three applications each included a certification pursuant to which Power confirmed that each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants will cease operations within three years absent a material financial change. Power's submittal further attested that the nuclear plants are not expected to cover their costs and operating and market risks as defined in the ZEC legislation, absent a material financial change. As a result, absent a material financial change, Power will retire all three plants unless all of the plants receive ZECs. Power operates its nuclear plants as an interdependent fleet on a common site with shared costs and services, which allows them to achieve economies of scale. A decision to retire one nuclear plant would also adversely impact Power's ability to attract and retain qualified employees at its remaining plants. Power believes that the retirement of any individual nuclear plant would have the effect of decreasing the scale of its nuclear operations; however, the complex nature of operating nuclear plants would not decrease the attention required from management for the safe operation of the remaining nuclear operations. As a result, Power's decision to retire any nuclear plant would be made at the site level and would result in the retirement of all of these New Jersey nuclear plants.\nGiven the anticipated timing of the BPU's decision on which nuclear plants, if any, have been selected to receive ZECs, which is expected in April 2019, in March 2019 Power will submit to the PJM Independent Market Monitor and the PJM Office of Interconnection a request for a preliminary exception to PJM's Reliability Pricing Model must-offer requirement with respect to Power's interest for each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants in connection with the 2022/2023 capacity auction expected to be held in August 2019. Power will also submit a deactivation notice to the extent that its filing deadline occurs prior to the award of ZECs by the BPU. If all of the Salem and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZECs, the preliminary exception and requested deactivation notice, as applicable, would be withdrawn.\nIn the event that any of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants is not selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 by the BPU and do not otherwise experience a material financial change, Power will take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants at or prior to their refueling outages scheduled for the Fall 2019 in the case of Hope Creek, Spring 2020 in the case of Salem 2 and Fall 2020 in the case of Salem 1. Alternatively, if all of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 but the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by potential changes to the capacity market construct being considered by FERC (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the BPU in accordance with a FERC authorized capacity mechanism), Power would still take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants. The costs and accounting charges associated with any such retirement, which may include, among other things, accelerated depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, potential penalties associated with the early termination of capacity obligations and fuel contracts, accelerated asset retirement costs, severance costs, environmental remediation costs and, in certain circumstances, potential additional funding of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund, would be material to both PSEG and Power.\nFollowing any action to retire its nuclear plants, Power would take the necessary steps to satisfy its capacity obligations through 2022 with other assets in its fleet or through market purchases. Power intends to decommission any retired nuclear plant using the SAFESTOR\u201d process, which is a process approved by the NRC. As a result, Power believes adequate funds are available in the NDT Fund for the early retirement of the nuclear plants. To the extent another decommissioning process is employed, the NDT Fund would not be sufficient to cover the costs of decommissioning all the nuclear plants upon early retirement.\nFossil\nIn December 2018, Power completed the sale of the sites of the retired Hudson and Mercer units. Power transferred all land rights and structures on the sites to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for the sites. As a result of the sale and transfer of liabilities, Power recorded a pre-tax gain in 2018 of $54 million in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Expense.\nIn addition, PSEG and Power continue to monitor their other coal assets, including their interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations, to assess their economic viability through the end of their designated useful lives and their continued classification as held for use. The precise timing of a change in useful lives may be dependent upon events out of PSEG's and Power's control and may impact their ability to operate or maintain certain assets in the future. These generating stations may be impacted by factors such as environmental legislation, co-owner capital requirements and continued depressed wholesale power prices or capacity factors, among other things. Any early retirement or change in the classification as held for use of our remaining coal units may have a material adverse impact on PSEG's and Power's future financial results.\nCalifornia Solar Facilities\nAs part of its solar production portfolio, Power owns and operates two California-based solar facilities with an aggregate capacity of approximately 30 MW direct current whose output is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) under power purchase agreements (PPAs) with twenty year terms. The net book value of these solar facilities was approximately $57 million as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, PG&E and its parent company PG&E Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Power cannot predict the ultimate outcome that this bankruptcy proceeding will have on our ability to collect all of the future revenues from these facilities due under the PPAs; however, any adverse changes to the terms of Power's PPAs as a result of this bankruptcy proceeding could result in the future impairment of these assets in amounts up to their current net book value.\nOffshore Wind\nIn January 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed Executive Order No. 8 directing the BPU to begin the process of moving the state toward its 2030 goal of 3,500 MW of offshore wind energy generation. An initial solicitation was established for 1,100 MW of offshore wind, with bids due in December 2018. In connection with the bid submitted by Ocean Wind, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of \u00d8rsted US Offshore Wind, referred to as the Ocean Wind project, PSEG agreed to provide energy management services and the potential lease of land for use in project development. We also retained an option to acquire an equity interest in the project. We expect to make a decision regarding an equity investment in the Ocean Wind project in the second half of 2019.\nLeveraged Leases\nIn December 2018, NRG REMA, LLC (REMA) emerged from its in-court proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Upon emergence, PSEG received $31.5 million in cash in exchange for transferring the ownership interests in Keystone and Conemaugh to the debtholders of REMA and satisfaction of all other claims asserted against REMA, as well as certain amendments to the Shawville lease. The Shawville lease amendments, among other things, will allow REMA to express interest in a renewal on or after November 24, 2019. In addition, REMA has agreed to fund qualifying credit support up to $36 million. As a result of the restructuring, Energy Holdings recognized a pre-tax gain in Operating Revenues of approximately $12 million ($9 million after tax). In addition, the remaining deferred tax liabilities related to these lease investments were reclassified to current tax liabilities. PSEG expects to pay approximately $120 million to taxing authorities resulting from this restructuring activity.\nAdditional facilities in our leveraged lease portfolio include the Joliet and Powerton generating facilities. Converted natural gas units such as Shawville and Joliet may have higher operating costs and fuel consumption, as well as longer start-up times, compared to newer combined cycle gas units. Powerton is a coal-fired generating facility in Illinois. Each of these three facilities may not be as economically competitive as newer combined cycle gas units and could continue to be adversely impacted by the same economic conditions experienced by other less efficient natural gas and coal generation facilities, which could require Energy Holdings to write down the residual value of the leveraged lease receivables associated with these facilities.\nTax Legislation\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act, among other things, decreased the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and made certain changes to bonus depreciation and interest disallowance rules.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time, non-cash earnings benefit of $745 million in 2017, including $588 million related to Power and $147 million related to Energy Holdings. This benefit was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. In addition, PSE&G recorded excess deferred taxes of approximately $2.1 billion and recorded an approximate $2.9 billion revenue impact of these excess deferred taxes as Regulatory Liabilities.\nBeginning in 2018, PSEG, on a consolidated basis, is incurring lower income tax expense resulting in a decrease in its effective income tax rate that has led to an increase in PSEG's and Power's Net Income. To the extent allowed under the Tax Act, Power's operating cash flows will reflect the full expensing of capital investments for income tax purposes. For PSE&G, the Tax Act has led to lower customer rates due to lower income tax expense recoveries and the BPU and FERC have approved our proposal to refund excess deferred income tax Regulatory Liabilities. See Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate on PSE&G was reflected in PSE&G's distribution base rate proceeding and its 2018 transmission formula rate filings. The Tax Act is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for PSE&G resulting from the elimination of bonus depreciation, partially offset by higher revenues due to the higher rate base.\nIn August 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) regarding the application of tax depreciation rules as amended by the Tax Act. While the Notice provides some guidance as to the application of the changes made by the Tax Act to the bonus depreciation rules, certain aspects remain unclear. Further, in November 2018 the IRS issued Proposed Regulations addressing the interest disallowance rules contained in the Tax Act. For non-regulated businesses, these rules set a cap on the amount of interest that can be deducted in a given year. Any amount that is disallowed can be carried forward indefinitely. For 2018, PSEG and Power expect that a portion of their interest will be disallowed in the current period but realized in future periods. However, certain aspects of the proposed regulations are unclear; therefore, we recorded taxes based on our interpretation of the relevant statute.\nWe recorded amounts based on our interpretation of the Tax Act, the depreciation rules contained in the Notice and proposed interest disallowance regulations. Such amounts are subject to change based on several factors, including but not limited to, the IRS and state taxing authorities issuing final guidance and/or further clarification. Any further guidance or clarification could impact PSEG's, PSE&G's and Power's financial statements. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 21. Income Taxes.\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, various state regulatory authorities, including the BPU, have taken action to ensure that excess federal income taxes previously collected in rates are returned to customers. We adjusted the revenue requirement in certain of our rate matters as a result of the change in the federal income tax rate. See Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information.\nIn July 2018, the State of New Jersey made changes to its income tax laws, including imposing a temporary surtax on allocated corporate taxable income of 2.5% effective January 1, 2018 and 2019 and 1.5% in 2020 and 2021, as well as requiring corporate taxpayers to file in a combined reporting group as defined under New Jersey law starting in 2019. Both provisions include an exemption for public utilities. We believe PSE&G meets the definition of a public utility and, therefore, will not be impacted by the temporary surtax or be included in the combined reporting group. We expect these new provisions to unfavorably affect our non-utility business. In accordance with GAAP accounting for income taxes, deferred taxes are required to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred taxes are expected to settle. The newly enacted New Jersey tax legislation did not have a material impact on PSEG's deferred income tax balance.\nAmendments to Other Postretirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) Plans\nIn December 2018, PSEG amended certain provisions of its OPEB plans applicable to all current and future Medicare-eligible retirees and spouses who receive or will receive subsidized healthcare from PSEG. Effective January 1, 2021, the PSEG-sponsored Medicare-eligible plans will be replaced by a Medicare private exchange. For each Medicare-eligible retiree and spouse, PSEG will provide annual credits to a Health Reimbursement Arrangement, which can be used to pay for medical, prescription drug, and dental plan premiums, as well as certain out-of-pocket costs. The amendment resulted in a $559 million reduction in PSEG's OPEB obligation as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to decrease net periodic benefit costs in 2019.\nFuture Outlook\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in an environment with low gas prices, to capitalize on or otherwise address regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below.

material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.\nFinancing Methodology\nWe expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.\nPSE&G's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year revolving credit facility. PSE&G uses internally generated cash flow and its commercial paper program to meet seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. PSE&G does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. PSE&G maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. PSE&G's dividend payments to/capital contributions from PSEG are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. PSE&G's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. Generally, PSE&G uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.\nPSEG, Power, Energy Holdings, PSEG LI and Services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs. Servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. Servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by LIPA.\nPSEG's sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness under credit facilities. Our current sources of external liquidity include multi-year revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. These facilities are available to back-stop PSEG's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. These facilities may also be used to provide support to PSEG's subsidiaries. PSEG's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support PSEG working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. PSEG also has $1.1 billion of term loan credit agreements, of which $350 million is scheduled to expire in June 2019 and $700 million in November 2020. From time to time, PSEG may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries.\nPower's sources of external liquidity include $2.1 billion of multi-year revolving credit facilities. Additionally, from time to time, Power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. Credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of Power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event that Power is downgraded to below investment grade by Standard & Poor's (S&P) or Moody's. Power's dividend payments to PSEG are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. Generally, Power issues senior unsecured debt to raise long-term capital.\nOperating Cash Flows\nWe expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our operating cash flow decreased by $347 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our operating cash flow decreased by $53 million. The net changes were primarily due to net changes from our subsidiaries as discussed below and net tax payments at Energy Holdings in 2018 as compared to tax refunds in 2017.\nPSE&G\nPSE&G's operating cash flow increased $15 million from $1,838 million to $1,853 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase of $171 million relating to accounts receivable and unbilled revenues resulting from higher collections and lower prices and volumes in 2018 and higher earnings, offset by tax payments in 2018 as compared to tax refunds in 2017.\nPSE&G's operating cash flow decreased $58 million from $1,896 million to $1,838 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to lower tax refunds and a decrease of $50 million related to a change in regulatory deferrals. These amounts were partially offset by higher earnings and $30 million in decreased vendor payments.\nPower\nPower's operating cash flow decreased $242 million from $1,326 million to $1,084 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017, due to an increase in margin deposit requirements of $157 million, lower earnings, a decrease in fuels, materials and supplies of $81 million and an increase of $52 million in payments to counterparties, offset by tax refunds in 2018 as compared to tax payments in 2017, and a $96 million increase from net collections of counterparty receivables.\nPower's operating cash flow increased $71 million from $1,255 million to $1,326 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily resulting from a decrease of $61 million in payments to counterparties, a $26 million increase from higher net collections of counterparty receivables, and higher earnings. These amounts were partially offset by higher tax payments and an increase in margin deposit requirements of $14 million.\nShort-Term Liquidity\nPSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of Power, primarily with cash and through the issuance of commercial paper. PSE&G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facilities.\nWe continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. Each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs. Our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Company/Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\nFacility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Usage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nLiquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSE&G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. Our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of Power losing its investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody's, which would represent a three level downgrade from its current S&P or Moody's ratings. In the event of a deterioration of Power's credit rating, certain of Power's agreements allow the counterparty to demand further performance assurance. The potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately $857 million and $848 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Item 8. Note 15. Debt and Credit Facilities.\nLong-Term Debt Financing\nDuring the next twelve months, PSEG has a $350 million floating rate term loan maturing in June 2019 and $400 million of 1.60% Senior Notes maturing in November 2019. PSE&G has $250 million of 1.80% Medium Term Notes maturing in June 2019 and $250 million of 2.00% Medium Term Notes maturing in August 2019. Power has a letter of credit backing $44 million of Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority Variable Rate Demand Bonds which expires in November 2019.\nFor a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during 2018, see Item 8. Note 15. Debt and Credit Facilities.\nDebt Covenants\nOur credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.\nIn addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2018, PSE&G's Mortgage coverage ratio was 3.8 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $6.3 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.\nDefault Provisions\nOur bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company's agreement.\nIn particular, PSEG's bank credit agreements contain provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under PSE&G's and Power's respective financing agreements, a failure by PSE&G or Power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by PSE&G or Power, that would constitute an event of default under the PSEG bank credit agreements. Under the PSEG bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if either PSE&G or Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. The PSE&G and Power bank credit agreements include similar default provisions; however, such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. The PSE&G and Power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to PSEG. Power's bank credit agreements and outstanding notes also contain limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt and liens and certain of Power's outstanding notes require Power to repurchase such notes upon certain change of control events.\nThere are no cross acceleration provisions in PSEG's or PSE&G's indentures. However, PSEG's existing notes include a cross acceleration provision that may be triggered upon the acceleration of more than $75 million of indebtedness incurred by PSEG. Such provision does not extend to an acceleration of indebtedness by any of PSEG's subsidiaries. Power's indenture includes a cross acceleration provision similar to that described above for PSEG's existing notes except that such provision may be triggered upon the acceleration of more than $50 million of indebtedness incurred by Power or any of its subsidiaries. Such provision does not cross accelerate to PSEG, any of PSEG's subsidiaries (other than Power and its subsidiaries), PSE&G or any of PSE&G's subsidiaries.\nRatings Triggers\nOur debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material ratings triggers\u201d that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. In the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.\nIn accordance with BPU requirements under the BGS contracts, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of Power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase Power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade by S&P or Moody's at today's market prices.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Dividend Payments on Common Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>in Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 19, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a $0.47 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2019. This reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $1.88 per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see Item 8. Note 23. Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividends.\nCredit Ratings\nIf the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. Credit Ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. Outlooks are shown for Corporate Credit Ratings (S&P) and Issuer Credit Ratings (Moody's) and can\nbe Stable, Negative, or Positive. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's (A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P (B)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>P2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSE&G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Bonds\n</td> <td>Aa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>P1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Moody's ratings range from Aaa (highest) to C (lowest) for long-term securities and P1 (highest) to NP (lowest) for short-term securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>S&P ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long-term securities and A1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short-term securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Other Comprehensive Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had Other Comprehensive Income of $28 million on a consolidated basis. Other Comprehensive Income was due primarily to an increase of $46 million related to pension and other postretirement benefits, partially offset by $17 million of net unrealized losses related to Available-for-Sale Securities and $1 million of unrealized losses on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges. See Item 8. Note 22. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax for additional information.\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. Projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below.

See Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further discussion.\nThrough Energy Holdings, we have investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with GAAP Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease arrangement, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secures the loan. As a lessor, Energy Holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operations. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 8. Long-Term Investments and Note 9. Financing Receivables.\nIn the event that collection of the minimum lease payments to be received by Energy Holdings is no longer reasonably assured, Energy Holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. In the event the lease is ultimately rejected by the lessee in a Bankruptcy Court proceeding, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.\nAccounting for Pensions\nPSEG sponsors qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering PSEG's and its participating affiliates' current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. The market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension plan is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. The plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We calculate pension costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used: Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns.\nTable 300: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, our measurement date. The discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. The discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.\nOur expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class, long-term inflation assumptions and a premium for active management.\nBased on the above assumptions, we have estimated a net periodic pension expense in 2019 of approximately $49 million, or $11 million, net of amounts capitalized.\nWe utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported pension expense/income. The corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of expense/income. This occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. The excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is approximately fourteen years.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used: As part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming a 7.80% expected rate of return and a 4.41% discount rate for 2019 expense. Actual future pension expense/income and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans.\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Pension\nBenefit Obligation as of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase to Pension Expense in 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase to\nPension Expense, net of Amounts Capitalized\nin 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee", "summary": "The MD&A report discusses the financial condition and operations of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and its subsidiaries, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) and PSEG Power LLC.

PSE&G and Power each make representations only as to itself and make no representations whatsoever as to any other company.\nPSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n \u2022 PSE&G-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and \n \u2022 Power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its power marketing businesses and fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, Power owns and operates solar generation in various states. Power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states in which they operate.  PSEG's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement; PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which primarily has investments in leveraged leases; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nOur business discussion in Item 1. Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2018 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2018 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nOur business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing system reliability and resiliency, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy projects. Over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. Over the next five years, we expect to invest between $11 billion and $16 billion in our business which is expected to provide an annual rate base growth of 7%-9%. We completed our Energy Strong Program I (ES I) and essentially completed our Gas System Modernization Program I (GSMP I). See Item 1. Business-Business Operations and Strategy-PSE&G for a description of these programs.\nIn May 2018, we received approval for our Gas System Modernization Program II (GSMP II), an expanded, five-year program to invest $1.9 billion beginning in 2019 to replace approximately 875 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains in addition to other improvements to the gas system. Approximately $1.6 billion will be recovered through periodic rate roll-ins, with the remaining $300 million to be recovered through a future base rate proceeding. As part of the settlement, PSE&G agreed to file a base rate proceeding no later than five years from the commencement of the program, to maintain a base level of gas distribution capital expenditures of $155 million per year and to achieve certain leak reduction targets.\nIn June 2018, we filed for our Energy Strong Program II (ES II), a proposed five-year $2.5 billion program to harden, modernize and make our electric and gas distribution systems more resilient. The size and duration of ES II, as well as certain other elements of the program, are subject to BPU approval. The review process is expected to conclude in mid-2019.\nIn October 2018, we filed our proposed Clean Energy Future (CEF) program with the BPU, a six-year estimated $3.6 billion investment covering four programs; (i) an Energy Efficiency (EE) program totaling $2.5 billion of investment designed to\nachieve energy efficiency targets required under New Jersey's Clean Energy law; (ii) an Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure program; (iii) an Energy Storage (ES) program and (iv) an Energy Cloud (EC) program which will include installing approximately two million electric smart meters and associated infrastructure. The review process for the CEF-EE program is expected to conclude by the third quarter of 2019. The CEF-EV/ ES and CEF-EC programs will have separate procedural schedules.\nIn November 2018, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (Rate Counsel) filed a motion to dismiss the CEF-EC filing on the basis that the BPU announced a moratorium on electric distribution companies' AMI program. In December 2018, Rate Counsel filed a motion to stay the CEF-EV/ES filing, arguing that the BPU should conclude other regulatory proceedings addressing EVs and ES, including the new Energy Master Plan and initiatives required by the Clean Energy Act, before it rules on PSE&G's program. We opposed Rate Counsel's motions, asking for the BPU to permit these filings to proceed. There is no timetable for the BPU to decide on Rate Counsel's motions.\nAlso, in October 2018, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our distribution base rate proceeding with new rates effective November 1, 2018. The settlement resulted in a net reduction in overall annual revenues of approximately $13 million, comprised of a $212 million increase in base revenues, which includes the recovery of deferred storm costs, and the return of tax benefits largely due to tax reform of approximately $225 million. The Order provides for a distribution rate base of $9.5 billion, a 9.6% return on equity (ROE) for our distribution business and a 54% equity component of our capitalization structure.\nPower\nAt Power, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. Power continues to move its fleet toward improved efficiency and believes that its investment program enhances its competitive position with the addition of efficient, clean, reliable combined cycle gas turbine capacity. Our commitments for load, such as basic generation service (BGS) in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contracts, are backed by this generation or may be combined with the use of physical commodity purchases and financial instruments from the market to optimize the economic efficiency of serving our obligations. Power's hedging practices and ability to capitalize on market opportunities help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than half of Power's expected gross margin in 2018 relates to our hedging strategy, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.\nOur investments in Keys Energy Center (Keys), Sewaren 7 and Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 5 (BH5) reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the Power business. These additions to our fleet both expand our geographic diversity and adjust our fuel mix and enhance the environmental profile and overall efficiency of Power's generation fleet.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. Flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving market as we remain diligent in managing costs. In 2018, our\n \u2022 utility achieved continued strong reliability and customer satisfaction results, as well as comprehensive storm preparation and restoration efforts, and ongoing cost control, \n \u2022 diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 56 terawatt hours while addressing fuel availability and price volatility, and \n \u2022 total nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 91.4%.  Financial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2018 as we\n \u2022 maintained sufficient liquidity, \n \u2022 maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and \n \u2022 increased our indicative annual dividend for 2018 to $1.80 per share.  We expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) without the issuance of new equity. For additional information on the impacts of the Tax Act, see Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Note 21. Income Taxes.\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and Power for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:\n\nOur 2018 over 2017 decrease in Net Income was due primarily to the one-time favorable impacts in 2017 of new tax legislation at Power and Holdings, discussed below, and the recognition in 2018 of net unrealized losses on NDT Fund equity securities at Power in accordance with new accounting guidance. The decrease was partially offset by charges in 2017 related to the early retirement of our Hudson and Mercer units, as well as a lower federal tax rate at Power and higher earnings from T&D investments and the favorable impact of new rates upon settlement of the distribution base rate proceeding, discussed above, at PSE&G. For a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see Results of Operations.\nDisciplined Investment\nWe utilize rigorous criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. These areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. In 2018, we\n \u2022 made additional investments in T&D infrastructure projects, \n \u2022 continued to execute our GSMP I, Energy Efficiency and other existing BPU-approved utility programs, \n \u2022 received approval for our GSMP II program and filed our proposed ES II and CEF programs, and \n \u2022 commenced commercial operation of Sewaren 7 and Keys generation facilities and continued construction of our BH5 generation project, which is targeted for commercial operation in mid-2019.  Regulatory, Legislative and Other Developments\nIn our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. Transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. For additional information about regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect the company, see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues.\nTransmission Planning\nThere are several matters pending before FERC that may impact the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects, including those being constructed by PSE&G. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE&G's ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by customers in New Jersey. In addition, as a BGS supplier, Power provides services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these BGS-related transmission costs, BGS suppliers would be entitled to recovery, subject to BPU approval. We do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on Power's business or results of operations.\nSeveral complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners' base ROE. Certain of those complaints have resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners' base ROEs. The results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G.\nIn October 2018, FERC issued an order establishing a new framework for determining whether a company's ROE is unjust and unreasonable. FERC proposes to rely on financial models to establish a composite zone of reasonableness that will be used to determine whether an ROE complaint should be dismissed. If FERC determines that an ROE for a company is not just and reasonable, it intends to reset the ROE based on averaging the results of various financial models. We are still analyzing the potential impact of these methodologies and cannot predict the outcome of ongoing ROE proceedings.\nWholesale Power Market Design\nIn June 2018, FERC issued an order finding that PJM's current capacity market is not just and reasonable because it enabled state-supported resources to bid below their costs which resulted in suppressed clearing prices. In particular, FERC found that nuclear generating units that receive zero emission certificate (ZEC) payments were of concern. Depending on the outcome of this matter, our generating stations could also be impacted. For additional information see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues-Federal Regulation.\nIn February 2019, the PJM Board approved a filing to modify the curves used for pricing reserves with FERC. The reforms include a 30-minute reserve product in real-time, more dynamic reserve requirements to better capture operator actions taken to maintain reliability, and improvement to the curves used to price reserves during reserve shortage conditions. If placed into effect, this reform is expected to improve energy and reserve prices by ensuring that when operators commit resources to ensure reliability, the commitments are reflected in market clearing prices. However, this reform could result in lower capacity payments. There is no timeline for this type of filing and therefore we cannot predict when FERC will act on the filing or the outcome of this matter.\nIn October 2018, PJM filed with FERC to revise the shape of the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve that will be implemented for the capacity auction to be held in August 2019. The VRR curve is the administratively determined demand curve that serves as one of the key elements for establishing the amount of generation capacity to be procured in the auction. PJM contends that its proposal will lower capacity prices as compared to the currently effective VRR curve. PSEG protested PJM's proposal on the grounds that it would result in understated prices for capacity relative to the cost of constructing a new reference generating unit and will result in prices that are unjust and unreasonable. This matter is pending before FERC and we cannot predict the outcome.\nDistribution\nEffective in January 2018, the BPU adopted Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) regulations that encourage utilities to construct, install, or remediate utility plant and facilities related to reliability, resiliency, and/or safety to support the provision of safe and adequate service. Under these regulations, utilities can seek authority to make specified infrastructure investments in programs extending for up to five years with accelerated cost recovery mechanisms. The BPU characterized the IIP regulations as a regulatory initiative intended to create a financial incentive for utilities to accelerate the level of investment needed to promote the timely rehabilitation and replacement of certain traditional utility infrastructure that enhances reliability, resiliency, and/or safety. Since these regulations were adopted, the BPU approved our GSMP II and we filed our ES II and CEF-EC programs with the BPU.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the EPA and state environmental regulators. In particular, section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Implementation of Section 316(b) and related state regulations could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs.\nIn August 2018, the EPA released the proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as a replacement for the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The proposed ACE rule gives states great flexibility to evaluate specific heat rate improvement technologies and practices to be applied at coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years from the date of finalization to submit a plan that establishes a standard of performance that reflects the degree of emission limitation through the application of heat rate improvement technologies and practices. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nWe are also subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material.\nIn December 2018, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection proposed two rules that begin the state's re-entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The first proposal is the mechanism rulemaking that establishes the state's initial cap on greenhouse gas emissions of 18 million tons in 2020. The proposal follows the RGGI model rule with a cap that will decline three percent annually through 2030 to a final cap of 11.5 million tons. New Jersey is committed to a start date of January 1, 2020. The second proposal establishes the framework for how the state will spend the RGGI auction proceeds. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nFor further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\nEarly Plant Retirements\nNuclear\nIn May 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed legislation, referred to as the ZEC legislation, that recognizes that nuclear power is a critical component of New Jersey's clean energy portfolio and an important element of a diverse energy generation portfolio that currently meets approximately 40 percent of New Jersey's electric power needs. The ZEC legislation creates a Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) program to be administered by the BPU. The BPU subsequently established processes to evaluate applications by qualified nuclear plants and to review and approve changes to the New Jersey's electric distribution companies' tariffs to provide for the purchase of ZECs from selected nuclear plants and recover those ZEC payments through a non-bypassable distribution charge (ZEC charge) in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per megawatt hour (MWh) in payments to selected nuclear plants. ZECs will be awarded to selected nuclear plants, if any, in April 2019 at which time ZEC revenue would commence and would continue for approximately three years. Nuclear plants receiving ZEC payments will be obligated to maintain operations, subject to exceptions specified in the ZEC legislation. The ZEC legislation requires nuclear plants to reapply for any subsequent three year periods. The ZEC payment may be adjusted by the BPU (a) at any time to offset environmental or fuel diversity payments that a selected nuclear plant may receive from another source or (b) at certain times specified in the ZEC legislation if the BPU determines that the purposes of the ZEC legislation can be achieved through a reduced charge that will nonetheless be sufficient to achieve the state's air quality and other environmental objectives by preventing the retirement of nuclear plants.\nIn December 2018, Power submitted applications to the BPU for the Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants. These were the only applications received by the BPU. As required, Power's three applications each included a certification pursuant to which Power confirmed that each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants will cease operations within three years absent a material financial change. Power's submittal further attested that the nuclear plants are not expected to cover their costs and operating and market risks as defined in the ZEC legislation, absent a material financial change. As a result, absent a material financial change, Power will retire all three plants unless all of the plants receive ZECs. Power operates its nuclear plants as an interdependent fleet on a common site with shared costs and services, which allows them to achieve economies of scale. A decision to retire one nuclear plant would also adversely impact Power's ability to attract and retain qualified employees at its remaining plants. Power believes that the retirement of any individual nuclear plant would have the effect of decreasing the scale of its nuclear operations; however, the complex nature of operating nuclear plants would not decrease the attention required from management for the safe operation of the remaining nuclear operations. As a result, Power's decision to retire any nuclear plant would be made at the site level and would result in the retirement of all of these New Jersey nuclear plants.\nGiven the anticipated timing of the BPU's decision on which nuclear plants, if any, have been selected to receive ZECs, which is expected in April 2019, in March 2019 Power will submit to the PJM Independent Market Monitor and the PJM Office of Interconnection a request for a preliminary exception to PJM's Reliability Pricing Model must-offer requirement with respect to Power's interest for each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants in connection with the 2022/2023 capacity auction expected to be held in August 2019. Power will also submit a deactivation notice to the extent that its filing deadline occurs prior to the award of ZECs by the BPU. If all of the Salem and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZECs, the preliminary exception and requested deactivation notice, as applicable, would be withdrawn.\nIn the event that any of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants is not selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 by the BPU and do not otherwise experience a material financial change, Power will take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants at or prior to their refueling outages scheduled for the Fall 2019 in the case of Hope Creek, Spring 2020 in the case of Salem 2 and Fall 2020 in the case of Salem 1. Alternatively, if all of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 but the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by potential changes to the capacity market construct being considered by FERC (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the BPU in accordance with a FERC authorized capacity mechanism), Power would still take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants. The costs and accounting charges associated with any such retirement, which may include, among other things, accelerated depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, potential penalties associated with the early termination of capacity obligations and fuel contracts, accelerated asset retirement costs, severance costs, environmental remediation costs and, in certain circumstances, potential additional funding of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund, would be material to both PSEG and Power.\nFollowing any action to retire its nuclear plants, Power would take the necessary steps to satisfy its capacity obligations through 2022 with other assets in its fleet or through market purchases. Power intends to decommission any retired nuclear plant using the SAFESTOR\u201d process, which is a process approved by the NRC. As a result, Power believes adequate funds are available in the NDT Fund for the early retirement of the nuclear plants. To the extent another decommissioning process is employed, the NDT Fund would not be sufficient to cover the costs of decommissioning all the nuclear plants upon early retirement.\nFossil\nIn December 2018, Power completed the sale of the sites of the retired Hudson and Mercer units. Power transferred all land rights and structures on the sites to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for the sites. As a result of the sale and transfer of liabilities, Power recorded a pre-tax gain in 2018 of $54 million in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Expense.\nIn addition, PSEG and Power continue to monitor their other coal assets, including their interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations, to assess their economic viability through the end of their designated useful lives and their continued classification as held for use. The precise timing of a change in useful lives may be dependent upon events out of PSEG's and Power's control and may impact their ability to operate or maintain certain assets in the future. These generating stations may be impacted by factors such as environmental legislation, co-owner capital requirements and continued depressed wholesale power prices or capacity factors, among other things. Any early retirement or change in the classification as held for use of our remaining coal units may have a material adverse impact on PSEG's and Power's future financial results.\nCalifornia Solar Facilities\nAs part of its solar production portfolio, Power owns and operates two California-based solar facilities with an aggregate capacity of approximately 30 MW direct current whose output is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) under power purchase agreements (PPAs) with twenty year terms. The net book value of these solar facilities was approximately $57 million as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, PG&E and its parent company PG&E Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Power cannot predict the ultimate outcome that this bankruptcy proceeding will have on our ability to collect all of the future revenues from these facilities due under the PPAs; however, any adverse changes to the terms of Power's PPAs as a result of this bankruptcy proceeding could result in the future impairment of these assets in amounts up to their current net book value.\nOffshore Wind\nIn January 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed Executive Order No. 8 directing the BPU to begin the process of moving the state toward its 2030 goal of 3,500 MW of offshore wind energy generation. An initial solicitation was established for 1,100 MW of offshore wind, with bids due in December 2018. In connection with the bid submitted by Ocean Wind, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of \u00d8rsted US Offshore Wind, referred to as the Ocean Wind project, PSEG agreed to provide energy management services and the potential lease of land for use in project development. We also retained an option to acquire an equity interest in the project. We expect to make a decision regarding an equity investment in the Ocean Wind project in the second half of 2019.\nLeveraged Leases\nIn December 2018, NRG REMA, LLC (REMA) emerged from its in-court proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Upon emergence, PSEG received $31.5 million in cash in exchange for transferring the ownership interests in Keystone and Conemaugh to the debtholders of REMA and satisfaction of all other claims asserted against REMA, as well as certain amendments to the Shawville lease. The Shawville lease amendments, among other things, will allow REMA to express interest in a renewal on or after November 24, 2019. In addition, REMA has agreed to fund qualifying credit support up to $36 million. As a result of the restructuring, Energy Holdings recognized a pre-tax gain in Operating Revenues of approximately $12 million ($9 million after tax). In addition, the remaining deferred tax liabilities related to these lease investments were reclassified to current tax liabilities. PSEG expects to pay approximately $120 million to taxing authorities resulting from this restructuring activity.\nAdditional facilities in our leveraged lease portfolio include the Joliet and Powerton generating facilities. Converted natural gas units such as Shawville and Joliet may have higher operating costs and fuel consumption, as well as longer start-up times, compared to newer combined cycle gas units. Powerton is a coal-fired generating facility in Illinois. Each of these three facilities may not be as economically competitive as newer combined cycle gas units and could continue to be adversely impacted by the same economic conditions experienced by other less efficient natural gas and coal generation facilities, which could require Energy Holdings to write down the residual value of the leveraged lease receivables associated with these facilities.\nTax Legislation\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act, among other things, decreased the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and made certain changes to bonus depreciation and interest disallowance rules.\nAs a result", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThis combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) and PSEG Power LLC (Power). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. PSE&G and Power each make representations only as to itself and make no representations whatsoever as to any other company.\nPSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n \u2022 PSE&G-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and \n \u2022 Power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its power marketing businesses and fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, Power owns and operates solar generation in various states. Power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states in which they operate.  PSEG's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement; PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which primarily has investments in leveraged leases; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nOur business discussion in Item 1. Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2018 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2018 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nOur business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing system reliability and resiliency, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy projects. Over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G. Over the next five years, we expect to invest between $11 billion and $16 billion in our business which is expected to provide an annual rate base growth of 7%-9%. We completed our Energy Strong Program I (ES I) and essentially completed our Gas System Modernization Program I (GSMP I). See Item 1. Business-Business Operations and Strategy-PSE&G for a description of these programs.\nIn May 2018, we received approval for our Gas System Modernization Program II (GSMP II), an expanded, five-year program to invest $1.9 billion beginning in 2019 to replace approximately 875 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains in addition to other improvements to the gas system. Approximately $1.6 billion will be recovered through periodic rate roll-ins, with the remaining $300 million to be recovered through a future base rate proceeding. As part of the settlement, PSE&G agreed to file a base rate proceeding no later than five years from the commencement of the program, to maintain a base level of gas distribution capital expenditures of $155 million per year and to achieve certain leak reduction targets.\nIn June 2018, we filed for our Energy Strong Program II (ES II), a proposed five-year $2.5 billion program to harden, modernize and make our electric and gas distribution systems more resilient. The size and duration of ES II, as well as certain other elements of the program, are subject to BPU approval. The review process is expected to conclude in mid-2019.\nIn October 2018, we filed our proposed Clean Energy Future (CEF) program with the BPU, a six-year estimated $3.6 billion investment covering four programs; (i) an Energy Efficiency (EE) program totaling $2.5 billion of investment designed to\nachieve energy efficiency targets required under New Jersey's Clean Energy law; (ii) an Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure program; (iii) an Energy Storage (ES) program and (iv) an Energy Cloud (EC) program which will include installing approximately two million electric smart meters and associated infrastructure. The review process for the CEF-EE program is expected to conclude by the third quarter of 2019. The CEF-EV/ ES and CEF-EC programs will have separate procedural schedules.\nIn November 2018, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (Rate Counsel) filed a motion to dismiss the CEF-EC filing on the basis that the BPU announced a moratorium on electric distribution companies' AMI program. In December 2018, Rate Counsel filed a motion to stay the CEF-EV/ES filing, arguing that the BPU should conclude other regulatory proceedings addressing EVs and ES, including the new Energy Master Plan and initiatives required by the Clean Energy Act, before it rules on PSE&G's program. We opposed Rate Counsel's motions, asking for the BPU to permit these filings to proceed. There is no timetable for the BPU to decide on Rate Counsel's motions.\nAlso, in October 2018, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of our distribution base rate proceeding with new rates effective November 1, 2018. The settlement resulted in a net reduction in overall annual revenues of approximately $13 million, comprised of a $212 million increase in base revenues, which includes the recovery of deferred storm costs, and the return of tax benefits largely due to tax reform of approximately $225 million. The Order provides for a distribution rate base of $9.5 billion, a 9.6% return on equity (ROE) for our distribution business and a 54% equity component of our capitalization structure.\nPower\nAt Power, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. Power continues to move its fleet toward improved efficiency and believes that its investment program enhances its competitive position with the addition of efficient, clean, reliable combined cycle gas turbine capacity. Our commitments for load, such as basic generation service (BGS) in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contracts, are backed by this generation or may be combined with the use of physical commodity purchases and financial instruments from the market to optimize the economic efficiency of serving our obligations. Power's hedging practices and ability to capitalize on market opportunities help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than half of Power's expected gross margin in 2018 relates to our hedging strategy, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.\nOur investments in Keys Energy Center (Keys), Sewaren 7 and Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 5 (BH5) reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the Power business. These additions to our fleet both expand our geographic diversity and adjust our fuel mix and enhance the environmental profile and overall efficiency of Power's generation fleet.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. Flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving market as we remain diligent in managing costs. In 2018, our\n \u2022 utility achieved continued strong reliability and customer satisfaction results, as well as comprehensive storm preparation and restoration efforts, and ongoing cost control, \n \u2022 diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 56 terawatt hours while addressing fuel availability and price volatility, and \n \u2022 total nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 91.4%.  Financial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2018 as we\n \u2022 maintained sufficient liquidity, \n \u2022 maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and \n \u2022 increased our indicative annual dividend for 2018 to $1.80 per share.  We expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) without the issuance of new equity. For additional information on the impacts of the Tax Act, see Item 8. Note 7. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Note 21. Income Taxes.\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and Power for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Millions, except per share data\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSE&G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PSEG Net Income Per Share (Diluted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2018 over 2017 decrease in Net Income was due primarily to the one-time favorable impacts in 2017 of new tax legislation at Power and Holdings, discussed below, and the recognition in 2018 of net unrealized losses on NDT Fund equity securities at Power in accordance with new accounting guidance. The decrease was partially offset by charges in 2017 related to the early retirement of our Hudson and Mercer units, as well as a lower federal tax rate at Power and higher earnings from T&D investments and the favorable impact of new rates upon settlement of the distribution base rate proceeding, discussed above, at PSE&G. For a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see Results of Operations.\nDisciplined Investment\nWe utilize rigorous criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. These areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. In 2018, we\n \u2022 made additional investments in T&D infrastructure projects, \n \u2022 continued to execute our GSMP I, Energy Efficiency and other existing BPU-approved utility programs, \n \u2022 received approval for our GSMP II program and filed our proposed ES II and CEF programs, and \n \u2022 commenced commercial operation of Sewaren 7 and Keys generation facilities and continued construction of our BH5 generation project, which is targeted for commercial operation in mid-2019.  Regulatory, Legislative and Other Developments\nIn our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. Transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. For additional information about regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect the company, see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues.\nTransmission Planning\nThere are several matters pending before FERC that may impact the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects, including those being constructed by PSE&G. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE&G's ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by customers in New Jersey. In addition, as a BGS supplier, Power provides services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these BGS-related transmission costs, BGS suppliers would be entitled to recovery, subject to BPU approval. We do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on Power's business or results of operations.\nSeveral complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners' base ROE. Certain of those complaints have resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners' base ROEs. The results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G.\nIn October 2018, FERC issued an order establishing a new framework for determining whether a company's ROE is unjust and unreasonable. FERC proposes to rely on financial models to establish a composite zone of reasonableness that will be used to determine whether an ROE complaint should be dismissed. If FERC determines that an ROE for a company is not just and reasonable, it intends to reset the ROE based on averaging the results of various financial models. We are still analyzing the potential impact of these methodologies and cannot predict the outcome of ongoing ROE proceedings.\nWholesale Power Market Design\nIn June 2018, FERC issued an order finding that PJM's current capacity market is not just and reasonable because it enabled state-supported resources to bid below their costs which resulted in suppressed clearing prices. In particular, FERC found that nuclear generating units that receive zero emission certificate (ZEC) payments were of concern. Depending on the outcome of this matter, our generating stations could also be impacted. For additional information see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues-Federal Regulation.\nIn February 2019, the PJM Board approved a filing to modify the curves used for pricing reserves with FERC. The reforms include a 30-minute reserve product in real-time, more dynamic reserve requirements to better capture operator actions taken to maintain reliability, and improvement to the curves used to price reserves during reserve shortage conditions. If placed into effect, this reform is expected to improve energy and reserve prices by ensuring that when operators commit resources to ensure reliability, the commitments are reflected in market clearing prices. However, this reform could result in lower capacity payments. There is no timeline for this type of filing and therefore we cannot predict when FERC will act on the filing or the outcome of this matter.\nIn October 2018, PJM filed with FERC to revise the shape of the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve that will be implemented for the capacity auction to be held in August 2019. The VRR curve is the administratively determined demand curve that serves as one of the key elements for establishing the amount of generation capacity to be procured in the auction. PJM contends that its proposal will lower capacity prices as compared to the currently effective VRR curve. PSEG protested PJM's proposal on the grounds that it would result in understated prices for capacity relative to the cost of constructing a new reference generating unit and will result in prices that are unjust and unreasonable. This matter is pending before FERC and we cannot predict the outcome.\nDistribution\nEffective in January 2018, the BPU adopted Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) regulations that encourage utilities to construct, install, or remediate utility plant and facilities related to reliability, resiliency, and/or safety to support the provision of safe and adequate service. Under these regulations, utilities can seek authority to make specified infrastructure investments in programs extending for up to five years with accelerated cost recovery mechanisms. The BPU characterized the IIP regulations as a regulatory initiative intended to create a financial incentive for utilities to accelerate the level of investment needed to promote the timely rehabilitation and replacement of certain traditional utility infrastructure that enhances reliability, resiliency, and/or safety. Since these regulations were adopted, the BPU approved our GSMP II and we filed our ES II and CEF-EC programs with the BPU.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the EPA and state environmental regulators. In particular, section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Implementation of Section 316(b) and related state regulations could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs.\nIn August 2018, the EPA released the proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as a replacement for the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The proposed ACE rule gives states great flexibility to evaluate specific heat rate improvement technologies and practices to be applied at coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years from the date of finalization to submit a plan that establishes a standard of performance that reflects the degree of emission limitation through the application of heat rate improvement technologies and practices. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nWe are also subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material.\nIn December 2018, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection proposed two rules that begin the state's re-entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The first proposal is the mechanism rulemaking that establishes the state's initial cap on greenhouse gas emissions of 18 million tons in 2020. The proposal follows the RGGI model rule with a cap that will decline three percent annually through 2030 to a final cap of 11.5 million tons. New Jersey is committed to a start date of January 1, 2020. The second proposal establishes the framework for how the state will spend the RGGI auction proceeds. We cannot estimate the impact of this action on our business or results of operations at this time.\nFor further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\nEarly Plant Retirements\nNuclear\nIn May 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed legislation, referred to as the ZEC legislation, that recognizes that nuclear power is a critical component of New Jersey's clean energy portfolio and an important element of a diverse energy generation portfolio that currently meets approximately 40 percent of New Jersey's electric power needs. The ZEC legislation creates a Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) program to be administered by the BPU. The BPU subsequently established processes to evaluate applications by qualified nuclear plants and to review and approve changes to the New Jersey's electric distribution companies' tariffs to provide for the purchase of ZECs from selected nuclear plants and recover those ZEC payments through a non-bypassable distribution charge (ZEC charge) in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per megawatt hour (MWh) in payments to selected nuclear plants. ZECs will be awarded to selected nuclear plants, if any, in April 2019 at which time ZEC revenue would commence and would continue for approximately three years. Nuclear plants receiving ZEC payments will be obligated to maintain operations, subject to exceptions specified in the ZEC legislation. The ZEC legislation requires nuclear plants to reapply for any subsequent three year periods. The ZEC payment may be adjusted by the BPU (a) at any time to offset environmental or fuel diversity payments that a selected nuclear plant may receive from another source or (b) at certain times specified in the ZEC legislation if the BPU determines that the purposes of the ZEC legislation can be achieved through a reduced charge that will nonetheless be sufficient to achieve the state's air quality and other environmental objectives by preventing the retirement of nuclear plants.\nIn December 2018, Power submitted applications to the BPU for the Salem 1 and 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants. These were the only applications received by the BPU. As required, Power's three applications each included a certification pursuant to which Power confirmed that each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants will cease operations within three years absent a material financial change. Power's submittal further attested that the nuclear plants are not expected to cover their costs and operating and market risks as defined in the ZEC legislation, absent a material financial change. As a result, absent a material financial change, Power will retire all three plants unless all of the plants receive ZECs. Power operates its nuclear plants as an interdependent fleet on a common site with shared costs and services, which allows them to achieve economies of scale. A decision to retire one nuclear plant would also adversely impact Power's ability to attract and retain qualified employees at its remaining plants. Power believes that the retirement of any individual nuclear plant would have the effect of decreasing the scale of its nuclear operations; however, the complex nature of operating nuclear plants would not decrease the attention required from management for the safe operation of the remaining nuclear operations. As a result, Power's decision to retire any nuclear plant would be made at the site level and would result in the retirement of all of these New Jersey nuclear plants.\nGiven the anticipated timing of the BPU's decision on which nuclear plants, if any, have been selected to receive ZECs, which is expected in April 2019, in March 2019 Power will submit to the PJM Independent Market Monitor and the PJM Office of Interconnection a request for a preliminary exception to PJM's Reliability Pricing Model must-offer requirement with respect to Power's interest for each of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants in connection with the 2022/2023 capacity auction expected to be held in August 2019. Power will also submit a deactivation notice to the extent that its filing deadline occurs prior to the award of ZECs by the BPU. If all of the Salem and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZECs, the preliminary exception and requested deactivation notice, as applicable, would be withdrawn.\nIn the event that any of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants is not selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 by the BPU and do not otherwise experience a material financial change, Power will take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants at or prior to their refueling outages scheduled for the Fall 2019 in the case of Hope Creek, Spring 2020 in the case of Salem 2 and Fall 2020 in the case of Salem 1. Alternatively, if all of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants are selected to receive ZEC payments in April 2019 but the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by potential changes to the capacity market construct being considered by FERC (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the BPU in accordance with a FERC authorized capacity mechanism), Power would still take all necessary steps to retire all of these plants. The costs and accounting charges associated with any such retirement, which may include, among other things, accelerated depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, potential penalties associated with the early termination of capacity obligations and fuel contracts, accelerated asset retirement costs, severance costs, environmental remediation costs and, in certain circumstances, potential additional funding of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund, would be material to both PSEG and Power.\nFollowing any action to retire its nuclear plants, Power would take the necessary steps to satisfy its capacity obligations through 2022 with other assets in its fleet or through market purchases. Power intends to decommission any retired nuclear plant using the SAFESTOR\u201d process, which is a process approved by the NRC. As a result, Power believes adequate funds are available in the NDT Fund for the early retirement of the nuclear plants. To the extent another decommissioning process is employed, the NDT Fund would not be sufficient to cover the costs of decommissioning all the nuclear plants upon early retirement.\nFossil\nIn December 2018, Power completed the sale of the sites of the retired Hudson and Mercer units. Power transferred all land rights and structures on the sites to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for the sites. As a result of the sale and transfer of liabilities, Power recorded a pre-tax gain in 2018 of $54 million in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Expense.\nIn addition, PSEG and Power continue to monitor their other coal assets, including their interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations, to assess their economic viability through the end of their designated useful lives and their continued classification as held for use. The precise timing of a change in useful lives may be dependent upon events out of PSEG's and Power's control and may impact their ability to operate or maintain certain assets in the future. These generating stations may be impacted by factors such as environmental legislation, co-owner capital requirements and continued depressed wholesale power prices or capacity factors, among other things. Any early retirement or change in the classification as held for use of our remaining coal units may have a material adverse impact on PSEG's and Power's future financial results.\nCalifornia Solar Facilities\nAs part of its solar production portfolio, Power owns and operates two California-based solar facilities with an aggregate capacity of approximately 30 MW direct current whose output is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) under power purchase agreements (PPAs) with twenty year terms. The net book value of these solar facilities was approximately $57 million as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, PG&E and its parent company PG&E Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Power cannot predict the ultimate outcome that this bankruptcy proceeding will have on our ability to collect all of the future revenues from these facilities due under the PPAs; however, any adverse changes to the terms of Power's PPAs as a result of this bankruptcy proceeding could result in the future impairment of these assets in amounts up to their current net book value.\nOffshore Wind\nIn January 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed Executive Order No. 8 directing the BPU to begin the process of moving the state toward its 2030 goal of 3,500 MW of offshore wind energy generation. An initial solicitation was established for 1,100 MW of offshore wind, with bids due in December 2018. In connection with the bid submitted by Ocean Wind, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of \u00d8rsted US Offshore Wind, referred to as the Ocean Wind project, PSEG agreed to provide energy management services and the potential lease of land for use in project development. We also retained an option to acquire an equity interest in the project. We expect to make a decision regarding an equity investment in the Ocean Wind project in the second half of 2019.\nLeveraged Leases\nIn December 2018, NRG REMA, LLC (REMA) emerged from its in-court proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Upon emergence, PSEG received $31.5 million in cash in exchange for transferring the ownership interests in Keystone and Conemaugh to the debtholders of REMA and satisfaction of all other claims asserted against REMA, as well as certain amendments to the Shawville lease. The Shawville lease amendments, among other things, will allow REMA to express interest in a renewal on or after November 24, 2019. In addition, REMA has agreed to fund qualifying credit support up to $36 million. As a result of the restructuring, Energy Holdings recognized a pre-tax gain in Operating Revenues of approximately $12 million ($9 million after tax). In addition, the remaining deferred tax liabilities related to these lease investments were reclassified to current tax liabilities. PSEG expects to pay approximately $120 million to taxing authorities resulting from this restructuring activity.\nAdditional facilities in our leveraged lease portfolio include the Joliet and Powerton generating facilities. Converted natural gas units such as Shawville and Joliet may have higher operating costs and fuel consumption, as well as longer start-up times, compared to newer combined cycle gas units. Powerton is a coal-fired generating facility in Illinois. Each of these three facilities may not be as economically competitive as newer combined cycle gas units and could continue to be adversely impacted by the same economic conditions experienced by other less efficient natural gas and coal generation facilities, which could require Energy Holdings to write down the residual value of the leveraged lease receivables associated with these facilities.\nTax Legislation\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act, among other things, decreased the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and made certain changes to bonus depreciation and interest disallowance rules.\nAs a result"}
