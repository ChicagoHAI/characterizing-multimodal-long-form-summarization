We are a leading provider of mission-critical, sophisticated software products and software-enabled services that allow financial services providers to automate complex business processes and effectively manage their information processing requirements. Our portfolio of software products and rapidly deployable software-enabled services allows our clients to automate and integrate front-office functions such as trading and modeling, middle-office functions such as portfolio management and reporting, and back-office functions such as accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing. Our solutions enable our clients to focus on core operations, better monitor and manage investment performance and risk, improve operating efficiency and reduce operating costs. We provide our solutions globally to more than 11,000 clients, principally within the institutional asset and wealth management, alternative investment management, financial advisory and financial institutions vertical markets. In addition, our clients include commercial lenders, real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d), corporate treasury groups, insurance and pension funds, municipal finance groups and real estate property managers.\nAcquisitions. To supplement our growth, we evaluate and execute acquisitions that provide complementary products or services, add proven technology and an established client base and expand our intellectual property portfolio or address a highly specialized problem or a market niche. Since the beginning of 2014, we have spent approximately $3.3 billion to acquire eight businesses in the financial services software industry, using a combination of cash on hand and debt financing (as discussed in Notes 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe following table lists the significant businesses we have acquired since January 1, 2014:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Acquired Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquired Capabilities, Products and Services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Conifer Financial Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and other asset management sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wells Fargo's Global Funds Services Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and private equity sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citigroup's Alternative Investor Services Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and private equity sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Primatics Financial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added cloud-based integrated risk, compliance and finance solution for the banking industry\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varden Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added cloud-based client and advisor communication solutions for investment firms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advent Software, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded global investment management software and services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DST Global Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added investment management software and services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discussion in this Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the operations of the business listed in the table above for the respective time periods each was owned by SS&C.\nRevenues. Our contractually recurring revenues, which include our maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues, were $1,371.5 million in 2016, compared to $916.6 million and $708.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, contractually recurring revenues represented 93% of total revenues, compared to 92% in both 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe our high level of contractually recurring revenues provides us with the ability to better manage our costs and capital investments. Our revenues from sales outside the United States were $400.2 million in 2016, compared to $318.0 million and $253.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs we have expanded our business, we have focused on increasing our contractually recurring revenues. Since 2014, we have seen increased demand in the financial services industry for our software-enabled services from existing and new customers. We have taken a number of steps to support that demand, such as automating our software-enabled services delivery methods, expanded our service offerings and providing our employees with sales incentives. We have also acquired businesses that offer software-enabled services or have a large base of term license or maintenance clients. Our software-enabled services revenues increased from $592.5 million in 2014 to $956.8 million in 2016. Our maintenance and term licenses revenues increased from $115.6 million in 2014 to $414.7 million in 2016. Maintenance customer retention rates have continued to be in excess of 90% for our core enterprise products, and we have maintained both pricing levels for new contracts and annual price increases for existing contracts. To support the growth in our software-enabled services revenues and maintain our level of customer service, we have added personnel, expanded our facilities and invested in information technology. These investments and automation improvements in our software-enabled services have served to improve gross margins.\nLiquidity. In connection with the acquisition of Advent in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, and issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023, or Senior Notes, each of which is described in Contractual Obligations, to fund a portion of the purchase price, refinance amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility ( Prior Facility\u201d) and raise cash for the acquisition of Citigroup's Alternative Investor Services business ( Citigroup AIS\u201d).\nWe generated $418.4 million in cash from operating activities in 2016, compared to $230.6 million and $252.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, we used our operating cash flow, $120.0 million in proceeds received from debt financing, $39.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and existing cash to acquire Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer, repay $383.4 million of debt, pay $50.1 million in dividends and invest in capital expenditures in our business.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenue from two sources: recurring revenues and, to a lesser degree, non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues consist of software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses. As a general matter, fluctuations in our software-enabled services revenues are attributable to the number of new software-enabled services clients as well as total assets under management in our clients' portfolios and the number of outsourced transactions provided to our existing clients. Maintenance revenues vary based on customer retention, the number of perpetual licenses and on the annual increases in fees, which are generally tied to the consumer price index, while term license revenues vary based on the rate by which we add or lose clients over time. Non-recurring revenues consist of professional services and perpetual license fees and tend to fluctuate based on the number of new licensing clients and demand for consulting services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following sources of revenues for the periods indicated:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

</tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 versus Fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of GFS and Conifer in the fourth quarter of 2016, Citigroup AIS in the first quarter of 2016, Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed $418.9 million in revenues. Additionally, organic revenues increased $71.4 million, of which approximately $13.6 million was the result of the impact of the fair value adjustment for acquired deferred revenue on the periods. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $9.2 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound and the Canadian dollar.\nMaintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $124.6 million and $263.6 million, respectively, in 2016. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues reflect reductions of $29.1 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services revenues related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $29.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in 2016. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $13.5 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015, Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015 and DSTGS in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services from alternative investment managers. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $13.9 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $131.7 million and $59.9 million, respectively, in 2015. These amounts reflect reductions of $49.8 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $20.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in 2015. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $6.4 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of recurring revenues consists primarily of costs related to personnel utilized in servicing our software-enabled services and maintenance contracts and amortization of intangible assets. Cost of non-recurring revenues consists primarily of the cost related to personnel utilized to provide implementation, conversion and training services to our software licensees, as well as system integration and custom programming consulting services and amortization of intangible assets.\nThe following tables set forth each of the following cost of revenues as a percentage of their respective

Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of GFS, Conifer, Citigroup AIS, Primatics, Varden and Advent, which added costs of $251.8 million. Additionally, total cost of revenues increased $24.3 million to support revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $8.0 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Varden, Advent and DSTGS, which added costs of $113.2 million. Included in those costs are charges of $2.9 million in 2015 related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $10.8 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs associated with the selling and marketing of our products, including salaries, commissions and travel and entertainment. Such expenses also include amortization of intangible assets, the cost of branch sales offices, trade shows and marketing and promotional materials. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs attributable to the enhancement of existing products and the development of new software products. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to management, accounting and finance, information management, human resources and administration and associated overhead costs, as well as fees for professional services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses (dollars in thousands) and percent change in operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\nfrom Prior\nPeriod\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 392,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 versus 2015. The increase in total operating expenses in 2016 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Conifer, GFS, Citigroup AIS, Varden and Advent, which added expenses of $109.7 million. Included in those costs are charges of $8.6 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional fees of $15.5 million primarily due to the acquisition of Advent in the prior year. These increases were also partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.7 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus 2014. The increase in total operating expenses in 2015 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Advent, Varden and DSTGS, which added expenses of $127.2 million in the period. Included in those costs are charges of $19.8 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $25.2 million. (See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of stock-based compensation.) Included in general and administrative expenses in 2015 are professional fees of $13.5 million associated with our acquisition of Advent. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.3 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nComparison of Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 for Interest, Taxes and Other\nInterest income. We had interest income of $1.5 million in 2016 compared to $2.0 million in 2015 and $1.7 million in 2014. The decrease in interest income in 2016 resulted from lower average cash balances during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in interest income in 2015 and 2014 resulted from higher average cash balances during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nInterest expense. We had interest expense of $129.9 million in 2016 compared to $79.3 million in 2015 and $27.2 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2016 reflects the full year effect of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense in 2015 reflects incremental borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a higher debt balance.\nOther income, net. Other income, net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction gains.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a $30.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 in connection with the repayment and termination of our Prior Facility. The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of a portion of the unamortized capitalized financing costs and the unamortized original issue discounts related to the Prior Facility for amounts accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as a portion of the financing costs related to the Credit Agreement for amounts accounted for as a debt modification.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The following table sets forth the provision for income taxes (dollars in thousands) and effective tax rates for the periods indicated:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\nfrom Prior\nPeriod\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2016, 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of our foreign operations. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the absence of the unfavorable impact of nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the beneficial impact of an enacted rate change in the U.K. and a reduction in domestic income before taxes. We had $513.5 million and $580.5 million of deferred tax liabilities and $62.4 and $73.1 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of operations outside the U.S., which historically have been taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. While we have income from multiple foreign sources, the majority of our non-U.S. operations are in Canada, India and the U.K., where the statutory rates were 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.0%, respectively, in 2016, 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.3%, respectively, in 2015, and 26.5%, 34.0% and 21.5%, respectively, in 2014. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development and to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and cash available under the Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2016, we purchased Citigroup AIS for approximately $296.1 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2016, we purchased GFS for approximately $73.2 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities, as well as Conifer for approximately $86.7 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. We funded these purchases with cash on hand and $120.0 million in additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nIn 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of common stock on March 15, 2016, June 15, 2016, September 15, 2016 and December 15, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016, June 1, 2016, September 1, 2016 and December 1, 2016, respectively, totaling $50.1 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 were $117.6 million, a decrease of $316.6 million from $434.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash is primarily due to cash used for acquisitions, repayments of debt, payment of dividends and capital expenditures. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds received from our borrowings as well as cash provided by operations, proceeds from stock option exercises and the related income tax benefits. See Notes 4, 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of equity, debt and acquisitions, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $418.4 million in 2016. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $131.0 million adjusted for non-cash items of $199.5 million and changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $87.9 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by a change in income taxes prepaid and payable and increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to the increase in deferred term license revenue related to Advent. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the increase in accrued employee compensation associated with the annual employee bonuses typically paid in the first quarter. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in days' sales outstanding related to receivables within recently acquired businesses.\nInvesting activities used net cash of $495.3 million in 2016, primarily related to cash paid of $457.5 million for the acquisitions of Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer in the first and fourth quarters of 2016, $27.9 million in capital expenditures and $9.6 million in capitalized software.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $236.1 million in 2016, representing repayments of debt totaling $383.4 million, $50.1 million in quarterly dividends, $7.4 million in withholding taxes related to equity award net share settlements and the payment of $0.5 million in fees related to refinancing activities. These payments were partially offset by $120.0 million received from debt borrowings, $39.2 million from stock option exercises and related income tax windfall benefits of $46.2 million.\nWe have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $76.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at non-U.S. subsidiaries where we had made such a determination and in turn no provision for U.S. income taxes had been made. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $64.9 million in cash that was available to our foreign borrowers under our credit facility and will be used to facilitate debt servicing of those entities. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $19.9 million in cash at our Indian operations that if repatriated to our foreign debt holder would incur distribution taxes of approximately $3.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 that require us to make future cash payments (in thousands):\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations and\nOther Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less\nthan\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> All\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term and long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,559,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,148,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 383,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax positions and related interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,632,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 469,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,447,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Reflects interest payments on our Credit Agreement at an assumed interest rate of one-month LIBOR of 0.77% plus 2.75% for U.S. dollar loans on our Term A-1 and A-2 facilities, one-month LIBOR of 0.77% plus 3.25% on our Term B-1 and B-2 facilities, one-month LIBOR of 0.77% plus 2.75% on the revolving credit facility and 5.875% on our Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We are obligated under noncancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment.

The Credit Agreement has four tranches of term loans, or together the Term Loans: (i) a $98 million term A-1 facility with a five year term for borrowings by SS&C Sarl, or Term A-1 Loan; (ii) a $152 million term A-2 facility with a five year term for borrowings by SS&C Tech Sarl, or Term A-2 Loan; (iii) a $1.82 billion term B-1 facility with a seven year term for borrowings by SS&C, or Term B-1 Loan; and (iv) a $410 million term B-2 facility with a seven year term for borrowings by SS&C Sarl, or Term B-2 Loan.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement has a revolving credit facility with a five year term available for borrowings by SS&C with $150 million in available commitments, or the Revolving Credit Facility, of which $94.0 million was drawn as of December 31, 2016. No amount was drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a $25 million letter of credit sub-facility, of which $0.6 million was drawn as of December 31, 2016. No amount was drawn on the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the election of the borrowers, at the base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, plus the applicable interest rate margin for the credit facility. The Term A-1 Loan, Term A-2 Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 2.75% or at the base rate plus 1.75%, and are subject to a step-down at any time SS&C's consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is less than 3.0 times, to 2.50% in the case of the LIBOR margin and 1.50% in the case of the base rate margin. The Term B-1 Loan and Term B-2 Loan initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 3.25%, with LIBOR subject to a 0.75% floor, or at the base rate plus 2.25%, and are subject to a step-down at any time SS&C's consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 4.0 times, to 3.00% in the case of the LIBOR margin and 2.00% in the case of the base rate margin.\nA portion of the initial proceeds from the Term Loans was used to satisfy the consideration required to fund the acquisition of Advent and to repay all amounts outstanding under our then-existing credit facility, or Prior Facility, which was subsequently terminated. At the time of the termination of the Prior Facility, all liens and other security interests that SS&C had granted to the lenders under the Prior Facility were released. The refinancing of the Prior Facility was evaluated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification 470-50, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments, for modification and extinguishment accounting. We accounted for the refinancing as a debt modification with respect to amounts that remained obligations of the same lender in the syndicate with minor changes in cash flows and as a debt extinguishment with respect to amounts that were obligations of lenders that exited the syndicate or remained in the syndicate but experienced a change in cash flows of greater than 10%. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there was $91.9 million in principal amount outstanding under the term A-1 facility, $142.5 million in principal amount outstanding under the term A-2 facility, $1,480.2 million in principal amount outstanding under the term B-1 facility, $151.1 million in principal amount outstanding under the term B-2 facility and $94.0 million in principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe are required to make scheduled quarterly payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term B-1 Loan and Term B-2 Loan, with the balance due and payable on the seventh anniversary of its incurrence. We are required to make scheduled quarterly payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term A-1 Loan and Term A-2 Loan until September 30, 2017 and quarterly payments of 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term A-1 Loan and Term A-2 Loan from December 31, 2017 until June 30, 2020 with the balance due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the incurrence thereof. No amortization is required under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur obligations under the Term Loans are guaranteed by (i) Holdings and each of our existing and future U.S. wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, in the case of the Term B-1 Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) Holdings, SS&C and each of our existing and future wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, in the case of the Term A-1 Loan, the Term A-2 Loan and the Term B-2 Loan.\nThe obligations of the U.S. loan parties under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of such persons (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations) and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign restricted subsidiaries of such persons (with customary exceptions and limitations). All obligations of the non-U.S. loan parties under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of Holdings' and the other guarantors' assets (subject to customary exceptions and limitations), including a pledge of all of the capital stock of substantially all of Holdings' wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries (with customary exceptions and limitations).\nThe Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur debt or liens, make investments (including in the form of loans and acquisitions), merge, liquidate or dissolve, sell property and assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries, pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock, alter the business we conduct, amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, or engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, certain defaults under agreements governing other material indebtedness could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, in which case the lenders could elect to accelerate payments under the Credit Agreement and terminate any commitments they have to provide future borrowings. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants.\nSenior Notes\nOn July 8, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Advent, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by SS&C and each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that borrows or guarantees obligations under the Credit Agreement. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations that are equal in right of payments to all existing and future senior debt, including the Credit Agreement.\nOn April 20, 2016, the Company commenced an offer to exchange for the Senior Notes, new notes identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes, except that the new notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The exchange offer expired on May 18, 2016 and 100% of the Senior Notes were exchanged for the new notes.\nAt any time after July 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. At any time on or before July 15, 2018, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.875% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes contains a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur debt or liens, make certain investments, pay dividends, dispose of certain assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or engage in transactions with our affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were $600.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.\nCovenant Compliance\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio. Our continued ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet this ratio. Any breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nConsolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used in key financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, which is a material facility supporting our capital structure and providing liquidity to our business. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Credit Agreement. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Consolidated EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information\nto investors to demonstrate compliance with the specified financial ratio and other financial condition tests contained in the Credit Agreement.\nManagement uses Consolidated EBITDA to gauge the costs of our capital structure on a day-to-day basis when full financial statements are unavailable. Management further believes that providing this information allows our investors greater transparency and a better understanding of our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make capital expenditures.\nAny breach of covenants in the Credit Agreement that are tied to ratios based on Consolidated EBITDA could result in an event of default under that agreement, in which case the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable and to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Any default and subsequent acceleration of payments under the Credit Agreement would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on Consolidated EBITDA.\nConsolidated EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, the Credit Agreement requires that Consolidated EBITDA be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter. Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.\nConsolidated EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and investors should not consider Consolidated EBITDA as a substitute for measures of our financial performance and liquidity as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income, operating income or net cash provided by operating activities. Because other companies may calculate Consolidated EBITDA differently than we do, Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Consolidated EBITDA has other limitations as an analytical tool, when compared to the use of net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, including:\nTable 126: <table>

In applying these policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, management's observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our clients and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets and other contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following are our critical accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues consist primarily of software-enabled services and maintenance and term license revenues, and, to a lesser degree, perpetual license and professional services revenues.\nSoftware-enabled services revenues, which are based on a monthly fee or are transaction-based, are recognized as the services are performed. Software-enabled services are generally provided under non-cancelable contracts with initial terms of one to five years that require monthly or quarterly payments, and are subject to automatic annual renewal at the end of the initial term unless terminated by either party.\nWe recognize software-enabled services revenues on a monthly basis as the software-enabled services are provided and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We do not recognize any revenues before services are performed. Certain contracts contain additional fees for increases in market value, pricing and trading activity. Revenues related to these additional fees are recognized in the month in which the activity occurs based upon our summarization of account information and trading volume.\nWe recognize revenues from the sale of perpetual licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Our products generally do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software and, accordingly, the implementation services we provide are not considered essential to the functionality of the software.\nWe use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement for the majority of our transactions. Delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier F.O.B. shipping point, or if delivered electronically, when the client has been provided with access codes that allow for immediate possession via a download. Although our arrangements generally do not have acceptance provisions, if such provisions are included in the arrangement, then delivery occurs at acceptance, unless such acceptance is deemed perfunctory. At the time of the transaction, we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms.\nCollection is assessed based on several factors, including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client. The arrangements for perpetual software licenses are generally sold with maintenance and professional services. We allocate revenue to the delivered components, normally the license component, using the residual value method based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the undelivered elements. The total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and customer support arrangement based on the fair value, which is derived from substantive renewal rates. Fair value of the professional services is based upon stand-alone sales of those services. Professional services are generally billed at an hourly rate plus out-of-pocket expenses. Professional services revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Maintenance agreements generally require us to provide technical support and software updates to our clients (on a when-and-if-available basis). We generally provide maintenance services under one-year renewable contracts. Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.\nThe Company also sells term licenses ranging from one to seven years, many of which include bundled maintenance services. For those arrangements with bundled maintenance services, VSOE does not exist for the maintenance element and therefore the total fee is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nWe occasionally enter into perpetual license agreements requiring significant customization or fixed-fee professional service arrangements. We account for these arrangements in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method based on the ratio of hours incurred to expected total hours; accordingly we must estimate the costs to complete the arrangement utilizing an estimate of man-hours remaining. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is at least reasonably possible that completion costs may be revised. Such revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Due to the complexity of some perpetual license agreements, we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions. Different judgments or different contract structures could have led to different accounting conclusions, which could have a material effect on our reported results of operations.\nLong-lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe must test goodwill annually for impairment (and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired). Historically, we have tested the recoverability of goodwill based on our reporting unit structure by comparing fair value to carrying value. To the extent that we do not achieve our revenue or operating cash flow plans or other measures of fair value decline, including external valuation assumptions, our current goodwill carrying value could be impaired. Additionally, since fair value is also based in part on the market approach, if our stock price declines, it is possible we could be required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test and impairment could result. The first step of the impairment analysis indicated that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value at December 31, 2016.\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment, we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets. We consider a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows. Differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge, if any, and thus materially different results of operations.\nAcquisition Accounting\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities we acquire, such as net tangible assets, completed technology, customer relationships, other identifiable intangible assets, deferred revenue and goodwill. We applied significant judgments and estimates in determining the fair market value of the assets acquired and their useful lives. For example, we have determined the fair value of existing client contracts based on the discounted estimated net future cash flows from such client contracts existing at the date of acquisition and the fair value of the completed technology based on the cost savings method or the relief-from-royalties method on estimated future revenues of such completed technology and assumed obsolescence factors. While actual results during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were consistent with our estimated cash flows and we did not incur any impairment charges during those years, different estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired assets could yield materially different results.\nStock-based Compensation\nUsing the fair value recognition provisions of relevant accounting literature, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards requires considerable judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock price, and the number of awards expected to be forfeited. In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. A deferred income tax asset is recorded over the vesting period as stock compensation expense is recorded for non-qualified stock options. The realizability of the deferred tax asset is ultimately based on the actual value of the stock-based award upon exercise. If the actual value is lower than the fair value determined on the date of grant, then there could be an income tax expense for the portion of the deferred tax asset that is not realizable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable and assess whether there is a need for additional valuation allowances. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recorded based on the statutory rates that we expect our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reverse into income. We estimate the state rate at which our deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse based on estimates of state income apportionment for future years. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment on the part of our management. In addition, we evaluate the need to provide additional tax provisions for adjustments proposed by taxing authorities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $39.2 million in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits. All of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate and increase our net income. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As a result of ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and then recognize an impairment charge, as necessary, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We expect to adopt ASU 2017-04 for our goodwill impairment tests in 2017.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Both ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 are effective for the Company for its first quarter of fiscal 2018. The impact of the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements will be to include the changes in restricted cash with the changes in cash and cash equivalents in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These ASU's are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Application of the ASU is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for its first quarter of fiscal 2017. The impact of the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-09 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements will be to recognize certain tax benefits or tax shortfalls upon a restricted-stock award vesting or stock option exercise event relative to the deferred tax asset position established in the provision for income taxes line of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) instead of to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is planning to apply this guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2017 and, accordingly, data for the prior years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 will not be adjusted. Excess tax benefits will be prospectively reported as an operating activity in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As the Company will be applying this guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2017, excess tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 will not be adjusted and continue to be reported in financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU would require lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date; (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under the amendments of this ASU. Additional disclosures will be required to allow the user to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing activities. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at the time of adoption. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for its first quarter of fiscal 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-02 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements will be to recognize the majority of the Company's operating lease commitments as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, which will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is continuing its assessment, which may identify additional impacts this ASU will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This ASU establishes specific guidance to an organization's management on their responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, deferring the effective date by one year for ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company for its first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.\nSubsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued the following updates: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net); ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in these updates affect the guidance contained within ASU 2014-09.\nThe new revenue standard is expected to change the revenue recognition practices for our perpetual and term software license arrangements. More specifically, we do not expect that the license component of our term license arrangements will be recognized ratably over the contractual term. We continue to evaluate the implications of the standard change. We intend to adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, provides an overview of the business, highlighting acquisitions, revenues, profitability, liquidity, and capital resources.

We are a leading provider of mission-critical, sophisticated software products and software-enabled services that allow financial services providers to automate complex business processes and effectively manage their information processing requirements. Our portfolio of software products and rapidly deployable software-enabled services allows our clients to automate and integrate front-office functions such as trading and modeling, middle-office functions such as portfolio management and reporting, and back-office functions such as accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing. Our solutions enable our clients to focus on core operations, better monitor and manage investment performance and risk, improve operating efficiency and reduce operating costs. We provide our solutions globally to more than 11,000 clients, principally within the institutional asset and wealth management, alternative investment management, financial advisory and financial institutions vertical markets. In addition, our clients include commercial lenders, real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d), corporate treasury groups, insurance and pension funds, municipal finance groups and real estate property managers.\nAcquisitions. To supplement our growth, we evaluate and execute acquisitions that provide complementary products or services, add proven technology and an established client base and expand our intellectual property portfolio or address a highly specialized problem or a market niche. Since the beginning of 2014, we have spent approximately $3.3 billion to acquire eight businesses in the financial services software industry, using a combination of cash on hand and debt financing (as discussed in Notes 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe following table lists the significant businesses we have acquired since January 1, 2014:\n\nThe discussion in this Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the operations of the business listed in the table above for the respective time periods each was owned by SS&C.\nRevenues. Our contractually recurring revenues, which include our maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues, were $1,371.5 million in 2016, compared to $916.6 million and $708.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, contractually recurring revenues represented 93% of total revenues, compared to 92% in both 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe our high level of contractually recurring revenues provides us with the ability to better manage our costs and capital investments. Our revenues from sales outside the United States were $400.2 million in 2016, compared to $318.0 million and $253.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs we have expanded our business, we have focused on increasing our contractually recurring revenues. Since 2014, we have seen increased demand in the financial services industry for our software-enabled services from existing and new customers. We have taken a number of steps to support that demand, such as automating our software-enabled services delivery methods, expanded our service offerings and providing our employees with sales incentives. We have also acquired businesses that offer software-enabled services or have a large base of term license or maintenance clients. Our software-enabled services revenues increased from $592.5 million in 2014 to $956.8 million in 2016. Our maintenance and term licenses revenues increased from $115.6 million in 2014 to $414.7 million in 2016. Maintenance customer retention rates have continued to be in excess of 90% for our core enterprise products, and we have maintained both pricing levels for new contracts and annual price increases for existing contracts. To support the growth in our software-enabled services revenues and maintain our level of customer service, we have added personnel, expanded our facilities and invested in information technology. These investments and automation improvements in our software-enabled services have served to improve gross margins.\nLiquidity. In connection with the acquisition of Advent in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, and issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023, or Senior Notes, each of which is described in Contractual Obligations, to fund a portion of the purchase price, refinance amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility ( Prior Facility\u201d) and raise cash for the acquisition of Citigroup's Alternative Investor Services business ( Citigroup AIS\u201d).\nWe generated $418.4 million in cash from operating activities in 2016, compared to $230.6 million and $252.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, we used our operating cash flow, $120.0 million in proceeds received from debt financing, $39.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and existing cash to acquire Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer, repay $383.4 million of debt, pay $50.1 million in dividends and invest in capital expenditures in our business.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenue from two sources: recurring revenues and, to a lesser degree, non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues consist of software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses. As a general matter, fluctuations in our software-enabled services revenues are attributable to the number of new software-enabled services clients as well as total assets under management in our clients' portfolios and the number of outsourced transactions provided to our existing clients. Maintenance revenues vary based on customer retention, the number of perpetual licenses and on the annual increases in fees, which are generally tied to the consumer price index, while term license revenues vary based on the rate by which we add or lose clients over time. Non-recurring revenues consist of professional services and perpetual license fees and tend to fluctuate based on the number of new licensing clients and demand for consulting services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following sources of revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth revenues (dollars in thousands) and percent change in revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal 2016 versus Fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of GFS and Conifer in the fourth quarter of 2016, Citigroup AIS in the first quarter of 2016, Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed $418.9 million in revenues. Additionally, organic revenues increased $71.4 million, of which approximately $13.6 million was the result of the impact of the fair value adjustment for acquired deferred revenue on the periods. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $9.2 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound and the Canadian dollar.\nMaintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $124.6 million and $263.6 million, respectively, in 2016. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues reflect reductions of $29.1 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services revenues related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $29.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in 2016. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $13.5 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015, Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015 and DSTGS in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services from alternative investment managers. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $13.9 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $131.7 million and $59.9 million, respectively, in 2015. These amounts reflect reductions of $49.8 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $20.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in 2015. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $6.4 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of recurring revenues consists primarily of costs related to personnel utilized in servicing our software-enabled services and maintenance contracts and amortization of intangible assets. Cost of non-recurring revenues consists primarily of the cost related to personnel utilized to provide implementation, conversion and training services to our software licensees, as well as system integration and custom programming consulting services and amortization of intangible assets.\nThe following tables set forth each of the following cost of revenues as a percentage of their respective revenue source for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth cost of revenues (dollars in thousands) and percent change in cost of revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal 2016 versus Fiscal 2015. Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of GFS, Conifer, Citigroup AIS, Primatics, Varden and Advent, which added costs of $251.8 million. Additionally, total cost of revenues increased $24.3 million to support revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $8.0 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Varden, Advent and DSTGS, which added costs of $113.2 million. Included in those costs are charges of $2.9 million in 2015 related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $10.8 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs associated with the selling and marketing of our products, including salaries, commissions and travel and entertainment. Such expenses also include amortization of intangible assets, the cost of branch sales offices, trade shows and marketing and promotional materials. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs attributable to the enhancement of existing products and the development of new software products. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to management, accounting and finance, information management, human resources and administration and associated overhead costs, as well as fees for professional services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following operating expenses for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses (dollars in thousands) and percent change in operating expenses for the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal 2016 versus 2015. The increase in total operating expenses in 2016 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Conifer, GFS, Citigroup AIS, Varden and Advent, which added expenses of $109.7 million. Included in those costs are charges of $8.6 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional fees of $15.5 million primarily due to the acquisition of Advent in the prior year. These increases were also partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.7 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus 2014. The increase in total operating expenses in 2015 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Advent, Varden and DSTGS, which added expenses of $127.2 million in the period. Included in those costs are charges of $19.8 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $25.2 million. (See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of stock-based compensation.) Included in general and administrative expenses in 2015 are professional fees of $13.5 million associated with our acquisition of Advent. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.3 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nComparison of Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 for Interest, Taxes and Other\nInterest income. We had interest income of $1.5 million in 2016 compared to $2.0 million in 2015 and $1.7 million in 2014. The decrease in interest income in 2016 resulted from lower average cash balances during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in interest income in 2015 and 2014 resulted from higher average cash balances during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nInterest expense. We had interest expense of $129.9 million in 2016 compared to $79.3 million in 2015 and $27.2 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2016 reflects the full year effect of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense in 2015 reflects incremental borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a higher debt balance.\nOther income, net. Other income, net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction gains.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a $30.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 in connection with the repayment and termination of our Prior Facility. The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of a portion of the unamortized capitalized financing costs and the unamortized original issue discounts related to the Prior Facility for amounts accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as a portion of the financing costs related to the Credit Agreement for amounts accounted for as a debt modification.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The following table sets forth the provision for income taxes (dollars in thousands) and effective tax rates for the periods indicated:\n\nOur 2016, 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of our foreign operations. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the absence of the unfavorable impact of nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the beneficial impact of an enacted rate change in the U.K. and a reduction in domestic income before taxes. We had $513.5 million and $580.5 million of deferred tax liabilities and $62.4 and $73.1 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of operations outside the U.S., which historically have been taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. While we have income from multiple foreign sources, the majority of our non-U.S. operations are in Canada, India and the U.K., where the statutory rates were 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.0%, respectively, in 2016, 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.3%, respectively, in 2015, and 26.5%, 34.0% and 21.5%, respectively, in 2014. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development and to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and cash available under the Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2016, we purchased Citigroup AIS for approximately $296.1 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2016, we purchased GFS for approximately $73.2 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities, as well as Conifer for approximately $86.7 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. We funded these purchases with cash on hand and $120.0 million in additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nIn 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of common stock on March 15, 2016, June 15, 2016, September 15, 2016 and December 15, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016, June 1, 2016, September 1, 2016 and December 1, 2016, respectively, totaling $50.1 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 were $117.6 million, a decrease of $316.6 million from $434.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash is primarily due to cash used for acquisitions, repayments of debt, payment of dividends and capital expenditures. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds received from our borrowings as well as cash provided by operations, proceeds from stock option exercises and the related income tax benefits. See Notes 4, 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of equity, debt and acquisitions, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $418.4 million in 2016. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $131.0 million adjusted for non-cash items of $199.5 million and changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $87.9 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by a change in income taxes prepaid and payable and increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to the increase in deferred term license revenue related to Advent. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the increase in accrued employee compensation associated with the annual employee bonuses typically paid in the first quarter. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in days' sales outstanding related to receivables within recently acquired businesses.\nInvesting activities used net cash of $495.3 million in 2016, primarily related to cash paid of $457.5 million for the acquisitions of Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer in the first and fourth quarters of 2016, $27.9 million in capital expenditures and $9.6 million in capitalized software.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $236.1 million in 2016, representing repayments of debt totaling $383.4 million, $50.1 million in quarterly dividends, $7.4 million in withholding taxes related to equity award net share settlements and the payment of $0.5 million in fees related to refinancing activities. These payments were partially offset by $120.0 million received from debt borrowings, $39.2 million from stock option exercises and related income tax windfall benefits of $46.2 million.\nWe have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $76.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at non-U.S. subsidiaries where we had made such a determination and in turn no provision for U.S. income taxes had been made. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $64.9 million in cash that was available to our foreign borrowers under our credit facility and will be used to facilitate debt servicing of those entities. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $19.9 million in cash at our Indian operations that if repatriated to our foreign debt holder would incur distribution taxes of approximately $3.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 that require us to make future cash payments (in thousands):\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations and\nOther Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less\nthan\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> All\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term and long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,559,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,148,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 383,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax positions and related interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nBusiness.

Our portfolio of software products and rapidly deployable software-enabled services allows our clients to automate and integrate front-office functions such as trading and modeling, middle-office functions such as portfolio management and reporting, and back-office functions such as accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing. Our solutions enable our clients to focus on core operations, better monitor and manage investment performance and risk, improve operating efficiency and reduce operating costs. We provide our solutions globally to more than 11,000 clients, principally within the institutional asset and wealth management, alternative investment management, financial advisory and financial institutions vertical markets. In addition, our clients include commercial lenders, real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d), corporate treasury groups, insurance and pension funds, municipal finance groups and real estate property managers.\nAcquisitions. To supplement our growth, we evaluate and execute acquisitions that provide complementary products or services, add proven technology and an established client base and expand our intellectual property portfolio or address a highly specialized problem or a market niche. Since the beginning of 2014, we have spent approximately $3.3 billion to acquire eight businesses in the financial services software industry, using a combination of cash on hand and debt financing (as discussed in Notes 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe following table lists the significant businesses we have acquired since January 1, 2014:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Acquired Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquired Capabilities, Products and Services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Conifer Financial Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and other asset management sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wells Fargo's Global Funds Services Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and private equity sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citigroup's Alternative Investor Services Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded fund administration services in hedge fund and private equity sectors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Primatics Financial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added cloud-based integrated risk, compliance and finance solution for the banking industry\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Varden Technologies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added cloud-based client and advisor communication solutions for investment firms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advent Software, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expanded global investment management software and services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DST Global Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Added investment management software and services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discussion in this Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the operations of the business listed in the table above for the respective time periods each was owned by SS&C.\nRevenues. Our contractually recurring revenues, which include our maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues, were $1,371.5 million in 2016, compared to $916.6 million and $708.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, contractually recurring revenues represented 93% of total revenues, compared to 92% in both 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe our high level of contractually recurring revenues provides us with the ability to better manage our costs and capital investments. Our revenues from sales outside the United States were $400.2 million in 2016, compared to $318.0 million and $253.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs we have expanded our business, we have focused on increasing our contractually recurring revenues. Since 2014, we have seen increased demand in the financial services industry for our software-enabled services from existing and new customers. We have taken a number of steps to support that demand, such as automating our software-enabled services delivery methods, expanded our service offerings and providing our employees with sales incentives. We have also acquired businesses that offer software-enabled services or have a large base of term license or maintenance clients. Our software-enabled services revenues increased from $592.5 million in 2014 to $956.8 million in 2016. Our maintenance and term licenses revenues increased from $115.6 million in 2014 to $414.7 million in 2016. Maintenance customer retention rates have continued to be in excess of 90% for our core enterprise products, and we have maintained both pricing levels for new contracts and annual price increases for existing contracts. To support the growth in our software-enabled services revenues and maintain our level of customer service, we have added personnel, expanded our facilities and invested in information technology. These investments and automation improvements in our software-enabled services have served to improve gross margins.\nLiquidity. In connection with the acquisition of Advent in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, and issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023, or Senior Notes, each of which is described in Contractual Obligations, to fund a portion of the purchase price, refinance amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility ( Prior Facility\u201d) and raise cash for the acquisition of Citigroup's Alternative Investor Services business ( Citigroup AIS\u201d).\nWe generated $418.4 million in cash from operating activities in 2016, compared to $230.6 million and $252.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, we used our operating cash flow, $120.0 million in proceeds received from debt financing, $39.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and existing cash to acquire Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer, repay $383.4 million of debt, pay $50.1 million in dividends and invest in capital expenditures in our business.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenue from two sources: recurring revenues and, to a lesser degree, non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues consist of software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses. As a general matter, fluctuations in our software-enabled services revenues are attributable to the number of new software-enabled services clients as well as total assets under management in our clients' portfolios and the number of outsourced transactions provided to our existing clients. Maintenance revenues vary based on customer retention, the number of perpetual licenses and on the annual increases in fees, which are generally tied to the consumer price index, while term license revenues vary based on the rate by which we add or lose clients over time. Non-recurring revenues consist of professional services and perpetual license fees and tend to fluctuate based on the number of new licensing clients and demand for consulting services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following sources of revenues for the periods indicated:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

</tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 versus Fiscal 2015. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of GFS and Conifer in the fourth quarter of 2016, Citigroup AIS in the first quarter of 2016, Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed $418.9 million in revenues. Additionally, organic revenues increased $71.4 million, of which approximately $13.6 million was the result of the impact of the fair value adjustment for acquired deferred revenue on the periods. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $9.2 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound and the Canadian dollar.\nMaintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $124.6 million and $263.6 million, respectively, in 2016. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues reflect reductions of $29.1 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services revenues related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $29.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in 2016. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $13.5 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our revenues increased primarily due to revenues related to our acquisitions of Primatics in the fourth quarter of 2015, Varden and Advent in the third quarter of 2015 and DSTGS in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as a continued increase in demand for our fund administration services from alternative investment managers. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $13.9 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound. Maintenance and term licenses revenues and software-enabled services revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $131.7 million and $59.9 million, respectively, in 2015. These amounts reflect reductions of $49.8 million in maintenance and term license revenues and software-enabled services related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue for these acquisitions. Professional services revenues and perpetual license revenues experienced increases due to the acquisitions, which contributed revenues of $20.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in 2015. Professional services revenues reflect a reduction of $6.4 million related to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue related to Advent.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of recurring revenues consists primarily of costs related to personnel utilized in servicing our software-enabled services and maintenance contracts and amortization of intangible assets. Cost of non-recurring revenues consists primarily of the cost related to personnel utilized to provide implementation, conversion and training services to our software licensees, as well as system

Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of GFS, Conifer, Citigroup AIS, Primatics, Varden and Advent, which added costs of $251.8 million. Additionally, total cost of revenues increased $24.3 million to support revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $8.0 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014. Our total cost of revenues increased primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Varden, Advent and DSTGS, which added costs of $113.2 million. Included in those costs are charges of $2.9 million in 2015 related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $10.8 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs associated with the selling and marketing of our products, including salaries, commissions and travel and entertainment. Such expenses also include amortization of intangible assets, the cost of branch sales offices, trade shows and marketing and promotional materials. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs attributable to the enhancement of existing products and the development of new software products. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to management, accounting and finance, information management, human resources and administration and associated overhead costs, as well as fees for professional services.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our total revenues represented by each of the following operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses (dollars in thousands) and percent change in operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\nfrom Prior\nPeriod\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 392,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2016 versus 2015. The increase in total operating expenses in 2016 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Conifer, GFS, Citigroup AIS, Varden and Advent, which added expenses of $109.7 million. Included in those costs are charges of $8.6 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional fees of $15.5 million primarily due to the acquisition of Advent in the prior year. These increases were also partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.7 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Indian Rupee.\nFiscal 2015 versus 2014. The increase in total operating expenses in 2015 was primarily due to our acquisitions of Primatics, Advent, Varden and DSTGS, which added expenses of $127.2 million in the period. Included in those costs are charges of $19.8 million related to the elimination of redundant positions within the acquired businesses and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $25.2 million. (See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of stock-based compensation.) Included in general and administrative expenses in 2015 are professional fees of $13.5 million associated with our acquisition of Advent. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $4.3 million, which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound.\nComparison of Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 for Interest, Taxes and Other\nInterest income. We had interest income of $1.5 million in 2016 compared to $2.0 million in 2015 and $1.7 million in 2014. The decrease in interest income in 2016 resulted from lower average cash balances during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in interest income in 2015 and 2014 resulted from higher average cash balances during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nInterest expense. We had interest expense of $129.9 million in 2016 compared to $79.3 million in 2015 and $27.2 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2016 reflects the full year effect of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense in 2015 reflects incremental borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes in connection with our acquisition of Advent during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a higher debt balance.\nOther income, net. Other income, net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction gains.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a $30.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 in connection with the repayment and termination of our Prior Facility. The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of a portion of the unamortized capitalized financing costs and the unamortized original issue discounts related to the Prior Facility for amounts accounted for as a debt extinguishment, as well as a portion of the financing costs related to the Credit Agreement for amounts accounted for as a debt modification.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The following table sets forth the provision for income taxes (dollars in thousands) and effective tax rates for the periods indicated:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\nfrom Prior\nPeriod\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2016, 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of our foreign operations. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the absence of the unfavorable impact of nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs and taxes incurred on a one time repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the beneficial impact of an enacted rate change in the U.K. and a reduction in domestic income before taxes. We had $513.5 million and $580.5 million of deferred tax liabilities and $62.4 and $73.1 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of operations outside the U.S., which historically have been taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. While we have income from multiple foreign sources, the majority of our non-U.S. operations are in Canada, India and the U.K., where the statutory rates were 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.0%, respectively, in 2016, 26.5%, 34.6% and 20.3%, respectively, in 2015, and 26.5%, 34.0% and 21.5%, respectively, in 2014. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal cash requirements are to finance the costs of our operations pending the billing and collection of client receivables, to fund payments with respect to our indebtedness, to invest in research and development and to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We expect our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and cash available under the Credit Agreement to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next twelve months.\nIn March 2016, we purchased Citigroup AIS for approximately $296.1 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2016, we purchased GFS for approximately $73.2 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities, as well as Conifer for approximately $86.7 million, plus the costs of effecting the transaction and the assumption of certain liabilities. We funded these purchases with cash on hand and $120.0 million in additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nIn 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of common stock on March 15, 2016, June 15, 2016, September 15, 2016 and December 15, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2016, June 1, 2016, September 1, 2016 and December 1, 2016, respectively, totaling $50.1 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 were $117.6 million, a decrease of $316.6 million from $434.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash is primarily due to cash used for acquisitions, repayments of debt, payment of dividends and capital expenditures. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds received from our borrowings as well as cash provided by operations, proceeds from stock option exercises and the related income tax benefits. See Notes 4, 6 and 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of equity, debt and acquisitions, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $418.4 million in 2016. Cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from net income of $131.0 million adjusted for non-cash items of $199.5 million and changes in our working capital accounts (excluding the effect of acquisitions) totaling $87.9 million. The changes in our working capital accounts were driven by a change in income taxes prepaid and payable and increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to the increase in deferred term license revenue related to Advent. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the increase in accrued employee compensation associated with the annual employee bonuses typically paid in the first quarter. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a decrease in days' sales outstanding related to receivables within recently acquired businesses.\nInvesting activities used net cash of $495.3 million in 2016, primarily related to cash paid of $457.5 million for the acquisitions of Citigroup AIS, GFS and Conifer in the first and fourth quarters of 2016, $27.9 million in capital expenditures and $9.6 million in capitalized software.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $236.1 million in 2016, representing repayments of debt totaling $383.4 million, $50.1 million in quarterly dividends, $7.4 million in withholding taxes related to equity award net share settlements and the payment of $0.5 million in fees related to refinancing activities. These payments were partially offset by $120.0 million received from debt borrowings, $39.2 million from stock option exercises and related income tax windfall benefits of $46.2 million.\nWe have made a permanent reinvestment determination in certain non-U.S. operations that have historically generated positive operating cash flows. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $76.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at non-U.S. subsidiaries where we had made such a determination and in turn no provision for U.S. income taxes had been made. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $64.9 million in cash that was available to our foreign borrowers under our credit facility and will be used to facilitate debt servicing of those entities. At December 31, 2016, we held approximately $19.9 million in cash at our Indian operations that if repatriated to our foreign debt holder would incur distribution taxes of approximately $3.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 that require us to make future cash payments (in thousands):\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations and\nOther Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less\nthan\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> All\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term and long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,559,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,148,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 202,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 383,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax positions and related interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>"}
