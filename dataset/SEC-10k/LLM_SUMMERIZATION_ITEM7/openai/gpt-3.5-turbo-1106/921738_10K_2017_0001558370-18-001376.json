MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company issued a press release summarizing its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. These results included an impairment charge of $48.5 million on the Company's loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC. In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May. As a result, the Company recorded an additional charge of $29.4 million on the loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Operations\nWe are a leading, geographically diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal operations. In 2015, we launched our interactive gaming strategy through our subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures which focuses on social gaming products.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-nine facilities in the following seventeen jurisdictions: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario, Canada.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue, derived primarily from gaming on slot machines (which represented approximately 87% of our gaming revenue in 2017 and 2016 and to a lesser extent, table games, which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties. Other revenues are derived from our management service fees from Casino Rama, our hotel, dining, retail, admissions, program sales, concessions and certain other ancillary activities, and our racing operations. Our racing revenue includes our share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and our share of wagering from our off-track wagering facilities.\nKey performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage. Our typical property slot hold percentage is in the range of 6% to 10% of slot handle, and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of 16% to 26% of table game drop.\nSlot handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. The win or hold percentage is the net amount of gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for accruals related to the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Our slot hold percentages have consistently been in the 6% to 10% range over the past several years. Given the stability in our slot hold percentages, we have not experienced significant impacts to earnings from changes in these percentages.\nFor table games, customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables. The cash and markers (extensions of credit granted to certain credit worthy customers) are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. Table game win is the amount of drop that is retained and recorded as casino gaming revenue, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for unredeemed gaming chips. As we are primarily focused on regional gaming markets, our table win percentages are fairly stable as the majority of these markets do not regularly experience high-end play, which can lead to volatility in win percentages. Therefore, changes in table game win percentages do not typically have a material impact to our earnings.\nOur properties generate significant operating cash flow, since most of our revenue is cash-based from slot machines, table games, and pari-mutuel wagering. Our business is capital intensive, and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to satisfy our obligations under the Master Lease, repay debt, fund maintenance capital expenditures, fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions.\nWe continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. Additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nSegment Information\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), as that term is defined in ASC 280, measures and assesses the Company's business performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations.\nThe Northeast reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Casino Toledo, Hollywood Casino Columbus, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, and Plainridge Park Casino, which opened on June 24, 2015. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service contract.\nThe South/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino, Hollywood Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, Boomtown Biloxi, M Resort, Tropicana Las Vegas, which was acquired on August 25, 2015, 1st Jackpot and Resorts which were acquired on May 1, 2017, as well as our management contract with Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego, which opened on October 10, 2016.\nThe Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, and Prairie State Gaming, which the Company acquired on September 1, 2015, and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC ( Kansas Entertainment\u201d), which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway.\nThe Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, which was sold on July 31, 2016, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes the Company's corporate overhead operations, which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280. Additionally, the Other category includes Penn Interactive Ventures, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary that represents its social online gaming initiatives, including Rocket Speed. Penn Interactive Ventures meets the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280, but is quantitatively not significant to the Company's operations as it represents less than 2% of net revenues and 5% of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its total assets represent less than 2% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel and believes it is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with the Company's share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for its joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our\nMaster Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction is accounted for as a financing obligation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to income from operations, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA.\nExecutive Summary\nAs reported by most jurisdictions, regional gaming industry trends have shown little revenue growth in recent years as numerous jurisdictions now permit gaming or have expanded their gaming offerings. The proliferation of new gaming facilities continues to impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as our operating results in certain markets. However, the current economic environment, specifically low unemployment levels, strengths in residential real estate prices, and higher levels of consumer confidence, has resulted in a stable operating environment in recent periods. Our ability to continue to succeed in this environment will be predicated on operating our existing facilities efficiently and offering our customers additional gaming experiences through our multi-channel distribution strategy. We will also seek to continue to expand our customer database through accretive acquisitions and capitalize on organic growth opportunities from our recent facility openings and new business lines.\nWe operate a geographically diversified portfolio comprised largely of new and well maintained regional gaming facilities. This has allowed us to develop what we believe to be a solid base for future growth opportunities supported by a flexible and attractively priced capital structure. We have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit and/or expand gaming in these jurisdictions and we are selected as a licensee.\nHistorically, the Company has been reliant on certain key regional gaming markets (for example, its results from Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). Over the past several years, we have diversified our operations via development of new facilities and acquisitions and we anticipate further reducing our reliance on specific properties subsequent to the closing of the Pinnacle transaction.\nOn December 18, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Pinnacle in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion inclusive of assumed indebtedness. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $20.00 in cash and 0.42 shares of Penn common stock for each Pinnacle share.\nCoincident with the closing, we plan to divest the membership interests of certain Pinnacle subsidiaries which operate the casinos known as Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (Missouri), Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (Missouri), Belterra Casino Resort (Indiana), and Belterra Park (Ohio) to Boyd Gaming Corp ( Boyd\u201d) for approximately $575 million in cash. These divestitures are anticipated to occur immediately prior to, and are conditioned upon, the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition. Additionally, at the closing of the merger, (i) GLPI will acquire the real estate associated with the Plainridge Park Casino for $250 million, and concurrently be leased back to Penn pursuant to the amended Pinnacle master lease for a fixed annual rent of $25 million and (ii) GLPI will acquire the real estate assets of Belterra Park from Penn for approximately $65 million, which subsequently will be included in an amended master lease between GLPI and Boyd. The amended Pinnacle Master Lease will be adjusted for incremental rent of $13.9 million to adjust to market conditions.\nWe will have significantly greater operational and geographic diversity and operate a combined 41 properties in 20 jurisdictions throughout North America. The transaction is expected to generate $100 million in annual run-rate cost synergies achieved within 24 months of closing. We also believe the transaction will present opportunities with respect to increased Las Vegas visitation and higher social gaming revenues from the enhanced scale and size of the customer database.\nPenn has received committed financing for the transaction, subject to customary conditions, from BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of the proceeds from the Boyd and GLPI transactions, existing cash on its balance sheet and new debt financing. Penn anticipates that the additional cash flow resulting from the acquisition will allow it to pay down debt on an accelerated basis after closing.\nThe transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is now subject to approval of the shareholders of Penn and Pinnacle, the approval of applicable gaming authorities, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2018.\nUpon completion of the transaction, former Penn and Pinnacle shareholders will hold 78 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of the combined company's outstanding shares.\nFinancial Highlights:\nWe reported net revenues and income from operations of $3,148.0 million and $445.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net revenues and income from operations of $3,034.4 million and $543.0 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in the prior year.

The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the accounting for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and loans to the JIVDC as critical accounting estimates, as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nWe believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.\nThe development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nLong-lived assets\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a net property and equipment balance of $2,756.7 million within our consolidated balance sheet, representing 52.7% of total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment,\u201d assets are grouped at the individual property level representing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions\nregarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $1,008.1 million in goodwill and $422.6 million in other intangible assets within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 19.3% and 8.1% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses. These assets require significant management estimates and judgment pertaining to: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and (ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.\nIn connection with the Company's acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of the Company's due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. An income approach, in which a discounted cash flow model is utilized and a market-based approach utilizing guideline public company ( GPC\u201d) multiples of adjusted EBTIDA from the Company's peer group is utilized to estimate the fair market value of the Company's reporting units.\nFor the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a GPC multiples approach which is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. The Company adjusts the carrying value of each reporting unit that utilizes property that is subject to the Master Lease by an allocation of a pro-rata portion of the GLPI financing obligation based on the reporting unit's estimated fair value as a percentage of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units that utilize property that is subject to the Master Lease.\nThe Company compares the aggregate weighted average fair value to the carrying value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the aggregate weighted average fair value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount of the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other,\u201d the Company considers its gaming licenses and certain other intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on the Company's future expectations to operate its gaming facilities indefinitely (notwithstanding our experience in 2014 in Iowa which the Company concluded was an isolated incident and the first time in the Company's history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause it to lose its gaming license) as well as its historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state commissions. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite life intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company completes its testing of its intangible assets prior to assessing the realizability of its goodwill.\nThe Company assessed the fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets (which are primarily gaming licenses) using the Greenfield Method under the income approach. The Greenfield Method estimates the fair value of the gaming license using a discounted cash flow model assuming the Company built a casino with similar utility to that of the existing facility. The method assumes a theoretical start up company going into business without any assets other than the intangible asset being valued. As such, the value of the gaming license is a function of the following items:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProjected revenues and operating cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing payments to its reporting units consistent with how the GLPI financing obligation is allocated);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTheoretical construction costs and duration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPre-opening expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDiscounting that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows attributable to the license.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing. The implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing obligation to its reporting units) that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent the Company's best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition. Changes in estimates, increases in the Company's cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, changes in operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates. If the Company's ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, the Company may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. The Company's estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where it conducts operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, or other events affecting the Company's properties.\nForecasted cash flows (based on the Company's annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter) can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which its reporting units operate. For example, increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and/or lower customer spend per visit. In addition, the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where the Company's reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for the Company to expand its operations. However, it also has the impact of increasing competition for the Company's established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations' profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations. Additionally, increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted cash flows.\nAssumptions and estimates about future cash flow levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective. They are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as industry, geopolitical and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in the Company's business strategy, which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance its overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit.\nConsistent with prior years, the Company's annual goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets impairment test is performed on October 1st of each year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $18.0 million, related to the goodwill at Tropicana Las Vegas and Sanford Orlando Kennel Club.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded other intangible assets impairment charges of $40.0 million, as of the valuation date of October 1, 2015, related to the write-off of our Plainridge Park Casino gaming license and a partial write-down of the gaming license at Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway due to a reduction in the long term earnings forecast at both of these locations.\nConsistent with prior years, we believe at this time all of our reporting units with goodwill and other intangible assets are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges. This is because the revenue and earning streams in our industry can vary significantly based on various circumstances, which in many cases are outside of the Company's control, and as such are extremely difficult to predict and quantify. We have disclosed several of these circumstances in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For instance, changes in legislation that approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions, further expansion of gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate, new state legislation that requires the implementation of smoking bans at our casinos or any other events outside of our control that make the customer experience less desirable.\nOnce an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Because the Company's goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized, there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. Intangible assets that have a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract. The Company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nThe Company's remaining goodwill and other intangible assets by reporting unit at December 31, 2017 is shown below (in thousands):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal Intangible\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReporting Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGoodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAssets\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino St. Louis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n205,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino Aurora\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n207,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nArgosy Casino Riverside\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n154,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nZia Park Casino\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n110,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPenn Interactive Ventures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrairie State Gaming\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino Lawrenceburg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino Tunica\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1st Jackpot Casino\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBoomtown Biloxi\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nArgosy Casino Alton\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlainridge Park Casino\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHollywood Casino at Charles Town Races\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOthers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,008,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n422,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance, if necessary. We consider all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. The evaluation of both positive and negative evidence is a requirement pursuant to ASC 740 in determining more likely than not the net deferred tax assets will be realized. In the event the Company determines that the deferred income tax assets would be realized in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn connection with the failed spin off leaseback, the Company recorded real property assets and a financing obligation of $2.00 billion and $3.52 billion, respectively, on November 1, 2013, which resulted in a substantial increase to our net deferred tax assets of $599.9 million. ASC 740 suggests that additional scrutiny should be given to deferred tax assets of an entity with cumulative pre tax losses during the most recent three years. Positive evidence of sufficient quantity and quality is required to overcome such significant negative evidence to conclude that a valuation allowance is not warranted. As of September 30, 2017, the Company determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against its federal net deferred tax assets for the portion that will be realized. As such, the Company released $741.9 million of its total valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the positive evidence outweighing the negative evidence thereby allowing the Company to achieve the more-likely-than-not\u201d realization standard. See Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nFederal Tax Reform - critical accounting changes\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly known as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which introduces significant changes to the United States tax law. The Tax Act provides numerous provisions including, but not limited to, a reduction to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, a temporary provision allowing 100% expensing of qualifying capital improvements (including those acquired via asset acquisitions) through 2022, which then phase out 20% a year thereafter, a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d).\nAlso, on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides accounting guidance for the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period similar to a business combination whereby recognizing provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information becomes available not to extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent the accounting related to the Tax Act is incomplete but a reasonable estimate is attainable, a provisional estimate should be reflected in the financial statements\nWe recorded a net charge of $266.0 million included in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consisting of three components: (i) a $261.3 million charge due to the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. based on the new lower federal income tax rate, (ii) a $2.6 million charge related to the one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred earnings from our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary (which we will pay interest free over 8 years) and (iii) a $2.1 million foreign withholding tax charge due to the new favorable U.S. treatment of foreign dividends whereby we have changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion. While we believe the $266.0 million net charge represents a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the Tax Act in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as of December 31, 2017, these amounts are considered provisional.\nThese adjustments reflected in our financial statements related to the application of the Tax Act are provisional amounts estimated based on published guidance and our interpretation as enacted. The new law directs the United States\nTreasury to promulgate regulations as it deems appropriate as well as provide guidance implementing the intent of Congress. We will recognize any change to the provisional amounts in the period any additional guidance is published.\nLoan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC\nFor year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for loan loss and reserves for unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC of $89.8 million within our consolidated statements of operations. Our loan is impaired and as such the value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the facility discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables\u201d. The estimate uses subjective assumptions such as, but not limited to, projected future earnings of the facility and potential proceeds which could be realized upon termination of our relationship with the Jamul Tribe. If our estimates are not accurate, we could incur additional losses up to our remaining maximum exposure on the loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC of approximately $28 million.\nResults of Operations\nThe following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMost of our properties operate in mature competitive markets. As a result, we expect a significant amount of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties (such as our pending acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, our August 2015 acquisition of Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino), jurisdictional expansions (such as our June 2015 opening of a slots-only gaming facility in Massachusetts, the September 2014 opening of Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course and the August 2014 opening of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway), expansions of gaming in existing jurisdictions (such as the introduction of table games in July 2010 at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and at Hollywood Casino Bangor in March 2012), expansions/improvements of existing properties (such as Tropicana Las Vegas) and new growth opportunities (such as our acquisition of Prairie State Gaming, a leading video lottery terminal operator in Illinois, and our entry into the interactive and social gaming space through Penn Interactive Ventures, including our recent acquisition of Rocket Speed).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming.

consumer spending. The proliferation of new gaming facilities has increased competition in many regional markets (including at some of our key facilities). As reported by most jurisdictions, regional gaming industry trends have shown limited revenue growth in recent years as numerous jurisdictions now permit gaming or have expanded their gaming offerings.\nWe have no certain mechanism for determining why consumers choose to spend more or less money at our properties from period to period and as such cannot quantify a dollar amount for each factor that impacts our customers' spending behaviors.\nHowever, based on our experience, we can generally offer some insight into the factors that we believe were likely to account for such changes. In instances where we believe one factor may have had a significantly greater impact than the other factors, we have noted that as well. However, in all instances, such insights are based only on our reasonable judgment and professional experience, and no assurance can be given as to the accuracy of our judgments.\nThe retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances.\u201d Our promotional allowance levels are determined based on various factors such as our marketing plans, competitive factors, economic conditions, and regulations.\nGaming revenue\n2017 Compared with 20166\nGaming revenue increased by $85.8 million, or 3.3%, to $2,692.0 million in 2017, primarily due to the variances explained below.\nGaming revenue for our Northeast segment increased by $14.1 million in 2017, primarily due to increased gaming revenue at all four of our Ohio properties, which together increased gaming revenues $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased gaming revenues at Plainridge Park Casino, partially offset by decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino Bangor and Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races due to increased competition from the Maryland market.\nGaming revenue for our Midwest segment increased by $27.2 million in 2017, primarily due to increased gaming revenue at Prairie State Gaming primarily resulting from the acquisition of the assets of four smaller VGT route operators in Illinois since the fourth quarter 2016 and increased gaming revenue at Argosy Casino Riverside, partially offset by decreased gaming revenue at Argosy Casino Alton partly due to flooding which occurred in May 2017, and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, primarily due to continued impact of competition in Ohio.\nGaming revenue for our South/West segment increased by $44.4 million in 2017, primarily due to the acquisitions of 1st Jackpot and Resorts on May 1, 2017, which contributed a combined $44.2 million of gaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased gaming revenue at Tropicana Las Vegas, M Resort and Zia Park, as the local economy has shown improvements over the second half of the year, partially offset by decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast and Boomtown Biloxi, both of which were negatively impacted by Hurricane Nate in October 2017 and decreased gaming revenue at Hollywood Casino Tunica.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nGaming revenue increased by $108.8 million, or 4.4%, to $2,606.3 million in 2016, primarily due to the variances explained below.\nGaming revenue for our Northeast segment increased by $59.1 million in 2016, primarily due to a full year of operations at Plainridge Park Casino, which opened on June 24, 2015, which increased gaming revenue by $67.0 million, improved results at Hollywood Casino Columbus, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Racecourse, which together increased gaming revenues $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

expense\nInterest expense increased by $7.5 million, or 1.6%, to $466.8 million in 2017, primarily due to $5.8 million higher interest payments on the financing obligation to GLPI due to the acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts on May 1, 2017 and the incurrence of rent escalators, $5.0 million from higher borrowing levels on the senior unsecured notes, partially offset by $2.5 million from lower borrowing levels and interest rates on the revolver portion of the senior secured credit facility and $0.7 million lower accretion on the relocation fees for Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course.\nInterest expense increased by $16.1 million, or 3.6%, to $459.2 million in 2016, primarily due to $11.9 million from higher borrowings on the Term Loan A and revolver portions of the senior secured credit facility during year ended December 31, 2016, compared to prior year, lower capitalized interest of $1.7 million and higher payments of $1.7 million from the rent escalator on the financing obligation to GLPI.\nInterest income\nInterest income decreased by $20.6 million, or 85.3%, to $3.6 million in 2017, primarily due to lower interest accrued on the loan to the JIVDC due to their refinancing on October 20, 2016 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).\nInterest income increased by $12.7 million, or 109.7%, to $24.2 million in 2016, primarily due to higher interest accrued on the loan to the JIVDC (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).\nIncome from unconsolidated affiliates\nIncome from unconsolidated affiliates increased by $4.3 million, or 30.2%, to $18.7 million in 2017, primarily due to increased earnings related to our joint venture in Kansas Entertainment primarily due to higher year over year revenue.\nOther\nOther changed by $0.6 million, or 34.4%, to $(2.3) million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to costs associated with the January 2017 debt refinancing, partially offset by lower foreign currency translation losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther changed by $7.6 million, or 128.6%, to $(1.7) million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to foreign currency translation losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to foreign currency translation gains for 2015.\nTaxes\nOur income tax benefit from operations was $498.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to an income tax expense of $11.3 million in the prior year period. Our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes) was 1,990.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate in the current year is lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35% due to the effect of permanent items such as nondeductible goodwill amortization, stock compensation, and the contingent liability settlement, as well as the decrease in our valuation allowance during the year compared to the corresponding prior year period , which is partially offset by the effects of the deferred federal income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% due to income tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our low level of pre tax earnings has magnified the impact of the above items on our effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nWe recorded a net charge of $266.0 million included in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consisting of three components: (i) a $261.3 million charge due to the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. based on the new lower federal income tax rate, (ii) a $2.6 million charge related to the one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred earnings from our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary (which we will pay interest free over 8 years) and (iii) a $2.1 million foreign withholding tax charge due to the new favorable U.S. treatment of foreign dividends whereby we have changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion. While we believe the $266.0 million net charge represents a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the Tax Act in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as of December 31, 2017, these amounts are considered provisional.\nOur effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings and the level of our tax credits. Certain of these and other factors, including our history and projections of pre tax earnings, are considered in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against the federal and state net deferred tax assets for the portion that will be realized. As such, the Company released $741.9 million of its total valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $113.7 million as of December 31, 2017 for federal capital loss carryforwards, as well as certain state filing groups, where it continues to be in a cumulative three-year pretax loss position.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA is used by management as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock\ncompensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for our joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our Master Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business, and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. We also present adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors and creditors as an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations, including our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. In addition, gaming companies have historically reported adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their adjusted EBITDA calculations certain corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented as a supplemental disclosure, as management believes that it is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry, is used in the valuation of gaming companies, and that it is considered by many to be a key indicator of the Company's operating results. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. It should also be noted that other gaming companies that report adjusted EBITDA information may calculate adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than the Company and therefore, comparability may be limited.\nA reconciliation of the Company's net income per GAAP adjusted EBITDA, as well as the Company's income from operations per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, is included below. Additionally, a reconciliation of each segment's income (loss) from operations to adjusted EBITDA is also included above. On a segment level, income (loss) from operations per GAAP, rather than net income (loss) per GAAP is reconciled to adjusted EBITDA due to, among other things, the impracticability of allocating interest expense, interest income, income taxes and certain other items to the Company's segments on a segment by segment basis. Management believes that this presentation is important to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's segments and is consistent with the reporting of other gaming companies.\nThe reconciliation of the Company's income (loss) from operations per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the Company's net income per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

by $12.2 million, or 2.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to improved results at all four of our Ohio properties and Plainridge Park Casino, partially offset by lower Adjusted EBITDA at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races due to increased competition from the Maryland market.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Midwest segment increased by $10.5 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to improved results at Argosy Casino Riverside and Prairie State Gaming which benefited from the acquisition of two smaller VGT route operators during the year, partially offset by lower adjusted EBITDA at Hollywood Casino Joliet and Hollywood Casino St. Louis.\nAdjust EBITDA for our South/West segment increased by $6.8 million, or 5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of 1st Jackpot and Resorts on May 1, 2017, which contributed adjusted EBITDA of $8.6 million, improved results at M Resort and Zia Park Casino, as the local economy has shown improvements in the second half of 2017, partially offset by lower adjusted EBITDA at Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast due to impacts from Hurricane Nate in October 2017 and at Tropicana Las Vegas, primarily due to negative impacts in the fourth quarter following the tragic shootings and a favorable litigation settlement in the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Other decreased by $27.3 million, or 44.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased corporate overhead costs of $34.8 million, primarily due to higher cash-settled stock-based compensation charges of $23.0 million mainly due to higher Penn stock price during 2017 compared to 2016, higher acquisition and development costs of $9.4 million as well as increased bonus expense of $3.5 million due to the Company's better overall performance against its budget, partially offset by a full year of earnings from Rocket Speed, which was acquired on August 1, 2016.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Northeast segment increased by $32.5 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a full year of operations for Plainridge Park Casino, which opened on June 24, 2015, improved results at all of our Ohio properties, which together increased adjusted EBITDA by $11.5 million, partially offset by decreased adjusted EBITDA at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, primarily due to the continued impact of competition of in the region, namely Maryland Live!, Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, and MGM National Harbor, which opened in December 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Midwest segment decreased by $4.0 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to decreased EBITDA at Hollywood St. Louis as a result of a $15.4 million property tax credit received during 2015, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg as a result of a $2.0 million property tax refund received in the first quarter of 2015, and Argosy Casino Alton due to flooding during the first quarter 2016, which resulted in declines in business volumes and difficulty recovering lost business, partially offset by increased adjusted EBITDA from a full year of operations of Prairie State Gaming which was acquired on September 1, 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Other increased by $19.3 million, or 24.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to decreased corporate overhead costs of $11.7 million, primarily due to lower cash settled stock based compensation charges of $7.8 million mainly due to stock price decreases for Penn and GLPI common stock during 2016 compared to stock price increases in 2015, as well as decreased bonus expense of $2.7 million. Penn Interactive Ventures also increased adjusted EBITDA by $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth from our HollywoodCasino.com social gaming business and the acquisition of Rocket Speed on August 1, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically and prospectively, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been and will be cash flow from operations, borrowings from banks and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $459.1 million, $411.7 million, and $413.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was comprised primarily of an increase in cash receipts from customers of $109.2 million, primarily due to the acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts on May 1, 2017, Rocket Speed on August 1, 2016 and four smaller acquisitions by Prairie State Gaming since the fourth quarter 2016 and an increase in income tax refunds of $32.1 million, offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and vendors of $37.6 million, primarily due to the acquisitions noted above, a reduction of $23.0 million in interest income collections resulting from the refinancing of the Jamul loan in October 2016, cash payments for the early extinguishment of debt of $18.0 million and an increase in cash paid to employees of $15.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $221.6 million, $79.3 million, and $781.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities of $142.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily due the $273.9 million received from the refinancing of loans to the Jamul Tribe in the prior year, cash payments of $42.5 million primarily related to the acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts and decreased proceeds related to the sale of assets held for sale of $17.2 million primarily from the sale of Rosecroft Raceway in 2016. All of which were partially offset by $183.3 million decrease in loan to the JIVDC and $8.2 million of principal and interest collections applied against the nonaccrual loan to the JIVDC.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities totaled $(189.0) million, $(339.9) million, and $395.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities of $150.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher proceeds from our long-term debt of $1,308.0 million, due to the refinancing of corporate debt, and higher proceeds of $82.6 million from GLPI for financing the acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts. All of which were partially offset by higher principal payments on long-term debt of $1,167.3 million due to the previously mentioned refinancing, payments of $24.8 million relating to the repurchase of common stock, higher payments of $17.8 million primarily relating to a buy out of the contingent purchase price obligation with Rocket Speed, higher payments on other long-term obligations of $21.7 million and higher principal payments on the financing obligation with GLPI of $7.3 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are accounted for as either project capital or maintenance (replacement) capital expenditures. Project capital expenditures are for fixed asset additions that expand an existing facility or create a new facility. Maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to replace existing fixed assets with a useful life greater than one year that are obsolete, worn out or no longer cost effective to repair.\nThe following table summarizes our project capital expenditures by segment for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nActual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSouth/West (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMidwest (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital expenditures from our South/West segment are related to the improvements at the Tropicana Las Vegas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapital expenditures from our Midwest segment are related to hotel improvements at Hollywood St. Louis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, we made further enhancements to our Tropicana Las Vegas facility including adding a celebrity chef restaurant, the Robert Irvine Public House, which opened on July 27, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we spent $68.8 million on maintenance capital expenditures, with $22.6 million in our Northeast segment, $17.2 million in our South/West segment, $24.2 million in our Midwest segment, and $4.8 million in Other.

See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn October 30, 2013, the Company entered into a new senior secured credit facility. The new senior secured credit facility consists of a five year $500 million revolver, a five year $500 million Term Loan A facility, and a seven year $250 million Term Loan B facility. The Term Loan A facility was priced at LIBOR plus a spread (ranging from 2.75% to 1.25%) based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined in the new senior secured credit facility. The Term Loan B facility was priced at LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a 0.75% LIBOR floor.\nOn April 28, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to amend its senior secured credit facility. In August 2015, the amendment to the senior secured credit facility went into effect increasing the capacity under an existing five year revolver from $500 million to $633.2 million and increased the existing five year $500 million Term Loan A facility by $146.7 million. The seven year $250 million Term Loan B facility remained unchanged.\nOn January 19, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility. The amended and restated senior secured credit facility consists of a five year $700 million revolver, a five year $300 million Term Loan A facility, and a seven year $500 million Term Loan B facility (the Amended Credit Facilities\u201d). The Term Loan A facility was priced at LIBOR plus a spread (ranging from 3.00% to 1.25%) based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined in the new senior secured credit facility. The Term Loan B facility was priced at LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a 0.75% LIBOR floor. At December 31, 2017, the Company's senior secured credit facility had a gross outstanding balance of $760.0 million, consisting of a $288.8 million Term Loan A facility and a $471.2 million Term Loan B facility. The revolving credit facility had nothing drawn at December 31, 2017.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had conditional obligations under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with face amounts aggregating $22.1 million and $23.0 million, respectively, resulting in $677.9 million and $419.1 million of available borrowing capacity as of December 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the repayment of the previous senior secured credit facility, the Company recorded $1.7 million in refinancing costs and a $2.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and the discount on the Term Loan B facility of the previous senior secured credit facility.\nThe payment and performance of obligations under the senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets (other than excluded property such as gaming licenses) of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn October 30, 2013, the Company completed an offering of $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2021 (the 5.875% Notes\u201d) at a price of par. Interest on the 5.875% Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 5.875% Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.875% Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries except in the event that the Company in the future issues certain subsidiary guaranteed debt securities. The Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from time to time, on or after November 1, 2016, at the declining redemption premiums set forth in the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to November 1, 2016, the Company may redeem the 5.875% Notes at any time, and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes redeemed plus a make whole\u201d redemption premium described in the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, the 5.875% Notes may be redeemed prior to November 1, 2016 from net proceeds raised in connection with an equity offering as long as the Company pays 105.875% of the principal amount of the 5.875% Notes, redeems the 5.875% Notes within 180 days of completing the equity offering, and at least 60% of the 5.875% Notes originally issued remains outstanding.\nThe Company used the proceeds of the new senior secured credit facility, new 5.875% Notes, and cash on hand, to repay its previous senior secured credit facility, to fund the cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its previously issued 83/4% senior subordinated notes ( 83/4% Notes\u201d)and the related consent solicitation to make certain amendments to the indenture governing the 83/4% Notes, to satisfy and discharge such indenture, to pay related fees and expenses and for working capital purposes.\nRedemption of 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the Company redeemed all of its $300 million 5.875% senior subordinated notes, which were due in 2021 ( 5.875% Notes\u201d). In connection with this redemption, the Company recorded a $21.1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the difference between the reacquisition price of the 5.875% Notes compared to its carrying value.\n5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn January 19, 2017, the Company completed an offering of $400 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes that mature on January 15, 2027 (the 5.625% Notes\u201d) at a price of par. Interest on the 5.625% Notes is payable on January 15th and July 15th of each year. The 5.625% Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.625% Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries except in the event that the Company in the future issues certain subsidiary guaranteed debt securities. The Company may redeem the 5.625% Notes at any time on or after January 15, 2022, at the declining redemption premiums set forth in the indenture governing the 5.625% Notes, and, prior to January 15, 2022, at a make-whole\u201d redemption premium set forth in the indenture governing the 5.625%\nNotes. In addition, prior to January 15, 2020, the Company may redeem the 5.625% Notes with an amount equal to the net proceeds from one or more equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to 105.625% of the principal amount of the 5.625% Notes redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, so long as at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding and such redemption occurs within 180 days of closing of the related equity offering.\nThe Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 5.625% Notes to retire its existing 5.875% Notes and to fund related transaction fees and expenses.\nThe Company used loans funded under the Amended Credit Facilities and a portion of the proceeds of the 5.625% Notes to repay amounts outstanding under its then existing Credit Agreement and to fund related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nFinancing obligation with GLPI\nThe Company's Master Lease with GLPI that became effective November 1, 2013 was accounted for as a financing obligation and totaled $3.54 billion and $3.51 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the inception of the lease, the Company determined that the lease term should include all option periods since renewal was reasonably assured given the high percentage of earnings from the Master Lease properties operations to the Company and the lack of alternative economically feasible leasing options for such real estate. The future minimum lease payments at lease inception were discounted at 9.7% which represented the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate over the term of the lease. The financing obligation increased by $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year due to the addition of $82.6 million in connection with the acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts, partially offset by principal payment reductions. Interest expense recognized on this obligation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $397.6 million and $391.7 million, respectively.\nOther Long-Term Obligations\nOther long term obligations at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $119.3 million and $154.1 million, respectively, included $105.4 million and $118.9 million, respectively, related to the relocation fees for Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $13.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively, related to the repayment obligation of a hotel and event center located near Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. The December 31, 2016 long term obligations included $20.8 million related to a corporate airplane loan; all of which are more fully described below.\nIn June 2013, the Company finalized the terms of its memorandum of understanding with the State of Ohio, which included an agreement by the Company to pay a relocation fee in return for being able to relocate its existing racetracks in Toledo and Grove City to Dayton and Mahoning Valley, respectively. Upon opening of these two racinos in Ohio in the third quarter of 2014, the relocation fee for each new racino was recorded at the present value of the contractual obligation, which was calculated to be $75 million based on the 5% discount rate included in the agreement. The relocation fee for each facility is payable as follows: $7.5 million upon the opening of the facility and eighteen semi-annual payments of $4.8 million beginning one year from the commencement of operations. This obligation is accreted to interest expense at an effective yield of 5.0%. The amount included in interest expense related to this obligation was $5.5 million and $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively\nThe City of Lawrenceburg Department of Redevelopment completed construction of a hotel and event center located less than a mile away from Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. Effective in mid-January 2015, by contractual agreement, a repayment obligation for the hotel and event center was assumed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $15.3 million, which was financed through a loan with the City of Lawrenceburg Department of Redevelopment, in exchange for conveyance of the property. The Company is obligated to make annual payments on the loan of approximately $1 million for twenty years beginning January 2016. This obligation is accreted to interest\nexpense at its effective yield of 3.0%. The amount included in interest expense related to this obligation was $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCorporate Airplane Loan\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company acquired a previously leased corporate airplane that was accounted for as a capital lease and financed the purchase price with an amortizing loan at a fixed interest rate of 5.22% for a term of five years with monthly payments of $220 thousand and a balloon payment of $12.6 million at the end of the loan term. The loan was subsequently repaid in full on January 19, 2017.\nCovenants\nThe Company's senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes require us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests, including fixed charge coverage, interest coverage, senior leverage and total leverage ratios. In addition, the Company's senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes restrict, among other things, its ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, make investments, engage in mergers or consolidations, and otherwise restrict corporate activities.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants.\nOutlook\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe that cash generated from operations and cash on hand, together with amounts available under our senior secured credit facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated Master Lease obligations, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our anticipated earnings projections will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures. In addition, we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations, greenfield projects, jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under-penetrated markets. If we consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions, our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Capital Structure\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks related to our capital structure.\nWe have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage to pursue opportunities in the marketplace and in an effort to maximize our enterprise value for our shareholders. We expect to meet our debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from operations and/or refinancing them through the debt or equity markets prior to their maturity.\nWe expect to fund the anticipated acquisition of Pinnacle with a combination of proceeds from asset divestitures and the sale-leaseback of Plainridge Park Casino, existing cash on our balance sheet, new debt financing and internally generated cash flow prior to the acquisition. We anticipate that the additional cash flow resulting from the acquisition will allow us to pay down debt on an accelerated basis after closing.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Cash Obligations\nAt December 31, 2017, there was approximately $677.9 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company issued a press release summarizing its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. These results included an impairment charge of $48.5 million on the Company's loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC. In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May. As a result, the Company recorded an additional charge of $29.4 million on the loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Operations\nWe are a leading, geographically diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal operations. In 2015, we launched our interactive gaming strategy through our subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures which focuses on social gaming products.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-nine facilities in the following seventeen jurisdictions: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario, Canada.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue, derived primarily from gaming on slot machines (which represented approximately 87% of our gaming revenue in 2017 and 2016 and to a lesser extent, table games, which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties. Other revenues are derived from our management service fees from Casino Rama, our hotel, dining, retail, admissions, program sales, concessions and certain other ancillary activities, and our racing operations. Our racing revenue includes our share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and our share of wagering from our off-track wagering facilities.\nKey performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage. Our typical property slot hold percentage is in the range of 6% to 10% of slot handle, and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of 16% to 26% of table game drop.\nSlot handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. The win or hold percentage is the net amount of gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for accruals related to the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Our slot hold percentages have consistently been in the 6% to 10% range over the past several years. Given the stability in our slot hold percentages, we have not experienced significant impacts to earnings from changes in these percentages.\nFor table games, customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables. The cash and markers (extensions of credit granted to certain credit worthy customers) are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. Table game win is the amount of drop that is retained and recorded as casino gaming revenue, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for unredeemed gaming chips. As we are primarily focused on regional gaming markets, our table win percentages are fairly stable as the majority of these markets do not regularly experience high-end play, which can lead to volatility in win percentages. Therefore, changes in table game win percentages do not typically have a material impact to our earnings.\nOur properties generate significant operating cash flow, since most of our revenue is cash-based from slot machines, table games, and pari-mutuel wagering. Our business is capital intensive, and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to satisfy our obligations under the Master Lease, repay debt, fund maintenance capital expenditures, fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions.\nWe continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. Additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nSegment Information\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), as that term is defined in ASC 280, measures and assesses the Company's business performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations.\nThe Northeast reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Casino Toledo, Hollywood Casino Columbus, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, and Plainridge Park Casino, which opened on June 24, 2015. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service contract.\nThe South/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino, Hollywood Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, Boomtown Biloxi, M Resort, Tropicana Las Vegas, which was acquired on August 25, 2015, 1st Jackpot and Resorts which were acquired on May 1, 2017, as well as our management contract with Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego, which opened on October 10, 2016.\nThe Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, and Prairie State Gaming, which the Company acquired on September 1, 2015, and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC ( Kansas Entertainment\u201d), which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway.\nThe Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, which was sold on July 31, 2016, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes the Company's corporate overhead operations, which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280. Additionally, the Other category includes Penn Interactive Ventures, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary that represents its social online gaming initiatives, including Rocket Speed. Penn Interactive Ventures meets the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280, but is quantitatively not significant to the Company's operations as it represents less than 2% of net revenues and 5% of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its total assets represent less than 2% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel and believes it is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with the Company's share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for its joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our\nMaster Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction is accounted for as a financing obligation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to income from operations, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA.\nExecutive Summary\nAs reported by most jurisdictions, regional gaming industry trends have shown little revenue growth in recent years as numerous jurisdictions now permit gaming or have expanded their gaming offerings. The proliferation of new gaming facilities continues to impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as our operating results in certain markets. However, the current economic environment, specifically low unemployment levels, strengths in residential real estate prices, and higher levels of consumer confidence, has resulted in a stable operating environment in recent periods. Our ability to continue to succeed in this environment will be predicated on operating our existing facilities efficiently and offering our customers additional gaming experiences through our multi-channel distribution strategy. We will also seek to continue to expand our customer database through accretive acquisitions and capitalize on organic growth opportunities from our recent facility openings and new business lines.\nWe operate a geographically diversified portfolio comprised largely of new and well maintained regional gaming facilities. This has allowed us to develop what we believe to be a solid base for future growth opportunities supported by a flexible and attractively priced capital structure. We have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit and/or expand gaming in these jurisdictions and we are selected as a licensee.\nHistorically, the Company has been reliant on certain key regional gaming markets (for example, its results from Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). Over the past several years, we have diversified our operations via development of new facilities and acquisitions and we anticipate further reducing our reliance on specific properties subsequent to the closing of the Pinnacle transaction.\nOn December 18, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Pinnacle in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion inclusive of assumed indebtedness. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $20.00 in cash and 0.42 shares of Penn common stock for each Pinnacle share.\nCoincident with the closing, we plan to divest the membership interests of certain Pinnacle subsidiaries which operate the casinos known as Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (Missouri), Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (Missouri), Belterra Casino Resort (Indiana), and Belterra Park (Ohio) to Boyd Gaming Corp ( Boyd\u201d) for approximately $575 million in cash. These divestitures are anticipated to occur immediately prior to, and are conditioned upon, the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition. Additionally, at the closing of the merger, (i) GLPI will acquire the real estate associated with the Plainridge Park Casino for $250 million, and concurrently be leased back to Penn pursuant to the amended Pinnacle master lease for a fixed annual rent of $25 million and (ii) GLPI will acquire the real estate assets of Belterra Park from Penn for approximately $65 million, which subsequently will be included in an amended master lease between GLPI and Boyd. The amended Pinnacle Master Lease will be adjusted for incremental rent of $13.9 million to adjust to market conditions.\nWe will have significantly greater operational and geographic diversity and operate a combined 41 properties in 20 jurisdictions throughout North America. The transaction is expected to generate $100 million in annual run-rate cost synergies achieved within 24 months of closing. We also believe the transaction will present opportunities with respect to increased Las Vegas visitation and higher social gaming revenues from the enhanced scale and size of the customer database.\nPenn has received committed financing for the transaction, subject to customary conditions, from BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of the proceeds from the Boyd and GLPI transactions, existing cash on its balance sheet and new debt financing. Penn anticipates that the additional cash flow resulting from the acquisition will allow it to pay down debt on an accelerated basis after closing.\nThe transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is now subject to approval of the shareholders of Penn and Pinnacle, the approval of applicable gaming authorities, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2018.\nUpon completion of the transaction, former Penn and Pinnacle shareholders will hold 78 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of the combined company's outstanding shares.\nFinancial Highlights:\nWe reported net revenues and income from operations of $3,148.0 million and $445.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net revenues and income from operations of $3,034.4 million and $543.0 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in the prior year. The major factors affecting our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, were:\n \u00b7 Provision for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC of $89.8 million and goodwill impairment charges of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to no charges in 2016. \n \u00b7 A $25.1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and finance charges related to the January 2017 refinancing of our senior secured credit facility, redemption of the $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes and issuance of $400 million of new 5.625% senior unsecured notes. \n \u00b7 The acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts in our South/West segment, which generated net revenues of $46.4 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 The acquisition of Rocket Speed on August 1, 2016 in our Other segment, which generated net revenues of $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (which only represented five months of activity given its acquisition date). \n \u00b7 During the third quarter 2017, Penn Interactive Ventures reached an agreement with the former shareholders of Rocket Speed to buy out the two year contingent purchase price consideration which resulted in a benefit to general and administrative expense in the amount of $22.2 million. \n \u00b7 Increased competition in our Northeast segment from the Baltimore, Maryland market, primarily due to the opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016. \n \u00b7 Lower depreciation and amortization expense of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. \n \u00b7 We had net income of $473.5 million and $109.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the variances discussed above, as well as lower income taxes resulting from a $741.9 million tax valuation allowance reversal for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was partially \n offset by a $261.3 million deferred tax asset write-off due to the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lower interest income, and increased interest expense primarily due to higher borrowings on our Term Loan A and our senior unsecured notes. \nSegment Developments:\nThe following are recent developments that have had, may have or will have an impact on us by segment:\nDuring 2017, we engaged third party consultants to help us validate and quantify a new set of strategic initiatives which we expect will improve our already industry-leading property level operating margins in the coming years. This effort encompassed both revenue and cost saving initiatives throughout the organization which we expect to realize recurring benefits over the next several years.\nNortheast\n \u00b7 In October 2017, Pennsylvania's House Bill 271 was signed into law. The bill extensively expands gambling in the state by introducing licenses for up to ten additional casinos limited to 750 slot machines and up to 40 table games not to be within twenty-five miles of existing casinos, up to five video gaming terminals at certain truck stops, online gambling, fantasy contests and sport wagering. We believe Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course may be impacted by new competition in the near future based on the ultimate location of the additional facilities. \n \u00b7 Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races faced increased competition from the Baltimore, Maryland market, which includes Maryland Live!, Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, which opened at the end of August 2014 and MGM National Harbor, which opened in December 2016. \n \u00b7 Construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts that was expected to open in 2017, is currently on hold following a judicial opinion. MGM Springfield in Western Massachusetts is expected to be completed in September 2018 and Wynn Everett in Eastern Massachusetts is scheduled to open in mid-2019. The increased competition in Massachusetts will have a negative impact on the operations of Plainridge Park Casino. \n \u00b7 The management service contract with Casino Rama in Ontario, Canada is expected to end in the third quarter of 2018. \nSouth/West\n \u00b7 On May 1, 2017, we acquired RIH Acquisitions MS I, LLC and RIH Acquisitions MS II, LLC, the holding companies for operations of 1st Jackpot Casino and Resorts Casino, in Tunica, Mississippi. \n \u00b7 On October 10, 2016, we opened and began to manage Hollywood Casino Jamul - San Diego on the Jamul Tribe's trust land in San-Diego California. During 2017, our loan to the JIVDC went into default and as a result Penn incurred impairment charges related to its loan and funding commitments of $89.8 million. In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May. \n \u00b7 In August 2015 we completed the acquisition of Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino for $360 million. During the second quarter of 2016, we refreshed the gaming floor with new slot machines and launched our \n Marquee Rewards player loyalty program at the Tropicana Las Vegas. During 2017, we made various incremental food and beverage offerings at the facility and on July 27, 2017, we opened celebrity chef Robert Irvine's first signature Las Vegas restaurant, the Robert Irvine Public House. Additionally, we continue to evaluate additional improvements at the property which may include additional food, beverage, retail and entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and enhancements in future periods. \nMidwest\n \u00b7 On September 1, 2015, we acquired a leading Illinois video gaming terminal ( VGT\u201d) operator, Prairie State Gaming. As one of the largest and most respected VGT route operators in Illinois, Prairie State Gaming's operations include more than 1,715 terminals across a network of 377 bars and retail gaming establishments throughout Illinois. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired two small video gaming terminal route operators in Illinois. In addition, during the first half of 2017, we acquired two additional small video gaming route operators in Illinois. \nOther\n \u00b7 On August 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rocket Speed, a leading developer of social casino games. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the accounting for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and loans to the JIVDC as critical accounting estimates, as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nWe believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.\nThe development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nLong-lived assets\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a net property and equipment balance of $2,756.7 million within our consolidated balance sheet, representing 52.7% of total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment,\u201d assets are grouped at the individual property level representing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions\nregarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $1,008.1 million in goodwill and $422.6 million in other intangible assets within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 19.3% and 8.1% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses. These assets require significant management estimates and judgment pertaining to: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and (ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.\nIn connection with the Company's acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of the Company's due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. An income approach, in which a discounted cash flow model is utilized and a market-based approach utilizing guideline public company ( GPC\u201d) multiples of adjusted EBTIDA from the Company's peer group is utilized to estimate the fair market value of the Company's reporting units.\nFor the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a GPC multiples approach which is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. The Company adjusts the carrying value of each reporting unit that utilizes property that is subject to the Master Lease by an allocation of a pro-rata portion of the GLPI financing obligation based on the reporting unit's estimated fair value as a percentage of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units that utilize property that is subject to the Master Lease.\nThe Company compares the aggregate weighted average fair value to the carrying value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the aggregate weighted average fair value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount of the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other,\u201d the Company considers its gaming licenses and certain other intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on the Company's future expectations to operate its gaming facilities indefinitely (notwithstanding our experience in 2014 in Iowa which the Company concluded was an isolated incident and the first time in the Company's history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause it to lose its gaming license) as well as its historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state commissions. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite life intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company completes its testing of its intangible assets prior to assessing the realizability of its goodwill.\nThe Company assessed the fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets (which are primarily gaming licenses) using the Greenfield Method under the income approach. The Greenfield Method estimates the fair value of the gaming license using a discounted cash flow model assuming the Company built a casino with similar utility to that of the existing facility. The method assumes a theoretical start up company going into business without any assets other than the intangible asset being valued. As such, the value of the gaming license is a function of the following items:\n \u00b7 Projected revenues and operating cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing payments to its reporting units consistent with how the GLPI financing obligation is allocated); \n \u00b7 Theoretical construction costs and duration; \n \u00b7 Pre-opening expenses; and \n \u00b7 Discounting that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows attributable to the license. \nThe evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing. The implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing obligation to its reporting units) that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent the Company's best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition. Changes in estimates, increases in the Company's cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, changes in operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates. If the Company's ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, the Company may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. The Company's estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where it conducts operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, or other events affecting the Company's properties.\nForecasted cash flows (based on the Company's annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter) can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which its reporting units operate. For example, increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and/or lower customer spend per visit. In addition, the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where the Company's reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for the Company to expand its operations. However, it also has the impact of increasing competition for the Company's established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations' profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations. Additionally, increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted cash flows.\nAssumptions and estimates about future cash flow levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective. They are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as industry, geopolitical and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in the Company's business strategy, which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance its overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit.\nConsistent with prior years, the Company's annual goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets impairment test is performed on October 1st of each year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $18.0 million, related to the goodwill at Tropicana Las Vegas and Sanford Orlando Kennel Club.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded other intangible assets impairment charges of $40.0 million, as of the valuation date of October 1, 2015, related to the write-off of our Plainridge Park Casino gaming license and a partial write-down of the gaming license at Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway due to a reduction in the long term earnings forecast at both of these locations.\nConsistent with prior years, we believe at this time all of our reporting units with goodwill and other intangible assets are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges. This", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company issued a press release summarizing its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. These results included an impairment charge of $48.5 million on the Company's loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC. In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May. As a result, the Company recorded an additional charge of $29.4 million on the loan and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Operations\nWe are a leading, geographically diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal operations. In 2015, we launched our interactive gaming strategy through our subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures which focuses on social gaming products.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-nine facilities in the following seventeen jurisdictions: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario, Canada.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue, derived primarily from gaming on slot machines (which represented approximately 87% of our gaming revenue in 2017 and 2016 and to a lesser extent, table games, which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties. Other revenues are derived from our management service fees from Casino Rama, our hotel, dining, retail, admissions, program sales, concessions and certain other ancillary activities, and our racing operations. Our racing revenue includes our share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting, and our share of wagering from our off-track wagering facilities.\nKey performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage. Our typical property slot hold percentage is in the range of 6% to 10% of slot handle, and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of 16% to 26% of table game drop.\nSlot handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. The win or hold percentage is the net amount of gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for accruals related to the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Our slot hold percentages have consistently been in the 6% to 10% range over the past several years. Given the stability in our slot hold percentages, we have not experienced significant impacts to earnings from changes in these percentages.\nFor table games, customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables. The cash and markers (extensions of credit granted to certain credit worthy customers) are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. Table game win is the amount of drop that is retained and recorded as casino gaming revenue, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for unredeemed gaming chips. As we are primarily focused on regional gaming markets, our table win percentages are fairly stable as the majority of these markets do not regularly experience high-end play, which can lead to volatility in win percentages. Therefore, changes in table game win percentages do not typically have a material impact to our earnings.\nOur properties generate significant operating cash flow, since most of our revenue is cash-based from slot machines, table games, and pari-mutuel wagering. Our business is capital intensive, and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to satisfy our obligations under the Master Lease, repay debt, fund maintenance capital expenditures, fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions.\nWe continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets. Additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures\u201d below.\nSegment Information\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), as that term is defined in ASC 280, measures and assesses the Company's business performance based on regional operations of various properties grouped together based primarily on their geographic locations.\nThe Northeast reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Casino Toledo, Hollywood Casino Columbus, Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, and Plainridge Park Casino, which opened on June 24, 2015. It also includes the Company's Casino Rama management service contract.\nThe South/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Zia Park Casino, Hollywood Casino Tunica, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, Boomtown Biloxi, M Resort, Tropicana Las Vegas, which was acquired on August 25, 2015, 1st Jackpot and Resorts which were acquired on May 1, 2017, as well as our management contract with Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego, which opened on October 10, 2016.\nThe Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Argosy Casino Riverside, Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, and Prairie State Gaming, which the Company acquired on September 1, 2015, and includes the Company's 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, LLC ( Kansas Entertainment\u201d), which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway.\nThe Other category consists of the Company's standalone racing operations, namely Rosecroft Raceway, which was sold on July 31, 2016, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and the Company's joint venture interests in Sam Houston Race Park, Valley Race Park, and Freehold Raceway. If the Company is successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of the Company's regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes the Company's corporate overhead operations, which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280. Additionally, the Other category includes Penn Interactive Ventures, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary that represents its social online gaming initiatives, including Rocket Speed. Penn Interactive Ventures meets the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280, but is quantitatively not significant to the Company's operations as it represents less than 2% of net revenues and 5% of income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, and its total assets represent less than 2% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel and believes it is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with the Company's share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for its joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our\nMaster Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction is accounted for as a financing obligation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to income from operations, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA.\nExecutive Summary\nAs reported by most jurisdictions, regional gaming industry trends have shown little revenue growth in recent years as numerous jurisdictions now permit gaming or have expanded their gaming offerings. The proliferation of new gaming facilities continues to impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as our operating results in certain markets. However, the current economic environment, specifically low unemployment levels, strengths in residential real estate prices, and higher levels of consumer confidence, has resulted in a stable operating environment in recent periods. Our ability to continue to succeed in this environment will be predicated on operating our existing facilities efficiently and offering our customers additional gaming experiences through our multi-channel distribution strategy. We will also seek to continue to expand our customer database through accretive acquisitions and capitalize on organic growth opportunities from our recent facility openings and new business lines.\nWe operate a geographically diversified portfolio comprised largely of new and well maintained regional gaming facilities. This has allowed us to develop what we believe to be a solid base for future growth opportunities supported by a flexible and attractively priced capital structure. We have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit and/or expand gaming in these jurisdictions and we are selected as a licensee.\nHistorically, the Company has been reliant on certain key regional gaming markets (for example, its results from Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). Over the past several years, we have diversified our operations via development of new facilities and acquisitions and we anticipate further reducing our reliance on specific properties subsequent to the closing of the Pinnacle transaction.\nOn December 18, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Pinnacle in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion inclusive of assumed indebtedness. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $20.00 in cash and 0.42 shares of Penn common stock for each Pinnacle share.\nCoincident with the closing, we plan to divest the membership interests of certain Pinnacle subsidiaries which operate the casinos known as Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (Missouri), Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (Missouri), Belterra Casino Resort (Indiana), and Belterra Park (Ohio) to Boyd Gaming Corp ( Boyd\u201d) for approximately $575 million in cash. These divestitures are anticipated to occur immediately prior to, and are conditioned upon, the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition. Additionally, at the closing of the merger, (i) GLPI will acquire the real estate associated with the Plainridge Park Casino for $250 million, and concurrently be leased back to Penn pursuant to the amended Pinnacle master lease for a fixed annual rent of $25 million and (ii) GLPI will acquire the real estate assets of Belterra Park from Penn for approximately $65 million, which subsequently will be included in an amended master lease between GLPI and Boyd. The amended Pinnacle Master Lease will be adjusted for incremental rent of $13.9 million to adjust to market conditions.\nWe will have significantly greater operational and geographic diversity and operate a combined 41 properties in 20 jurisdictions throughout North America. The transaction is expected to generate $100 million in annual run-rate cost synergies achieved within 24 months of closing. We also believe the transaction will present opportunities with respect to increased Las Vegas visitation and higher social gaming revenues from the enhanced scale and size of the customer database.\nPenn has received committed financing for the transaction, subject to customary conditions, from BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of the proceeds from the Boyd and GLPI transactions, existing cash on its balance sheet and new debt financing. Penn anticipates that the additional cash flow resulting from the acquisition will allow it to pay down debt on an accelerated basis after closing.\nThe transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is now subject to approval of the shareholders of Penn and Pinnacle, the approval of applicable gaming authorities, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2018.\nUpon completion of the transaction, former Penn and Pinnacle shareholders will hold 78 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of the combined company's outstanding shares.\nFinancial Highlights:\nWe reported net revenues and income from operations of $3,148.0 million and $445.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net revenues and income from operations of $3,034.4 million and $543.0 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in the prior year. The major factors affecting our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, were:\n \u00b7 Provision for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments to the JIVDC of $89.8 million and goodwill impairment charges of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to no charges in 2016. \n \u00b7 A $25.1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and finance charges related to the January 2017 refinancing of our senior secured credit facility, redemption of the $300 million 5.875% senior unsecured notes and issuance of $400 million of new 5.625% senior unsecured notes. \n \u00b7 The acquisition of 1st Jackpot and Resorts in our South/West segment, which generated net revenues of $46.4 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 The acquisition of Rocket Speed on August 1, 2016 in our Other segment, which generated net revenues of $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (which only represented five months of activity given its acquisition date). \n \u00b7 During the third quarter 2017, Penn Interactive Ventures reached an agreement with the former shareholders of Rocket Speed to buy out the two year contingent purchase price consideration which resulted in a benefit to general and administrative expense in the amount of $22.2 million. \n \u00b7 Increased competition in our Northeast segment from the Baltimore, Maryland market, primarily due to the opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016. \n \u00b7 Lower depreciation and amortization expense of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. \n \u00b7 We had net income of $473.5 million and $109.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the variances discussed above, as well as lower income taxes resulting from a $741.9 million tax valuation allowance reversal for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was partially \n offset by a $261.3 million deferred tax asset write-off due to the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lower interest income, and increased interest expense primarily due to higher borrowings on our Term Loan A and our senior unsecured notes. \nSegment Developments:\nThe following are recent developments that have had, may have or will have an impact on us by segment:\nDuring 2017, we engaged third party consultants to help us validate and quantify a new set of strategic initiatives which we expect will improve our already industry-leading property level operating margins in the coming years. This effort encompassed both revenue and cost saving initiatives throughout the organization which we expect to realize recurring benefits over the next several years.\nNortheast\n \u00b7 In October 2017, Pennsylvania's House Bill 271 was signed into law. The bill extensively expands gambling in the state by introducing licenses for up to ten additional casinos limited to 750 slot machines and up to 40 table games not to be within twenty-five miles of existing casinos, up to five video gaming terminals at certain truck stops, online gambling, fantasy contests and sport wagering. We believe Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course may be impacted by new competition in the near future based on the ultimate location of the additional facilities. \n \u00b7 Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races faced increased competition from the Baltimore, Maryland market, which includes Maryland Live!, Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, which opened at the end of August 2014 and MGM National Harbor, which opened in December 2016. \n \u00b7 Construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts that was expected to open in 2017, is currently on hold following a judicial opinion. MGM Springfield in Western Massachusetts is expected to be completed in September 2018 and Wynn Everett in Eastern Massachusetts is scheduled to open in mid-2019. The increased competition in Massachusetts will have a negative impact on the operations of Plainridge Park Casino. \n \u00b7 The management service contract with Casino Rama in Ontario, Canada is expected to end in the third quarter of 2018. \nSouth/West\n \u00b7 On May 1, 2017, we acquired RIH Acquisitions MS I, LLC and RIH Acquisitions MS II, LLC, the holding companies for operations of 1st Jackpot Casino and Resorts Casino, in Tunica, Mississippi. \n \u00b7 On October 10, 2016, we opened and began to manage Hollywood Casino Jamul - San Diego on the Jamul Tribe's trust land in San-Diego California. During 2017, our loan to the JIVDC went into default and as a result Penn incurred impairment charges related to its loan and funding commitments of $89.8 million. In late February 2018, the Company and the Jamul Tribe mutually agreed that Penn would no longer manage the facility or provide branding and development services on May 28, 2018. The company will provide a transition that it anticipates will last through approximately late May. \n \u00b7 In August 2015 we completed the acquisition of Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino for $360 million. During the second quarter of 2016, we refreshed the gaming floor with new slot machines and launched our \n Marquee Rewards player loyalty program at the Tropicana Las Vegas. During 2017, we made various incremental food and beverage offerings at the facility and on July 27, 2017, we opened celebrity chef Robert Irvine's first signature Las Vegas restaurant, the Robert Irvine Public House. Additionally, we continue to evaluate additional improvements at the property which may include additional food, beverage, retail and entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and enhancements in future periods. \nMidwest\n \u00b7 On September 1, 2015, we acquired a leading Illinois video gaming terminal ( VGT\u201d) operator, Prairie State Gaming. As one of the largest and most respected VGT route operators in Illinois, Prairie State Gaming's operations include more than 1,715 terminals across a network of 377 bars and retail gaming establishments throughout Illinois. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired two small video gaming terminal route operators in Illinois. In addition, during the first half of 2017, we acquired two additional small video gaming route operators in Illinois. \nOther\n \u00b7 On August 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rocket Speed, a leading developer of social casino games. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. We have identified the accounting for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and loans to the JIVDC as critical accounting estimates, as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nWe believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.\nThe development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the related disclosures, have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nLong-lived assets\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a net property and equipment balance of $2,756.7 million within our consolidated balance sheet, representing 52.7% of total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment,\u201d assets are grouped at the individual property level representing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions\nregarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. Such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non-cash component of operating income.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $1,008.1 million in goodwill and $422.6 million in other intangible assets within its consolidated balance sheet, representing 19.3% and 8.1% of total assets, respectively, resulting from the Company's acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses. These assets require significant management estimates and judgment pertaining to: (i) the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation; and (ii) the ongoing evaluation for impairment.\nIn connection with the Company's acquisitions, valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices. The factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of the Company's due diligence in connection with the acquisitions, projections for future operations, and data obtained from third-party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits of a business combination measured as the excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. An income approach, in which a discounted cash flow model is utilized and a market-based approach utilizing guideline public company ( GPC\u201d) multiples of adjusted EBTIDA from the Company's peer group is utilized to estimate the fair market value of the Company's reporting units.\nFor the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a GPC multiples approach which is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. The Company adjusts the carrying value of each reporting unit that utilizes property that is subject to the Master Lease by an allocation of a pro-rata portion of the GLPI financing obligation based on the reporting unit's estimated fair value as a percentage of the aggregate estimated fair value of all reporting units that utilize property that is subject to the Master Lease.\nThe Company compares the aggregate weighted average fair value to the carrying value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the aggregate weighted average fair value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount of the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other,\u201d the Company considers its gaming licenses and certain other intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on the Company's future expectations to operate its gaming facilities indefinitely (notwithstanding our experience in 2014 in Iowa which the Company concluded was an isolated incident and the first time in the Company's history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause it to lose its gaming license) as well as its historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state commissions. Rather, these intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the indefinite life intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company completes its testing of its intangible assets prior to assessing the realizability of its goodwill.\nThe Company assessed the fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets (which are primarily gaming licenses) using the Greenfield Method under the income approach. The Greenfield Method estimates the fair value of the gaming license using a discounted cash flow model assuming the Company built a casino with similar utility to that of the existing facility. The method assumes a theoretical start up company going into business without any assets other than the intangible asset being valued. As such, the value of the gaming license is a function of the following items:\n \u00b7 Projected revenues and operating cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing payments to its reporting units consistent with how the GLPI financing obligation is allocated); \n \u00b7 Theoretical construction costs and duration; \n \u00b7 Pre-opening expenses; and \n \u00b7 Discounting that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows attributable to the license. \nThe evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing. The implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows (including an allocation of the Company's projected financing obligation to its reporting units) that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent the Company's best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition. Changes in estimates, increases in the Company's cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, changes in operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates. If the Company's ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, the Company may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. The Company's estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where it conducts operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, or other events affecting the Company's properties.\nForecasted cash flows (based on the Company's annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter) can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which its reporting units operate. For example, increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and/or lower customer spend per visit. In addition, the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where the Company's reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for the Company to expand its operations. However, it also has the impact of increasing competition for the Company's established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations' profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations. Additionally, increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted cash flows.\nAssumptions and estimates about future cash flow levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective. They are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as industry, geopolitical and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in the Company's business strategy, which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance its overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit.\nConsistent with prior years, the Company's annual goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets impairment test is performed on October 1st of each year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $18.0 million, related to the goodwill at Tropicana Las Vegas and Sanford Orlando Kennel Club.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded other intangible assets impairment charges of $40.0 million, as of the valuation date of October 1, 2015, related to the write-off of our Plainridge Park Casino gaming license and a partial write-down of the gaming license at Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway due to a reduction in the long term earnings forecast at both of these locations.\nConsistent with prior years, we believe at this time all of our reporting units with goodwill and other intangible assets are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges.
