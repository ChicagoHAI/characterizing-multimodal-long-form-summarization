The audited statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are compared in the sections below.\nGeneral Overview\nGBT Technologies Inc. (formerly Gopher Protocol Inc.) (the Company\u201d, GBT\u201d, or GTCH\u201d) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is targeting growing markets such as development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking and tracking technologies, including wireless mesh network technology platform and fixed solutions, development of an intelligent human body vitals device, asset-tracking IoT, and wireless mesh networks, with an AI portfolio. The Company derived revenues from (i) the provision of IT consulting services; and (ii) from the licensing of its technology.\nRecent Developments\nGBT Tokenize Joint Venture\nOn March 6, 2020, the Company through Greenwich, entered into a Joint Venture and Territorial License Agreement (the Tokenize Agreement\u201d) with Tokenize-It, S.A. ( Tokenize\u201d), which is owned by a Costa Rica Trust represented by Pablo Gonzalez ( Gonzalez\u201d). Gonzalez also represents Gonzalez Costa Rica Trust, which holds a note in the principal amount of $10,000,000 and is also a shareholder of the Company. Under the Tokenize Agreement, the parties formed GBT Tokenize Corp., a Nevada corporation ( GBT Tokenize\u201d). The purpose of GBT Tokenize is to develop, maintain and support source codes for its proprietary technologies including advanced mobile chip technologies, tracking, radio technologies, AI core engine, electronic design automation, mesh, games, data storage, networking, IT services, business process outsourcing development services, customer service, technical support and quality assurance for business, customizable and dedicated inbound and outbound calls solutions, as well as digital communications processing for enterprises and startups ( Technology Portfolio\u201d), throughout the State of California. Upon generating any revenue from the Technology Portfolio, the Joint Venture will earn the first right of refusal for other territories. The Company pledged its 50% ownership in GBT Tokenize and its 100% ownership of Greenwich to Tokenize to secure its Technology Portfolio investment. The Company shall appoint two directors and Tokenize shall appoint one director of GBT Tokenize. Tokenize shall contribute the services and resources for the development of the Technology Portfolio to GBT Tokenize. The Company shall contribute 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company ( GBT Shares\u201d) to GBT Tokenize. Tokenize and the Company will each own 50% of GBT Tokenize. The shares were valued at $5,500,000. In addition, GBT Tokenize and Gonzalez entered into a Consulting Agreement in which Gonzalez is engaged to provide services in consideration of $33,333 per month payable quarterly which may be paid in shares of common stock calculated by the amount owed divided by the Company's 10-day VWAP. Gonzalez will provide services in connection with the development of the business as well as GBT Tokenize's capital raising efforts. The term of the Consulting Agreement is two years. During year ended December 31, 2021, Gonzalez assigned all his accrued balances of $424,731 to Stanley Hills in a private transaction that the Company is not part to. The closing of the Tokenize Agreement occurred on March 9, 2020. On May 28, 2021, the parties agreed to amend the Tokenize Agreement to expand territory granted for the Technology Portfolio under the license to GBT Tokenize to include the entire continental United States. The Company has further agreed to issue GBT Tokenize an additional 14,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The shares were valued at $15,400,000. At December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated the carrying amount of this joint venture investment and determined that this investment was fully impaired and as a result an impairment charge of $15,400,000 was taken. Although the investment was impaired, the product development is still ongoing.\nSurge Payment\nOn January 7, 2022, the Company received payments from Surgepays Inc. (formerly known as Surge Holdings, Inc.) in total of $3,750,000 pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement dated December 22, 2021. The $3,750,000 was recorded as other receivable as of December 31, 2021. The entire balance of $3,750,000 was paid in January 2022.\nOn January 28, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Marko Radisic (the Seller\u201d) and Touchpoint pursuant to which the Company acquired 10,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Touchpoint Preferred\u201d) from the Seller in consideration of $125,000. The Touchpoint Preferred is convertible into 10,000,000 shares of common stock of Touchpoint. On or about February 23, 2022 Touchpoint perform automatic conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 10,000,000 shares of common stock of TGHI.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Company, effective March 1, 2022 entered into a Revenue RSA with MAHASER pursuant to which the Company acquired the opportunity to share in revenues generated by MAHASER with respect to e-commerce sales through the world biggest online retail platform in the United States of America. MAHASER owns an e-commerce platform as a store which is the legal, exclusive owner of Ravenholm Electronics. The Company will operate the e-commerce platform and will be entitled to 95% for all revenue generated by and received by MAHASER for the period from March 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The RSA provides that the Company will be entitled to appoint a manager to MAHASER. As consideration, the Company will pay MAHASER $100,000 no later than March 1, 2022 and issue MAHASER 1,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock. The Company shall have no obligations to make any further payments to MAHASER. For any further extensions, the Company will have the option to extend the RSA for annual payment of $200,000, which can be payable with the Company's shares of common stock payable based on 20 days VWAP prior to issuance. On March 16, 2022 the parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the to the RSA, where all consideration to be paid or issued to MAHASER will be deferred until such time where the e-commerce platform generated in cumulative revenue of $1,000,000.\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property License and Royalty Agreement with Touchpoint pursuant to which the Company granted TGHI a worldwide license for its technologies for a term of five years in the domains of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence enabled mobile technologies pertaining to the Company's digital currency technology (the Technology\u201d). GBT will charge TGHI earned royalties based on actual uses by TGHI of the Technology resulting from revenue attributable to the use, performance or other exploitation of the Technology, to the extent applicable, after deducting any taxes that the Company may be required to collect, and deducting any international sales, goods and services, value added taxes or similar taxes which the Company is required to pay, if any, excluding deductions for taxes on the Company net income. TGHI agreed to issue the Company 10,000,000 shares of common stock of TGHI in consideration of the Company entering this Intellectual Property License and Royalty Agreement.\nEquity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021 (the Effective Date\u201d), the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the Equity Financing Agreement\u201d) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with GHS Investments LLC ( GHS\u201d), pursuant to which GHS shall purchase from the Company, up to that number of shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares\u201d) having an aggregate Purchase Price of $10,000,000, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement from time to time over the course of 24 months after an effective registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC (the Contract Period\u201d).\nThe Equity Financing Agreement grants the Company the right, from time to time at its sole discretion (subject to certain conditions) during the Contract Period, to direct GHS to purchase shares of Common Stock on any business day (a Put\u201d), provided that at least ten trading days has passed since the most recent Put. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock contained in a Put will be 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days preceding the receipt by GHS of the applicable Put notice. Such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, may occur from time to time, at the Company's option, during the Contract Period. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement, on each Put the Company will deliver an amount of Shares equaling 110% of the dollar amount of each Put. The maximum dollar amount of each Put will not exceed 200% of the average daily trading dollar volume for the Company's Common Stock during the ten trading days preceding the Trading day that GHS receives a Put. No Put will be made in an amount equaling less than $10,000 or greater than $500,000. Puts are further limited to GHS owning no more than 4.99% of the outstanding stock of the Company at any given time. The Equity Financing Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, obligations, rights, warranties, agreements and conditions of the parties. The Equity Financing Agreement terminates upon any of the following events: when GHS has purchased an aggregate of $10,000,000 in the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement; on the date that is 24 calendar months from the date the Equity Financing Agreement was executed.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to GHS under the Equity Financing Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The Company issued 463,303 shares with net proceeds of $66,942 from the Equity Financing Agreement in February 2022.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company operates in a high-tech marketplace and relies on professionals and partnerships all over the world, which is impacted by the global pandemic, causing the Company's resources to be affected. Our business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus disease COVID-19.\nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, PRC, in late 2019 and has been expanding globally. COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat.\nOn March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California was therefore under strict quarantine control and travel has been severely restricted, resulting in disruptions to work, communications, and access to files (due to limited access to facilities). Since then, other measures have been imposed in other countries and major cities in the USA, including Los Angeles, and throughout the world in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The World Health Organization (the WHO\u201d) is closely monitoring and evaluating the situation. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, expanding its assessment of the threat beyond the global health emergency it had announced in January. Any outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments in the USA or elsewhere in the world may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business. The stay-at-home order was lifted in California only on January 25, 2021.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in our development operations, which have resulted in delays on exiting projects. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the development, delivery and assembly process within any of our activities could continue to result in, increased costs and reduced revenue.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers and vendors or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations:\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA comparison of the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales - related party </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,655,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,952,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,702,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134.58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,475,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,772,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,702,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137.69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,454,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,206,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,248,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,979,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,950,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from continued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,979,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,950,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984,787 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>984,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,994,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,510,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $180,000. Sales are derived from providing IT consulting services to a related party.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $18,655,514, compared to $7,952,836 for the same period in 2020. The increase of $10,702,678 or 134.58% was principally due to increase in the impairment of GBT Tokenize Joint Venture investment of $9,800,000, increase in marketing expenses of $526,774, increase in general and administrative expenses of $104,963, and increase in professional expenses of $270,94 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $15,454,919, an increase of $4,248,080 or 37.91% from $4,248,080 for the same period in 2020. The increase is principally due to an increase on debt modification of $13,777,480; and offset by i) an increase in realized other income of $2,497,500; ii) reduction of amortization of debt discounts by $3,373,312; iii) reduction of change in fair value of derivative liability by $194,493; iv) reduction in interest expense and financing costs of $927,265; v) reduction in unrealized loss on marketable equity security of $671,000; and vi) reduction in realized loss on disposal of marketable equity security by $435,830.\nThe operating results for UGO have been presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as discontinued operations and are summarized below:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,291,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,900,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,924 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,924 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the disposition of Ugopherservices, ECS Prepaid, Electronic Check Services and the Central State Legal Services businesses, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of $1,001,711 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33,930,433 compared to $17,994,888 for the same period in 2020 due to the factors described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 and has a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 as of December 31, 2021, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through some private placement offerings of debt and equity securities. These plans, if successful, will mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.\nOur cash was $155,106 and $113,034 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,369,114, compared to $994,426 during the same period in 2020. The amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2021 was primarily related to a net loss of $33,930,433 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $824,238, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $136,785, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,339,117, shares issued for services of 281,748, loss on modification of debt of $13,777,480, impairment of assets of $15,400,000, and net working capital increase of $1,612,950. Our working capital position changed by going from a working capital deficit of $27,710,040 at December 31, 2020 to a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 at December 31, 2021.\nThe amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2020 was primarily related to a net loss of $17,994,888 and gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $1001,711 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $4,197,550, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $1,343,847, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,553,610, loss on modification of debt of $242,712, impairment of assets of $5,600,000, unrealized loss on market equity security of $621,000, realized gain on disposal of market equity security of $474,830, loss on exchange of asset of $1,430,000, and convertible note receivable exchanged for services of $200,000, and net working capital increase of $2,312,261.\nCash flows used in investing activities were $231,771 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0 for the same period in 2021. The decrease is due to the amount of cash of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,279,597, compared to $1,411,186 for the same period in 2021. The increase is due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,517,386 and offset by repayment of convertible notes of $106,200. Cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,279,597.\nWe sustained net losses of $33,930,433 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 and accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 at December 31, 2021.\nEquity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021 (the Effective Date\u201d), the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the Equity Financing Agreement\u201d) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with GHS Investments LLC ( GHS\u201d), pursuant to which GHS shall purchase from the Company, up to that number of shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares\u201d) having an aggregate Purchase Price of $10,000,000, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement from time to time over the course of 24 months after an effective registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC (the Contract Period\u201d).\nThe Equity Financing Agreement grants the Company the right, from time to time at its sole discretion (subject to certain conditions) during the Contract Period, to direct GHS to purchase shares of Common Stock on any business day (a Put\u201d), provided that at least ten trading days has passed since the most recent Put. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock contained in a Put will be 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days preceding the receipt by GHS of the applicable Put notice. Such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, may occur from time to time, at the Company's option, during the Contract Period. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement, on each Put the Company will deliver an amount of Shares equaling 110% of the dollar amount of each Put. The maximum dollar amount of each Put will not exceed 200% of the average daily trading dollar volume for the Company's Common Stock during the ten trading days preceding the Trading day that GHS receives a Put. No Put will be made in an amount equaling less than $10,000 or greater than $500,000. Puts are further limited to GHS owning no more than 4.99% of the outstanding stock of the Company at any given time. The Equity Financing Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, obligations, rights, warranties, agreements and conditions of the parties. The Equity Financing Agreement terminates upon any of the following events: when GHS has purchased an aggregate of $10,000,000 in the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement; on the date that is 24 calendar months from the date the Equity Financing Agreement was executed.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to GHS under the Equity Financing Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations.\nIn September of 2017 we purchased the assets of RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, and then after ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. in 2018. RWJ and ECS have historically generated significant revenues which we do not expect to continue in the future, as the Company divested its investment in ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. on or around September 2019, left only with the acquired assets from RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC which on September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mr. LightHouse LTD., an Israeli corporation ( MLH\u201d) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and assign to MLH, effective July 1, 2020 all the shares, and certain specified liabilities, of Ugopherservices Corp., in consideration of $100,000 to be paid through the delivery of a promissory note payable to the Company (the Note\u201d), as disclosed in this report. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and we will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Further, we need additional capital to continue operations. Accordingly, we engaged GHS in equity financings to secure additional funds, as disclosed in this report. We expect that we have sufficient capital to maintain operations through the end of 2022. In order to fully implement our business plan, we will need to raise $10,000,000.

The Market Price is the average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices during the period the Debenture is outstanding. On May 28, 2019, the Investor delivered to the Company a Notice of Default and Notice of Sale of Collateral\u201d (the Notice\u201d). On December 23, 2019, in arbitration between the Company and the Investor, an Interim Award was entered in favor of the Investor. On January 31, 2020, the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the Final Award\u201d). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Debenture constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that the Investor was entitled to recovery of their attorney's fees. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded Investor an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 and costs in the amount of $55,613. On February 18, 2020, the Company filed a motion with the United States District Court District of Nevada (the Nevada Court\u201d) to confirm the Final Award and a motion to consolidate Investor's application to confirm the Final Award filed in the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM) (the Virgin Island Court\u201d). On February 27, 2020, the Nevada Court denied the Company's motion to confirm the Final Award and motion to consolidate and further decided that the confirmation of the Final Award should be litigated in the Virgin Island Court. As such, on February 27, 2020, the Company filed a Notice of Entry of Order as well as a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award, address the outstanding issues regarding whether Investor's rights are subordinated to other creditors and, thereafter, oversee a commercially reasonable foreclosure sale (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM). It was the Company's position that the Final Award must first be confirmed and all questions regarding the rights of Investor relative to those of other creditors must be determined before any foreclosure sale can proceed. It is further the position of the Company that the previously disclosed foreclosure sale scheduled by Investor is being conducted in a commercially unreasonable manner and that if Discover proceeded forward with the foreclosure sale it did so at its own risk. Nevertheless, on February 28, 2020, Investor advised that it conducted a sale of the Company's assets. As the date of this report Investor failed to present a deed of sale for the alleged sale that allegedly took place as noticed. The Company filed with Virgin Island Court the motions disputing the validity of the alleged sale. On July 28, 2020, Investor filed in the State of Nevada a motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716. The Company filed an answer on August 11, 2020. On October 16, 2020, Investor motion was denied. This case is still pending with the Federal court and the Court has not taken any substantive action in the matter as of the date of this report.\nPower Up Lending Group\nOn February 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Power Up Lending Group Ltd., an accredited investor ( Power Up\u201d) pursuant to which the Company issued to Power Up a Convertible Promissory Note (the Power Note\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $183,600 for a purchase price of $153,000.

Also, on June 24, 2021, the Company transferred 5,500,000 SURG shares received as repayment of $660,000 of this convertible note (See Note 4).\nAs of December 31, 2021, the note had an outstanding balance of $8,055,400 and accrued interest of $1,545,721.\nSixth Street Lending LLC\nOn November 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Sixth Street Lending LLC ( Sixth Street\u201d) pursuant to which the Company issued to Sixth Street a Convertible Promissory Note (the Sixth Street Note\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $124,200 for a purchase price of $103,500. The Sixth Street Note has a maturity date of February 8, 2023 and the Company has agreed to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of the note at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date on which the note is issued (the Issue Date\u201d) until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. The Company shall have the right to prepay the note, provided it makes a payment including a prepayment to Sixth Street as set forth in the Sixth Street Note. The outstanding principal amount of the note may not be converted prior to the period beginning on the date that is 180 days following the Issue Date. Following the 180th day, Sixth Street may convert the note into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average of the two lowest trading prices with a 20-day look back immediately preceding the date of conversion. Since the conversion price will vary based on the Company's stock price, the beneficial conversion feature associated with this note is accounted for as a derivative liability. In addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default (as defined in the Sixth Street Note), the note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company shall pay to Sixth Street, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, additional amounts as set forth in the Sixth Street Note. As of December 31, 2021, the note had an outstanding balance of $124,200 and accrued interest of $1,061.\nStanley Hills LLC Convertible Note Payable\nThe Company entered into a series of loan agreements with Stanley Hills LLC ( Stanley\u201d) pursuant to which it received more than $1,000,000 in loans (the Debt\u201d) since May 2019 up to December 2019. On February 26, 2020, in order to induce Stanley to continue to provide funding, the Company and Stanley entered into a letter agreement providing that the current note payable balance due to Stanley in the amount of $1,214,900 may be converted into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 85% multiplied by the lowest one trading price for the common stock during the 20-trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date. Since the conversion price will vary based on the Company's stock price, the beneficial conversion feature associated with this note is accounted for as a derivative liability. Stanley has agreed to restrict its ability to convert the Debt and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by it and its affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Stanley converted $1,231,466 of its convertible note plus interest into 4,420,758 shares of the Company's common stock, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, Stanley loaned the Company an additional $325,000. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company transferred the SURG shares received as repayment of $800,000 of this convertible note (See Note 4) and converted $126,003 of accrued interest into the principal balance. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Gonzalez assigned all his accrued balances of $424,731 to Stanley in a private transaction that the Company is not part to (See Note 5). The balance of the Stanley convertible note payable at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $116,605 and $1,009,469, respectively. The Stanley debt is secured via a pledge agreement on the SURG shares.\nStanley Hills LLC Accounts Payable\nOn January 1, 2021, SURG, AltCorp and Stanley entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement ( Settlement Agreement\u201d) after Stanley sued SURG. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, SURG agreed to amend the AltCorp Exchange Agreement where SURG acknowledged a debt of $3,300,000 (the Debt\u201d) to be paid in 33 monthly payments of $100,000 payable in shares of common stock of SURG at a per share price equal the volume weighted average price of Surg's common stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the issuance. The Company paid $650,000 in cash and the remaining by shares. The SURG common stock issued to Altcorp have been pledged since August 12, 2020 for the benefit of Stanley to secure Stanley's note payable by the Company. Accordingly, the SURG Common Stock issued to AltCorp as a result of the Settlement Agreement were pledged to Stanley.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded an outstanding payable balance to Stanley amounted $1,862,928.\nSales for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $180,000. Sales are derived from providing IT consulting services to Stanley.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts and classification of revenues and expenses during the periods presented, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and material changes in these estimates or assumptions could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded on the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily-apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations, and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. An accounting is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, and if different estimates that could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our financial statements. Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also critical to understanding our financial statements. The notes to our financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d).\nStock Split\nOn October 26, 2021, the Company effectuated a 1 for 50 reverse stock split. The share and per share information has been retroactively restated to reflect this reverse stock split.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nThe Company accounts for marketable equity securities in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Investments - equity securities. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on quotations available on securities exchanges with any unrealized gain or loss being reported as a component of other income (expense) on the statement of operations. The portion of marketable equity security expected to be sold within twelve months of the balance sheet date is reported as a current asset.\nRevenue Recognition\nAccounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company's revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the modified retrospective\u201d transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. The Company had no significant post-delivery obligations, this new standard did not result in a material recognition of revenue on the Company's accompanying consolidated financial statements for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously-reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nRevenue is recognized under Topic 606 as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>executed contracts with the Company's customers that it believes are legally enforceable; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>identification of performance obligations in the respective contract; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>allocation the transaction price to each performance obligation; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese five elements, as applied to each of the Company's revenue category, is summarized below:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>IT consulting services - revenue is recorded on a monthly basis as services are provided; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>License fees and Royalties - revenue is recognized based on the terms of the agreement with its customer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnearned revenue\nUnearned revenue represents the net amount received for the purchase of products that have not seen shipped to the Company's customers.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's only derivative financial instrument was an embedded conversion feature associated with convertible notes payable due to certain provisions that allow for a change in the conversion price based on a percentage of the Company's stock price at the date of conversion.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology us one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the fair value measurement. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nFor certain financial instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and current liabilities, including convertible notes payable, each qualify as a financial instrument, and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest.\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company's derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nUnder ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not\u201d test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.\nDividends\nThe Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No cash dividends have been paid or declared since the Date of Inception.", "summary": "The MD&A section of the report discusses the company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Equity Financing Agreement terminates upon any of the following events: when GHS has purchased an aggregate of $10,000,000 in the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement; on the date that is 24 calendar months from the date the Equity Financing Agreement was executed.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to GHS under the Equity Financing Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The Company issued 463,303 shares with net proceeds of $66,942 from the Equity Financing Agreement in February 2022.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company operates in a high-tech marketplace and relies on professionals and partnerships all over the world, which is impacted by the global pandemic, causing the Company's resources to be affected. Our business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus disease COVID-19.\nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, PRC, in late 2019 and has been expanding globally. COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat.\nOn March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California was therefore under strict quarantine control and travel has been severely restricted, resulting in disruptions to work, communications, and access to files (due to limited access to facilities). Since then, other measures have been imposed in other countries and major cities in the USA, including Los Angeles, and throughout the world in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The World Health Organization (the WHO\u201d) is closely monitoring and evaluating the situation. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, expanding its assessment of the threat beyond the global health emergency it had announced in January. Any outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments in the USA or elsewhere in the world may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business. The stay-at-home order was lifted in California only on January 25, 2021.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in our development operations, which have resulted in delays on exiting projects. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the development, delivery and assembly process within any of our activities could continue to result in, increased costs and reduced revenue.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers and vendors or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations:\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA comparison of the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n\nSales for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $180,000. Sales are derived from providing IT consulting services to a related party.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $18,655,514, compared to $7,952,836 for the same period in 2020. The increase of $10,702,678 or 134.58% was principally due to increase in the impairment of GBT Tokenize Joint Venture investment of $9,800,000, increase in marketing expenses of $526,774, increase in general and administrative expenses of $104,963, and increase in professional expenses of $270,94 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $15,454,919, an increase of $4,248,080 or 37.91% from $4,248,080 for the same period in 2020. The increase is principally due to an increase on debt modification of $13,777,480; and offset by i) an increase in realized other income of $2,497,500; ii) reduction of amortization of debt discounts by $3,373,312; iii) reduction of change in fair value of derivative liability by $194,493; iv) reduction in interest expense and financing costs of $927,265; v) reduction in unrealized loss on marketable equity security of $671,000; and vi) reduction in realized loss on disposal of marketable equity security by $435,830.\nThe operating results for UGO have been presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as discontinued operations and are summarized below:\n\nAs a result of the disposition of Ugopherservices, ECS Prepaid, Electronic Check Services and the Central State Legal Services businesses, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of $1,001,711 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33,930,433 compared to $17,994,888 for the same period in 2020 due to the factors described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 and has a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 as of December 31, 2021, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through some private placement offerings of debt and equity securities. These plans, if successful, will mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.\nOur cash was $155,106 and $113,034 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,369,114, compared to $994,426 during the same period in 2020. The amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2021 was primarily related to a net loss of $33,930,433 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $824,238, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $136,785, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,339,117, shares issued for services of 281,748, loss on modification of debt of $13,777,480, impairment of assets of $15,400,000, and net working capital increase of $1,612,950. Our working capital position changed by going from a working capital deficit of $27,710,040 at December 31, 2020 to a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 at December 31, 2021.\nThe amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2020 was primarily related to a net loss of $17,994,888 and gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $1001,711 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $4,197,550, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $1,343,847, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,553,610, loss on modification of debt of $242,712, impairment of assets of $5,600,000, unrealized loss on market equity security of $621,000, realized gain on disposal of market equity security of $474,830, loss on exchange of asset of $1,430,000, and convertible note receivable exchanged for services of $200,000, and net working capital increase of $2,312,261.\nCash flows used in investing activities were $231,771 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0 for the same period in 2021. The decrease is due to the amount of cash of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,279,597, compared to $1,411,186 for the same period in 2021. The increase is due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,517,386 and offset by repayment of convertible notes of $106,200. Cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,279,597.\nWe sustained net losses of $33,930,433 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 and accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 at December 31, 2021.\nEquity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021 (the Effective Date\u201d), the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the Equity Financing Agreement\u201d) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with GHS Investments LLC ( GHS\u201d), pursuant to which GHS shall purchase from the Company, up to that number of shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares\u201d) having an aggregate Purchase Price of $10,000,000, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement from time to time over the course of 24 months after an effective registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC (the Contract Period\u201d).\nThe Equity Financing Agreement grants the Company the right, from time to time at its sole discretion (subject to certain conditions) during the Contract Period, to direct GHS to purchase shares of Common Stock on any business day (a Put\u201d), provided that at least ten trading days has passed since the most recent Put. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock contained in a Put will be 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days preceding the receipt by GHS of the applicable Put notice. Such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, may occur from time to time, at the Company's option, during the Contract Period. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement, on each Put the Company will deliver an amount of Shares equaling 110% of the dollar amount of each Put. The maximum dollar amount of each Put will not exceed 200% of the average daily trading dollar volume for the Company's Common Stock during the ten trading days preceding the Trading day that GHS receives a Put. No Put will be made in an amount equaling less than $10,000 or greater than $500,000. Puts are further limited to GHS owning no more than 4.99% of the outstanding stock of the Company at any given time. The Equity Financing Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, obligations, rights, warranties, agreements and conditions of the parties. The Equity Financing Agreement terminates upon any of the following events: when GHS has purchased an aggregate of $10,000,000 in the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement; on the date that is 24 calendar months from the date the Equity Financing Agreement was executed.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to GHS under the Equity Financing Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations.\nIn September of 2017 we purchased the assets of RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, and then after ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. in 2018. RWJ and ECS have historically generated significant revenues which we do not expect to continue in the future, as the Company divested its investment in ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. on or around September 2019, left only with the acquired assets from RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC which on September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mr. LightHouse LTD., an Israeli corporation ( MLH\u201d) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and assign to MLH, effective July 1, 2020 all the shares, and certain specified liabilities, of Ugopherservices Corp., in consideration of $100,000 to be paid through the delivery of a promissory note payable to the Company (the Note\u201d), as disclosed in this report. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and we will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Further, we need additional capital to continue operations. Accordingly, we engaged GHS in equity financings to secure additional funds, as disclosed in this report. We expect that we have sufficient capital to maintain operations through the end of 2022. In order to fully implement our business plan, we will need to raise $10,000,000. The Company will need to raise additional capital in the future of which there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to successfully raise such capital on acceptable terms. With the current cash on hand, cash in our attorney's trust account and additional cash anticipated to be raised in the future, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our obligations for the next 12 months. The Company issued 463,303 shares with net proceeds of $66,942 from the Equity Financing Agreement in February 2022.\n$10,000,000 for GBT Technologies S.

The Company issued 463,303 shares with net proceeds of $66,942 from the Equity Financing Agreement in February 2022.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company operates in a high-tech marketplace and relies on professionals and partnerships all over the world, which is impacted by the global pandemic, causing the Company's resources to be affected. Our business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus disease COVID-19.\nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, PRC, in late 2019 and has been expanding globally. COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat.\nOn March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California was therefore under strict quarantine control and travel has been severely restricted, resulting in disruptions to work, communications, and access to files (due to limited access to facilities). Since then, other measures have been imposed in other countries and major cities in the USA, including Los Angeles, and throughout the world in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The World Health Organization (the WHO\u201d) is closely monitoring and evaluating the situation. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, expanding its assessment of the threat beyond the global health emergency it had announced in January. Any outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments in the USA or elsewhere in the world may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business. The stay-at-home order was lifted in California only on January 25, 2021.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in our development operations, which have resulted in delays on exiting projects. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the development, delivery and assembly process within any of our activities could continue to result in, increased costs and reduced revenue.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers and vendors or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations:\nYears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA comparison of the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales - related party </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,655,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,952,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,702,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134.58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,475,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,772,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,702,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137.69 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,454,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,206,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,248,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,979,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,950,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from continued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,979,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,950,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984,787 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>984,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,930,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,994,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,510,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $180,000. Sales are derived from providing IT consulting services to a related party.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $18,655,514, compared to $7,952,836 for the same period in 2020. The increase of $10,702,678 or 134.58% was principally due to increase in the impairment of GBT Tokenize Joint Venture investment of $9,800,000, increase in marketing expenses of $526,774, increase in general and administrative expenses of $104,963, and increase in professional expenses of $270,94 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $15,454,919, an increase of $4,248,080 or 37.91% from $4,248,080 for the same period in 2020. The increase is principally due to an increase on debt modification of $13,777,480; and offset by i) an increase in realized other income of $2,497,500; ii) reduction of amortization of debt discounts by $3,373,312; iii) reduction of change in fair value of derivative liability by $194,493; iv) reduction in interest expense and financing costs of $927,265; v) reduction in unrealized loss on marketable equity security of $671,000; and vi) reduction in realized loss on disposal of marketable equity security by $435,830.\nThe operating results for UGO have been presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as discontinued operations and are summarized below:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,291,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,900,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,924 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,924 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the disposition of Ugopherservices, ECS Prepaid, Electronic Check Services and the Central State Legal Services businesses, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of $1,001,711 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33,930,433 compared to $17,994,888 for the same period in 2020 due to the factors described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 and has a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 as of December 31, 2021, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through some private placement offerings of debt and equity securities. These plans, if successful, will mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.\nOur cash was $155,106 and $113,034 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,369,114, compared to $994,426 during the same period in 2020. The amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2021 was primarily related to a net loss of $33,930,433 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $824,238, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $136,785, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,339,117, shares issued for services of 281,748, loss on modification of debt of $13,777,480, impairment of assets of $15,400,000, and net working capital increase of $1,612,950. Our working capital position changed by going from a working capital deficit of $27,710,040 at December 31, 2020 to a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 at December 31, 2021.\nThe amount used in operating activities for the year ended December 31 2020 was primarily related to a net loss of $17,994,888 and gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $1001,711 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $4,197,550, excess of debt discount and financing costs of $1,343,847, change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,553,610, loss on modification of debt of $242,712, impairment of assets of $5,600,000, unrealized loss on market equity security of $621,000, realized gain on disposal of market equity security of $474,830, loss on exchange of asset of $1,430,000, and convertible note receivable exchanged for services of $200,000, and net working capital increase of $2,312,261.\nCash flows used in investing activities were $231,771 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0 for the same period in 2021. The decrease is due to the amount of cash of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,279,597, compared to $1,411,186 for the same period in 2021. The increase is due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,517,386 and offset by repayment of convertible notes of $106,200. Cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the issuance of convertible notes and notes payable in 2021 of $1,279,597.\nWe sustained net losses of $33,930,433 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $28,388,580 and accumulated deficit of $304,581,773 at December 31, 2021.\nEquity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021 (the Effective Date\u201d), the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the Equity Financing Agreement\u201d) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with GHS Investments LLC ( GHS\u201d), pursuant to which GHS shall purchase from the Company, up to that number of shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares\u201d) having an aggregate Purchase Price of $10,000,000, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement from time to time over the course of 24 months after an effective registration of the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC (the Contract Period\u201d).\nThe Equity Financing Agreement grants the Company the right, from time to time at its sole discretion (subject to certain conditions) during the Contract Period, to direct GHS to purchase shares of Common Stock on any business day (a Put\u201d), provided that at least ten trading days has passed since the most recent Put. The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock contained in a Put will be 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days preceding the receipt by GHS of the applicable Put notice. Such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, may occur from time to time, at the Company's option, during the Contract Period. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Agreement, on each Put the Company will deliver an amount of Shares equaling 110% of the dollar amount of each Put. The maximum dollar amount of each Put will not exceed 200% of the average daily trading dollar volume for the Company's Common Stock during the ten trading days preceding the Trading day that GHS receives a Put. No Put will be made in an amount equaling less than $10,000 or greater than $500,000. Puts are further limited to GHS owning no more than 4.99% of the outstanding stock of the Company at any given time. The Equity Financing Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, obligations, rights, warranties, agreements and conditions of the parties. The Equity Financing Agreement terminates upon any of the following events: when GHS has purchased an aggregate of $10,000,000 in the Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement; on the date that is 24 calendar months from the date the Equity Financing Agreement was executed.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to GHS under the Equity Financing Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations.\nIn September of 2017 we purchased the assets of RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, and then after ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. in 2018. RWJ and ECS have historically generated significant revenues which we do not expect to continue in the future, as the Company divested its investment in ECS Prepaid LLC, Electronic Check Services, Inc. and Central States Legal Services, Inc. on or around September 2019, left only with the acquired assets from RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC which on September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mr. LightHouse LTD., an Israeli corporation ( MLH\u201d) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and assign to MLH, effective July 1, 2020 all the shares, and certain specified liabilities, of Ugopherservices Corp., in consideration of $100,000 to be paid through the delivery of a promissory note payable to the Company (the Note\u201d), as disclosed in this report. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and we will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Further, we need additional capital to continue operations. Accordingly, we engaged GHS in equity financings to secure additional funds, as disclosed in this report. We expect that we have sufficient capital to maintain operations through the end of 2022. In order to fully implement our business plan, we will need to raise $10,000,000. The Company will need to raise additional capital in the future of which there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to successfully raise such capital on acceptable terms. With the current cash on hand, cash in our attorney's trust account and additional cash anticipated to be raised in the future, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our obligations for the next 12 months. The Company issued 463,303 shares with net proceeds of $66,942 from the Equity Financing Agreement in February 2022.\n$10,000,000 for GBT Technologies S. A. acquisition (assigned to a third-party Igor 1 Corp)\nIn accordance with the acquisition of GBT-CR the Company issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $10,000,000. The convertible note bears interest of 6% per annum and is payable at maturity on December 31, 2021. At the election of the holder, the convertible note can be converted into a maximum of 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder but subject to the Company increasing its authorized shares of common stock, into such number of shares of common stock of the Company as determined by dividing the Stated Value ($500 per share) by the conversion price ($10.00 per share). On May 19, 2021, the Company, IGOR 1 Corp, , and Gonzalez GBTCR (none related parties)entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement and Irrevocable Assignment of Note Balance Principal and Accrued Interest (the Gonzalez Agreement\u201d).
