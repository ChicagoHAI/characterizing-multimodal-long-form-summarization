Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d will,\u201d and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances, or for any other reason.\nOVERVIEW\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Horizon Pharma plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, including its predecessor, Horizon Pharma, Inc., or HPI. All references to Vidara\u201d are references to Horizon Pharma plc (formerly known as Vidara Therapeutics International Public Limited Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger of the businesses of HPI and Vidara on September 19, 2014, or the Vidara Merger. The disclosures in this report relating to the pre-Vidara Merger business of Horizon Pharma plc, unless noted as being the business of Vidara prior to the Vidara Merger, pertain to the business of HPI prior to the Vidara Merger.\nOur Business\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients' lives by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs. We market eleven medicines through our orphan, rheumatology and primary care business units. Our marketed medicines are ACTIMMUNE\u00ae (interferon gamma-1b), BUPHENYL\u00ae (sodium phenylbutyrate) Tablets and Powder, DUEXIS\u00ae (ibuprofen/famotidine), KRYSTEXXA\u00ae (pegloticase), MIGERGOT\u00ae (ergotamine tartrate & caffeine suppositories), PENNSAID\u00ae (diclofenac sodium topical solution) 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, PROCYSBI\u00ae (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules, QUINSAIR\u2122 (aerosolized form of levofloxacin), RAVICTI\u00ae (glycerol phenylbutyrate) Oral Liquid, RAYOS\u00ae (prednisone) delayed-release tablets and VIMOVO\u00ae (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium).\nWe developed DUEXIS and RAYOS, known as LODOTRA\u00ae outside the United States, acquired the U.S. rights to VIMOVO from AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, in November 2013, acquired certain rights to ACTIMMUNE as a result of the Vidara Merger in September 2014, acquired the U.S. rights to PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo Research Inc., or Nuvo, in October 2014, acquired RAVICTI and BUPHENYL, known as AMMONAPS\u00ae in certain European countries, as a result of our acquisition of Hyperion Therapeutics Inc., or Hyperion, in May 2015, acquired KRYSTEXXA and the U.S. rights to MIGERGOT as a result of our acquisition of Crealta Holdings LLC., or Crealta, in January 2016 and acquired PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR as a result of our acquisition of Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp., or Raptor, in October 2016.\nOn January 13, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Crealta for approximately $539.7 million, including cash acquired of $24.9 million. Following completion of the acquisition, Crealta became our wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed Horizon Pharma Rheumatology LLC.\nOn May 18, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim International, to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, which Boehringer Ingelheim International currently commercializes under the trade names IMUKIN\u00ae, IMUKINE\u00ae, IMMUKIN\u00ae and IMMUKINE\u00ae in an estimated thirty countries primarily in Europe and the Middle East. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Boehringer Ingelheim International \u20ac5.0 million ($5.6 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of payment of 1.1132) upon signing and will pay \u20ac20.0 million upon closing, for certain rights for interferon gamma-1b in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan, as we currently hold marketing rights to interferon gamma-1b in these territories. We currently market interferon gamma-1b as ACTIMMUNE in the United States. The transaction is expected to close in 2017 and we are continuing to work with Boehringer Ingelheim International to enable the transfer of applicable marketing authorizations. We recorded an impairment charge of \u20ac5.0 million ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052) during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the initial payment on our consolidated balance sheet, and upon closing we expect to record the additional \u20ac20.0 million payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income. See Results from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\u201d section below for further details.\nOn October 25, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Raptor in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Raptor's common stock for $9.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $860.8 million, including cash acquired of $24.9 million and $56.0 million to repay Raptor's outstanding debt. Following completion of the acquisition, Raptor became our wholly owned subsidiary and converted to a limited liability company, changing its name to Horizon Pharmaceutical LLC. We financed the transaction through $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans pursuant to an amendment to our existing credit agreement and cash on hand.\nPart of our commercial strategy for RAYOS and our primary care medicines is to offer physicians the opportunity to have their patients fill prescriptions through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient access program. For commercial patients who are prescribed our primary care medicines or RAYOS, the HorizonCares program offers co-pay assistance when a third-party commercial payer covers a prescription but requires an eligible patient to pay a co-pay or deductible, and offers full subsidization when a third-party commercial payer rejects coverage for an eligible patient. During 2016, we entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our medicines, such as our arrangements with Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Prime Therapeutics LLC. While we believe that this strategy will result in broader inclusion of certain of our primary care medicines on healthcare plan formularies, and therefore increase payer reimbursement and lower our cost of providing patient access programs, these arrangements generally require us to pay administrative and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payers.\nWe market our medicines in the United States through our field sales force, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2016. Our strategy is to continue to build a well-balanced, diversified, high-growth biopharmaceutical company. We are executing this through the successful commercialization of our existing medicines, a strong commitment to patient access and support and business development efforts focused on transformative acquisitions to accelerate our rare disease leadership as well as on-market and development-stage medicines to fill out our pipeline.\nWe are building a sustainable biopharmaceutical company by helping ensure that patients have access to their medicines and support services, and by investing in the further development of medicines for patients with rare or underserved diseases. Our growing business is diversified across three business units: orphan, rheumatology and primary care, and is driven by a successful commercial model that focuses on differentiated, long-life medicines, innovative patient access programs and a disciplined business development strategy.\nResults from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\nOn December 8, 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 trial, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study, or STEADFAST, evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, or FA, did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline in the modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale, or FARS-mNeuro, at twenty-six weeks versus treatment with placebo and that the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance, or the FA announcement. No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved indications. We, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, or FARA, Collaborative Clinical Research Network in FA, determined that, based on the trial results, the STEADFAST program would be discontinued, including the twenty-six week extension study and the long-term safety study.\nFollowing the FA announcement, we recorded the following amounts in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Financial Statement Line Item\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss/(Gain)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Note\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment of in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of non-current asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,480\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical trial wind-down costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote 1 In-process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the research and development project to evaluate ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA, which we acquired in the Vidara Merger. At the time of the Vidara Merger, IPR&D was considered separable from the business as the project could be sold to a third party, and we assigned a fair value of $66.0 million to the intangible asset using an income approach in our purchase accounting. Following the FA announcement, we determined that the IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 2 As described above, on May 18, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, and we paid Boehringer Ingelheim International \u20ac5.0 million upon signing. The purchase price was determined with the expectation that the STEADFAST study would be successful. Following the FA announcement, we determined that this payment, which was recorded in other assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet was impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052). Upon closing, we will pay Boehringer Ingelheim International an additional \u20ac20.0 million and we expect to record this payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNote 3 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we committed to purchase additional units of ACTIMMUNE from Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional units of ACTIMMUNE were intended to cover anticipated demand if the results of the STEADFAST study of ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA had been successful. Following the FA announcement, we recorded a loss of $14.3 million for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our current forecasts for future demand. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also committed to incur an additional $14.9 million for the harmonization of the drug substance manufacturing process with Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional costs have not been included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss or our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.\nNote 4 At the time of the Vidara Merger, we assigned a fair value to a contingent liability for royalties potentially payable under previously existing royalty and licensing agreements related to ACTIMMUNE, which included an amount of $2.5 million for estimated future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA. Following the FA announcement, we recorded an adjustment to reduce the contingent royalty liability for ACTIMMUNE by $2.5 million as we do not anticipate future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA.\nNote 5 Following the FA announcement, we recorded an amount of $4.0 million at December 31, 2016 related to costs anticipated to be incurred to discontinue the STEADFAST study. These costs will be incurred without economic benefit to us, and represent costs to us to wind down the study under U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, protocol.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the growth in net sales of PENNSAID 2%, the full-period recognition of RAVICTI sales in 2016, compared to a partial period recognition in 2015 following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, the recognition of KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016 and the recognition of PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016, offset by the $65.0 million litigation settlement with Express Scripts along with lower net sales of VIMOVO and DUEXIS.\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales increased $157.4 million, or 107%, to $304.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $147.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $87.5 million due to higher net pricing and $69.9 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nDUEXIS. Net sales decreased $16.6 million, or 9%, to $173.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $190.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $50.4 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance, offset by an increase of approximately $33.8 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nRAVICTI. Net sales increased $64.7 million, or 74%, to $151.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $86.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $55.7 million resulting from prescription volume growth and $9.0 million due to higher net pricing. We began recognizing RAVICTI sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of RAVICTI sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nVIMOVO. Net sales decreased $45.4 million, or 27%, to $121.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $166.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $35.9 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance and approximately $9.5 million resulting from lower prescription volumes.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales decreased $2.8 million, or 3%, to $104.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $107.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $8.8 million resulting from prescription volume decreases, offset by an increase of approximately $6.0 million due to higher net pricing.\nKRYSTEXXA. Net sales were $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $7.0 million, or 17%, to $47.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $40.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $8.4 million resulting from prescription volume growth, offset by a decrease of approximately $1.4 million due to lower net pricing.\nPROCYSBI. Net sales were $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales increased $3.4 million, or 25%, to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing BUPHENYL sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of BUPHENYL sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMIGERGOT. Net sales were $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing MIGERGOT sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nLODOTRA. Net sales decreased $0.7 million, or 14%, to $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to fewer shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occur at the time we ship, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales are not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and can therefore fluctuate significantly.\nQUINSAIR. Net sales were $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing QUINSAIR sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Express Scripts pursuant to which we and Express Scripts were released from any and all claims relating to our then ongoing litigation without admitting any fault or wrongdoing and we agreed to pay Express Scripts $65.0 million. This settlement has been accounted for as a reduction of net sales\u201d in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe table below reconciles our gross sales to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,234.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,057.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to gross sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prompt pay discounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicine returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Co-pay and other patient assistance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,701.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,020.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesaler fees and commercial rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (133.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government rebates and chargebacks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (272.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,253.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,300.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 981.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, co-pay and other patient assistance, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 52.6% from 49.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our HorizonCares program during 2016.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patient deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased $173.8 million to $393.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $219.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 40.0% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 29.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The large increase in costs of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due to the one-time reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the litigation settlement with Express Scripts and an increase in cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of higher intangible amortization expense of $84.0 million and increased inventory step-up expense of $59.6 million. Other factors that caused cost of goods sold to increase during the year included a $14.3 million expense related to a loss on inventory purchase commitments, higher royalty accretion expense of $20.5 million and a $16.2 million increase in direct and indirect costs associated with higher sales, offset by a $20.8 million decrease in charges relating to the remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities.\nThe increase in intangible amortization of $84.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to a $33.9 million increase in amortization expense related to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL intangible assets (acquired in May 2015), $35.9 million amortization of developed technology related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT (acquired in January 2016), $14.0 million amortization of developed technology related to PROCYSBI (acquired in October 2016) and $0.2 million increase in amortization related to ACTIMMUNE.\nBecause inventory step-up expense is acquisition-related, will not continue indefinitely and has a significant effect on our gross profit, gross margin percentage and net income (loss) for all affected periods, we disclose balance sheet and income statement amounts related to inventory step-up within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in inventory step-up expense of $59.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to $48.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory step-up (acquired in January 2016) and $22.4 million related to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory step-up (acquired in October 2016), compared to $8.4 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL inventory step-up (acquired in May 2015) and $3.2 million related to ACTIMMUNE inventory step-up (acquired in September 2014).\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $18.8 million to $60.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $41.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to $2.8 million of higher share-based compensation, an increase of $5.5 million in other employee costs resulting from growth in our headcount following the Hyperion, Crealta and Raptor acquisitions, $4.0 million related to costs to be incurred in the winding down of the STEADFAST study, an increase of $3.0 million in general research and development costs, a $2.0 million upfront fee paid for a license of a patent and an increase of $1.5 million in regulatory submission fees.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $99.9 million to $320.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $220.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was in line with the significant growth in gross sales and an increase in the number of sales representatives over the same period, which primarily contributed to an increase of $52.2 million in employee costs resulting from increased staffing of our field sales force and an increase of $47.7 million in marketing and commercialization expenses following the Hyperion, Crealta and Raptor acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $68.1 million to $287.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was attributable to $22.4 million of higher share-based compensation, $10.2 million in other employee costs resulting from growth in our headcount following the Hyperion, Crealta and Raptor acquisitions, an increase of $36.8 million in costs following the Hyperion, Crealta and Raptor acquisitions and $5.3 million due to the impairment of the initial amount paid to Boehringer Ingelheim International for certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, offset by a decrease of $6.6 million in acquisition-related general and administrative expenses.\nImpairment of In-Process Research and Development. At the time of the Vidara Merger, IPR&D was considered separable from the business as the project could be sold to a third party, and we assigned a fair value of $66.0 million to the intangible asset. Following the FA announcement, we determined that the IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased $16.7 million to $86.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $69.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increased interest expense, net, was primarily due to full-period recognition during the year ended December 31, 2016 of the interest on higher borrowings to fund the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, including our $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, six-year $400.0 million term loan facility, or the 2015 Term Loan Facility, and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2022, or the Exchangeable Senior Notes, as compared to partial period recognition of the interest on these borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015 and our lower prior year borrowings under our prior five-year $300.0 million term loan facility, or 2014 Term Loan Facility. We also incurred additional interest expense following our borrowings to fund the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016, including our additional $375.0 million additional borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility, or the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility, and the 2024 Senior Notes.\nForeign Exchange Loss. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a foreign exchange loss of $1.0 million.\nLoss on Induced Conversion of Debt and Debt Extinguishment. The loss on induced conversion of debt and debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $77.6 million was composed of $20.7 million related to the induced conversions of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, or Convertible Senior Notes, including $10.0 million for cash inducement payments, a $10.1 million charge for the extinguishment of debt and $0.6 million of expenses, and $56.9 million related to the extinguishment of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, consisting of a $45.4 million early redemption premium and a $11.5 million charge for the extinguishment of debt. The number of shares issued equaled the number of shares based on the underlying conversion option. The aggregate cash payments to the holders for additional exchange consideration were recorded as part of the extinguishment loss. There were no induced conversions in 2016.\nLoss on Sale of Long-Term Investments. The loss on sale of long-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $29.0 million. During the third quarter of 2015, we purchased 2,250,000 shares of common stock of Depomed, Inc., or Depomed, representing 3.75% of Depomed's then outstanding common stock. The shares were acquired at a cost of $71.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, following our decision to withdraw our offer to acquire Depomed, we sold all of our shares in Depomed, receiving sales proceeds of $42.8 million and recognized a realized loss of $29.0 million. There were no sales of long-term investments in 2016.\nOther Income (Expense) net. Other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to the release of a contingent liability of $6.9 million which was assumed as part of the Crealta acquisition. In December 2015, Crealta considered it probable that the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for KRYSTEXXA would be moved out of Israel based on a notice of termination provided by its contract manufacturer, therefore triggering a repayment obligation to Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist. As a result, Crealta established a $6.9 million contingent liability reserve in its December 31, 2015 financial statements. As of the date of our acquisition of Crealta, the $6.9 million repayment obligation was still probable. Therefore, it was recorded as an assumed liability in other long-term liabilities\u201d as part of the acquisition accounting for Crealta. During the third quarter of 2016, Horizon management negotiated a new amendment to the manufacturing agreement and it was determined that the manufacture of the KRYSTEXXA API would not be moved outside of Israel and thus the repayment of the $6.9 million would not be triggered. The contingent liability was released to other income (expense)\u201d during the year ended December 31, 2016 as it was a reversal of an assumed liability and therefore did not represent income from operations. Other expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $10.3 million, which primarily included the fees related to the Hyperion acquisition financing commitment.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $61.3 million compared to $172.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The recognition of income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the mix of income and losses amongst jurisdictions, a notional interest deduction and the change in our U.S. state effective tax rate. The recognition of an income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the release of $103.1 million in valuation allowances in the U.S. tax consolidation group due to the recognition of significant deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Hyperion acquisition as well as the ability to recognize a tax benefit on losses incurred in the United States.\nYear

Net sales increased $107.1 million, or 129%, to $190.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $83.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. DUEXIS net sales increased $58.0 million as a result of prescription volume growth driven by the expansion of our field sales force and increased $49.1 million due to higher net pricing resulting from wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, price increases partially offset by additional patient co-pay reimbursements.\nVIMOVO. Net sales increased $3.7 million, or 2%, to $166.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $163.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. VIMOVO net sales increased by $23.5 million resulting from prescription volume growth, offset by a decrease of $19.8 million due to lower net pricing. While we have increased the WAC price for VIMOVO over the last 12 months, the increases were more than offset by additional patient co-pay reimbursements.\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales were $147.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing PENNSAID 2% sales in January 2015 following our acquisition of the U.S. rights to PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo in October 2014.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales increased $82.2 million, or 326%, to $107.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales increased by approximately $47.1 million resulting from prescription volume growth and $35.1 million due to higher net pricing. We began recognizing ACTIMMUNE sales following the closing of the Vidara Merger on September 19, 2014, therefore only a partial period of ACTIMMUNE sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRAVICTI. Net sales were $86.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing RAVICTI sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $21.3 million, or 112%, to $40.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $19.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to prescription growth and net price increases resulting in higher net sales of approximately $20.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales were $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing BUPHENYL sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015.\nLODOTRA. Net sales decreased $1.6 million, or 25%, to $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was due to fewer shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occur at the time we ship, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales are not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and can therefore fluctuate significantly.\nThe table below reconciles our gross sales to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,057.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 600.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to gross sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prompt pay discounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicine returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Co-pay and other patient assistance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,020.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (138.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesaler fees and commercial rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government rebates and chargebacks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,300.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (303.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, co-pay and other patient assistance, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 49.6% from 23.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the rollout of our HorizonCares program to all sales territories during 2015 which helped ensure patient access to our medicines in the face of exclusionary actions by certain PBMs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, wholesaler fees and commercial rebates, as a percentage of gross sales, decreased to 3.2% from 17.0% during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in our managed care rebates following the termination of our agreements with CVS Caremark and Express Scripts in 2014.\nEffective January 1, 2015, two significant PBMs placed DUEXIS and VIMOVO on their exclusion lists, which resulted in a loss of reimbursement for patients whose healthcare plans have adopted these PBM exclusion lists. However, this action did not negatively impact sales volume for either medicine. In fact, with successful adoption of our HorizonCares program by physicians, we saw increases in sales volume for both medicines. During the year ended December 31, 2015, DUEXIS sales volumes increased by 70% and VIMOVO sales volumes increased by 14%, each, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased $140.7 million to $219.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $78.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 29.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 26.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to an increase in intangible amortization expense of $100.0 million, a $19.1 million increase in medicine costs associated with higher sales, higher royalty accretion expense of $11.1 million and a $10.5 million increase in charges relating to the remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities.\nThe increase in intangible amortization of $100.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in intangible amortization expense of $62.2 million in relation to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL (acquired on May 7, 2015), $31.1 million relating to ACTIMMUNE developed technology (acquired on September 19, 2014) and $7.3 million relating to PENNSAID 2% (U.S. rights acquired in October 2014).\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $24.4 million to $41.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $17.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily associated with $17.1 million in research and development expenses for ACTIMMUNE, RAVICTI and BUPHENYL, which included $4.0 million related to the STEADFAST study. We also recorded an increase of $5.1 million in share-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the increase in the number of employees involved in research and development activities following the Vidara Merger and Hyperion acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $100.1 million to $220.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $120.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects the growth in revenue and increase in the number of sales representatives over the same period, and was primarily attributable to an increase of $58.5 million in employee costs, including $18.9 million related to share-based compensation, resulting from the increased staffing of our field sales force and the expansion of our HorizonCares support team. We also recorded an increase of $22.0 million in marketing and commercialization expenses and an increase of $6.8 million in medicine samples distributed.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $130.9 million to $219.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $89.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $48.6 million in share-based compensation expense, $18.4 million in acquisition-related general and administrative expenses, and $63.9 million related to our growth in headcount, facilities, finance fees, legal fees and information technology expenses following the Vidara Merger and Hyperion acquisition.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased $46.1 million to $69.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased interest expense, net, was due to a full year of interest expense in 2015 on borrowings to fund the Vidara Merger in September 2014 and interest on additional borrowings to partially fund the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, including the 2023 Senior Notes, the 2015 Term Loan Facility, and the Exchangeable Senior Notes, as compared to our prior year borrowings under the Convertible Senior Notes and 2014 Term Loan Facility.\nForeign Exchange Loss. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported a foreign exchange loss of $1.2 million.\nLoss on Derivative Revaluation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $215.0 million non-cash charge related to the increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with our Convertible Senior Notes. The loss on the derivative revaluation was primarily due to an increase in the market value of HPI's common stock during the period from January 1, 2014 until June 27, 2014, the date HPI's stockholders approved the issuance of in excess of 13,164,951 shares of HPI's common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. The derivative liability was re-measured to a final fair value and the entire fair value of the derivative liability of $324.4 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. As such, there was no derivative revaluation subsequent to June 2014.\nLoss on Induced Conversion of Debt and Debt Extinguishment. The loss on induced conversion of debt and debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $77.6 million was composed of $20.7 million related to the induced conversions of Convertible Senior Notes, including $10.0 million for cash inducement payments, a $10.1 million charge for the extinguishment of debt and $0.6 million of expenses, and $56.9 million related to the extinguishment of the 2014 Term Loan Facility, consisting of a $45.4 million early redemption premium and a $11.5 million charge for the extinguishment of debt. The loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $29.4 million was a result of the Convertible Senior Notes induced conversions in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $16.7 million of loss on induced conversion for cash inducement payments, a $11.7 million charge for the extinguishment of debt and $1.0 million of expenses related to the induced debt conversions. The number of shares issued equaled the number of shares based on the underlying conversion option. The aggregate cash payments to the holders for additional exchange consideration were recorded as part of the extinguishment loss.\nLoss on Sale of Long-Term Investments. The loss on sale of long-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $29.0 million. During the third quarter of 2015, we purchased 2,250,000 shares of common stock of Depomed, representing 3.75% of Depomed's then outstanding common stock. The shares were acquired at a cost of $71.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, following our decision to withdraw our offer to acquire Depomed, we sold all of our shares in Depomed, receiving sales proceeds of $42.8 million and recognized a realized loss of $29.0 million in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nBargain Purchase Gain. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $22.2 million in connection with the Vidara Merger, representing the excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired over the acquisition consideration paid.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $10.3 million, which primarily included the fees related to the Hyperion acquisition financing commitment. Other expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $11.3 million, representing $5.0 million of commitment fees incurred on the bridge financing in place prior to executing the 2014 Term Loan Facility in June 2014, $3.2 million of commitment fees incurred on the 2014 Term Loan Facility prior to its funding on September 19, 2014 and $2.9 million secondary offering expense fees incurred in the November 2014 underwritten public offering.\nBenefit for Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $172.2 million compared to $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The recognition of income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the release of $103.1 million in valuation allowances in the U.S. tax consolidation group due to the recognition of significant deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Hyperion acquisition as well as the ability to recognize a tax benefit on losses incurred in the United States.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA are used and provided by us as non-GAAP financial measures. We provide certain other financial measures such as non-GAAP adjusted net sales, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share which include adjustments to GAAP figures. The exclusion of the $65.0 million litigation settlement from GAAP net sales is the only adjustment reflected in non-GAAP adjusted net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are intended to provide additional information on our performance, operations and profitability. Adjustments to our GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition-related expenses, charges related to the discontinuation of ACTIMMUNE development for FA, an upfront fee for a license of a patent, the Express Scripts litigation settlement amount, loss on debt extinguishment and loss on sale of long-term investments, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, inventory step-up expense, depreciation and amortization, remeasurement of royalties for medicines acquired through business combinations, royalty accretion, non-cash interest expense, the reversal of a pre-acquisition reserve upon the signing of a contract, intangible and other non-current asset impairment charges and other non-cash adjustments. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. We maintain an established non-GAAP cost policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of our financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of our historical financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators our management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring our performance. For example, adjusted EBITDA is used by us as one measure of management performance under certain incentive compensation arrangements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2016, we modified the method of calculating non-GAAP income tax expense to align with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2016. The new methodology calculates the income tax component of non-GAAP net income for each period by adjusting the GAAP tax expense (benefit) for the estimated tax impact of each non-GAAP adjustment based on the statutory income tax rate of the applicable jurisdictions for each non-GAAP adjustment. This new methodology does not reflect any use of net operating loss carryforwards that we potentially may have been able to use if our actual earnings for these periods had been the non-GAAP net income. Previously, we had calculated the income tax component of non-GAAP net income by using the estimated cash taxes that we expected to pay for the period. The non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share amounts shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables below are based on the new methodology.\nReconciliations of reported GAAP net sales to non-GAAP adjusted net sales, reported GAAP net (loss) income to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, and the related per share amounts, are as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in June 2005 and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $848.0 million. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as a result of our commercialization of our medicines, but we believe these cost increases will be more than offset by higher net sales and gross profits. We incurred an operating loss in 2016 primarily as a result of significant charges following the FA announcement in the fourth quarter of 2016, the litigation settlement with Express Scripts in September 2016 and costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions of Crealta and Raptor during the year. We expect our current operations to achieve operating profitability in 2017, absent unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe have financed our operations to date through equity financings, debt financings and the issuance of convertible notes, along with cash flows from operations during past three years. As of December 31, 2016, we had $509.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt with a book value of $1,807.5 million and face value of $1,944.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our business needs for the foreseeable future. Part of our strategy is to expand and leverage our commercial capabilities by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire medicines or businesses in the future, we will most likely need to finance a significant portion of those acquisitions through additional debt, equity or convertible debt financings.\nIn March 2015, April 2015 and June 2015, we entered into separate, privately negotiated conversion agreements with certain holders of the Convertible Senior Notes which were on substantially the same terms as prior conversion agreements entered into by us. Under these conversion agreements, the applicable holders agreed to convert an aggregate principal amount of $61.0 million of Convertible Senior Notes held by them and we agreed to settle such conversions by issuing an aggregate of 11,368,921 ordinary shares. In addition, pursuant to such conversion agreements, we made an aggregate cash payment of $10.0 million to the applicable holders for additional exchange consideration and $0.9 million for accrued and unpaid interest. Following these conversions, there were no Convertible Senior Notes remaining outstanding. The number of shares issued equaled the number of shares based on the underlying conversion option. The aggregate cash payments to the holders for additional exchange consideration were recorded as part of the extinguishment loss.\nOn March 13, 2015, Horizon Pharma Investment Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Horizon Pharma plc, or Horizon Investment, completed a private placement of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Exchangeable Senior Notes to several investment banks acting as initial purchasers who subsequently resold the Exchangeable Senior Notes to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Senior Notes were approximately $387.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses payable by Horizon Investment.\nWe have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Exchangeable Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis, referred to as the Guarantee. The Exchangeable Senior Notes and the Guarantee are Horizon Investment's and our senior unsecured obligations. The Exchangeable Senior Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 2.50% payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2015. The Exchangeable Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2022, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed. The initial exchange rate is 34.8979 of our ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $28.66 per ordinary share).\nOn April 21, 2015, we closed an underwritten public offering of 17,652,500 of our ordinary shares at a price to the public of $28.25 per share, referred to as the 2015 Offering. The net proceeds to us from the 2015 Offering were approximately $475.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses payable by us.\nOn April 29, 2015, Horizon Pharma Financing Inc., our then wholly owned subsidiary, or Horizon Financing, completed a private placement of $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes to certain investment banks acting as initial purchasers who subsequently resold the 2023 Senior Notes to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the 2023 Senior Notes were approximately $462.3 million.\nIn connection with the closing of the Hyperion acquisition on May 7, 2015, Horizon Financing merged with and into HPI and, as a result, the 2023 Senior Notes became HPI's general unsecured senior obligations and we and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries that are guarantors under the 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility (as described below) fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis HPI's obligations under the 2023 Senior Notes.\nThe 2023 Senior Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.625% payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2015. The 2023 Senior Notes will mature on May 1, 2023, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed.\nExcept as described below, the 2023 Senior Notes may not be redeemed before May 1, 2018. Thereafter, some or all of the 2023 Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. At any time prior to May 1, 2018, some or all of the 2023 Senior Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including the redemption date. Also prior to May 1, 2018, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 106.625% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings; provided that: (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued under the indenture (excluding notes held by the parent and its subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and (2) the redemption occurs with 180 days of the date of closing such equity offering. In addition, the 2023 Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the 2023 Senior Notes, HPI or any guarantor is or would be required to pay additional amounts as a result of certain tax related events.\nIf we undergo a change of control, HPI will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the 2023 Senior Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. If we or certain of our subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, HPI will be required under certain circumstances to make an offer to purchase the 2023 Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.\nOn May 7, 2015, we, HPI, and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with Citibank N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, or, as amended, the credit agreement, providing for (i) the six-year $400.0 million 2015 Term Loan Facility; (ii) an uncommitted accordion facility subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and other conditions; and (iii) one or more uncommitted refinancing loan facilities with respect to loans thereunder. This is referred to as the 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility. The initial borrower under the 2015 Term Loan Facility is HPI. The credit agreement allows for us and certain of our other subsidiaries to become borrowers under the accordion or refinancing facilities. Loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility bear interest, at each borrower's option, at a rate equal to either the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.0% per year (subject to a 1.0% LIBOR floor), or the adjusted base rate plus 3.0%. The adjusted base rate is defined as the greater of (a) LIBOR (using one-month interest period) plus 1.0%, (b) prime rate, (c) fed funds plus \u00bd of 1% and (d) 2.0%. We borrowed the full $400.0 million available under the 2015 Term Loan Facility on May 7, 2015 as a LIBOR-based borrowing. The net proceeds from the 2015 Term Loan Facility were approximately $391.5 million.\nThe obligations under the credit agreement and any swap obligations and cash management obligations owing to a lender (or an affiliate of a lender) thereunder are and will be guaranteed by our and each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, subsidiaries whose guarantee would result in material adverse tax consequences and subsidiaries whose guarantee is prohibited by applicable law). The obligations under the credit agreement and any such swap and cash management obligations are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by a perfected security interest in (i) all tangible and intangible assets of the borrowers and the guarantors, except for certain customary excluded assets, and (ii) all of the capital stock owned by the borrowers and guarantors thereunder (limited, in the case of the stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the borrowers, to 65% of the capital stock of such subsidiaries).\nWe are permitted to make voluntary prepayments at any time without payment of a premium. We are required to make mandatory prepayments of loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility (without payment of a premium) with (a) net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales (subject to reinvestment rights and other exceptions), (b) casualty proceeds and condemnation awards (subject to reinvestment rights and other exceptions), (c) net cash proceeds from issuances of debt (other than certain permitted debt), and (d) beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, 50% of our excess cash flow (subject to decrease to 25% or 0% if our first lien leverage ratio is less than 2.25:1 and 1.75:1, respectively). The loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount thereof, with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of the loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility.\nWe used the net proceeds from the 2015 Offering, the offering of the 2023 Senior Notes, borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility and existing cash to fund our acquisition of Hyperion, repay the $300.0 million outstanding amounts under the 2014 Term Loan Facility plus the related $45.4 million make-whole fee, and pay prepayment premiums, fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.\nOn October 25, 2016, HPI and Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, or HPUSA, and, together with HPI, the 2024 Issuers, completed a private placement of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes to certain investment banks acting as initial purchasers who subsequently resold the 2024 Senior Notes to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe 2024 Senior Notes are the 2024 Issuers' general unsecured senior obligations and we and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries that are guarantors under the 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis the 2024 Issuers' obligations under the 2024 Senior Notes.\nThe 2024 Senior Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 8.75% payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2017. The 2024 Senior Notes will mature on November 1, 2024, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed.\nExcept as described below, the 2024 Senior Notes may not be redeemed before November 1, 2019. Thereafter, some or all of the 2024 Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. At any time prior to November 1, 2019, some or all of the 2024 Senior Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Also prior to November 1, 2019, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 108.75% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. In addition, the 2024 Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the 2024 Senior Notes, the 2024 Issuers or any guarantor is or would be required to pay additional amounts as a result of certain tax-related events.\nIf we undergo a change of control, the 2024 Issuers will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the 2024 Senior Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. If we or certain of our subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, the 2024 Issuers will be required under certain circumstances to make an offer to purchase the 2024 Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.\nOn October 25, 2016, HPI and HPUSA, together, in such capacity, the Incremental Borrowers, entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, or the 2016 Amendment, with Citibank, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as the incremental B-1 lender thereunder, pursuant to which the Incremental Borrowers borrowed $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility. The 2016 Incremental Loan Facility was incurred as a separate class of term loans under the credit agreement with the same terms of loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility, except as described below.\nLoans under the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility bear interest, at each Incremental Borrowers' option, at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 4.50% per year (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.0%), or the adjusted base rate plus 3.50%. The terms of the loans under the 2015 Term Loan Facility, or the 2015 Loans, provided for an amendment such that the effective yield of the 2015 Loans would not be less than the effective yield of the loans under the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility, or the 2016 Incremental Loans, minus 0.50%. Consequently, the issuance of the 2016 Incremental Loans resulted in an increase of the interest rate applicable to the 2015 Loans, as of October 25, 2016, to LIBOR plus 4.00%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.0% (an initial interest rate of 5.00%). Borrowers under the credit agreement are permitted to make voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit agreement at any time without payment of a premium, except that with respect to the 2016 Incremental Loans, a 1% premium will apply to a repayment of the 2016 Incremental Loans in connection with a re-pricing of, or any amendment to the credit agreement in a re-pricing of, such loans effected on or prior to the date that is twelve months following October 25, 2016.\nWe used the net proceeds of the offering of the 2024 Senior Notes, borrowings under the 2016 Incremental Loan Facility and existing cash to fund our acquisition of Raptor, plus the related fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, including borrowing additional funds; increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and placing us at a disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIn addition, the indentures governing the 2024 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes and the credit agreement related to the 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility and 2016 Incremental Loan Facility impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments, incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock, incur liens on assets, engage in certain asset sales or merger transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued an aggregate of:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 666,984 ordinary shares in net settlement of vested restricted stock units;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 581,840 ordinary shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and received $3.9 million in proceeds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 513,659 ordinary shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plans and received $6.5 million in proceeds; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 13,584 ordinary shares in net settlement of vested performance stock units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 1,750 ordinary shares upon the cash exercise of warrants and we received proceeds of $8,000 representing the aggregate exercise price for such warrants. In addition, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 207,110 of our ordinary shares were exercised in cashless exercises, resulting in the issuance of 161,259 ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 1,372,660 of our ordinary shares.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we made payments of $5.5 million for employee withholding taxes relating to share-based awards.\nIn May 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 5,000,000 of our ordinary shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, including whether we decide to repurchase any shares pursuant to the authorization, will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of our ordinary shares, alternative investment opportunities, our cash resources, restrictions under our credit agreement, and market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, we had not purchased any of our ordinary shares under this repurchase program.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash position and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 509,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 859,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 218,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 369,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,375,881\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (995,048\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (227,720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 657,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,442,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $369.5 million, $194.2 million and $27.5 million, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was primarily attributable to higher cash collections from accounts receivable balances as a result of an increase in sales of medicines, partially offset by cash outlays for patient access programs, contractual allowances and government rebates and chargebacks and $32.5 million outlay for fifty percent of the litigation settlement amount with Express Scripts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to cash payments of $48.9 million for acquisition-related expenses and $60.8 million for interest payments made on our 2015 Term Loan Facility, 2016 Incremental Loan Facility, 2023 Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to cash payments of $68.2 million for acquisition-related expenses, including the payment in April 2015 of approximately $11.2 million of employee and director excise taxes due to the Vidara Merger. Cash payments during the year ended December 31, 2015 also included a $45.4 million early redemption premium related to the 2014 Term Loan Facility, $42.0 million of interest payments made on our 2014 Term Loan Facility, 2015 Term Loan Facility, 2023 Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes, and $10.0 million of cash payments related to induced debt conversions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was primarily attributable to cash collections from net sales, partially offset by cash outlays for related expenses. Cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was negatively impacted by $48.9 million in transaction costs related to the Vidara Merger, $2.9 million relating to the secondary offering of ordinary shares by certain stockholders in November 2014, and $16.7 million of cash payments related to induced debt conversions.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $1,375.9 million, $995.0 million and $227.7 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily related to $835.9 million of payments for the acquisition of Raptor, net of cash acquired, $514.8 million of payments for the acquisition of Crealta, net of cash acquired, a $5.6 million (\u20ac5.0 million) initial payment for certain non-U.S. intellectual property rights to interferon gamma-1b and $15.7 million of payments for purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2015 was primarily associated with $1,022.4 million of payments for the acquisition of Hyperion, net of cash acquired, and payments of $71.8 million made in relation to the purchase of 2,250,000 shares of common stock of Depomed. This was offset by proceeds of $42.8 million from the sale of such Depomed shares and proceeds from the liquidation of available-for-sale investments of $64.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2014 was primarily associated with the net cash paid for the Vidara Merger of $179.2 million and the acquisition of PENNSAID 2% of $45.0 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $657.1 million, $1,442.5 million and $338.3 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily related to $364.3 million of net proceeds received from borrowings under our 2016 Incremental Loan Facility and $291.9 million of net proceeds received from borrowings under our 2024 Senior Notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily attributable to $387.2 million of net proceeds received from borrowings under the Exchangeable Senior Notes, $391.5 million net proceeds from the 2015 Term Loan Facility, $462.3 million net proceeds from the 2023 Senior Notes and $475.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 17,652,500 ordinary shares in the 2015 Offering, partially offset by the repayment of the 2014 Term Loan Facility and a partial repayment of the 2015 Term Loan Facility, which resulted in a financing outflow of $299.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was primarily attributable to $287.0 million of net proceeds received under our prior $300.0 million five-year senior secured credit facility in connection with the Vidara Merger in September 2014. In addition, during 2014, we received proceeds of $38.5 million in connection with the exercise of warrants to purchase 8,990,120 ordinary shares, and received $9.4 million of cash proceeds from the settlement of the capped call termination in September 2014.\nFinancial Condition as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015\nAccounts receivable, net. Accounts receivable, net, increased $95.3 million, from $210.4 million as of December 31, 2015 to $305.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is due to growth in gross sales of our medicines, from 2015 to 2016. There has not been a material change to the ageing of our accounts receivable balances.\nInventories, net. Inventories, net, increased $156.4 million, from $18.4 million as of December 31, 2015 to $174.8 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to $95.3 million of stepped-up KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory at December 31, 2016 recorded as a result of the Crealta acquisition in January 2016 and $44.0 million of stepped-up PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory at December 31, 2016 recorded as a result of the Raptor acquisition in October 2016.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $33.7 million, from $15.9 million as of December 31, 2015 to $49.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to $9.2 million of quarterly estimated income tax installments prepaid as of December 31, 2016, a $7.8 million deferred charge for taxes on intra-group profit, an increase of $5.5 million in medicine samples inventory, an increase of $3.4 million in value added tax receivable and an additional $2.3 million of rabbi trust assets held at December 31, 2016.\nDeveloped technology, net. Developed technology, net, increased $1,158.1 million, from $1,609.1 million as of December 31, 2015 to $2,767.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is due to $428.2 million of KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT developed technology acquired in the Crealta acquisition in January 2016 and $946.0 million of PROCYSBI developed technology acquired in the Raptor acquisition, offset by $216.1 million of amortization of developed technology during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn-process research and development. In-process research and development decreased $66.0 million, from $66.0 million as of December 31, 2015 to a zero balance as of December 31, 2016. Following the decision to discontinue the STEADFAST program, we determined that the IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill. Goodwill increased $191.8 million, from $253.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to $445.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is due to $189.1 million of goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016 and $9.9 million of goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016, offset by an adjustment related to deferred tax liabilities of Hyperion which resulted in a decrease to goodwill of $7.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccounts payable. Accounts payable increased $35.9 million, from $16.6 million as of December 31, 2015 to $52.5 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to $16.8 million of trade discounts and rebates included within accounts payable as of December 31, 2016 and increased expenses and payments following our acquisitions of Crealta and Raptor during the year.\nAccrued expenses. Accrued expenses increased $82.8 million, from $100.0 million as of December 31, 2015 to $182.8 million as of December 31, 2016. This is primarily due to a $32.5 million unpaid litigation settlement amount as of December 31, 2016, following the litigation settlement with Express Scripts in September 2016, an increase of $16.5 million in consulting and professional services fee accruals, an increase in payroll-related accrued expenses of $14.5 million, $9.5 million related to a loss on inventory purchase commitments and an increase of $8.3 million in accrued interest as a result of our increased borrowings to fund the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nAccrued trade discounts and rebates. Accrued trade discounts and rebates increased $113.8 million, from $183.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to $297.6 million as of December 31, 2016. This is due to a $74.3 million increase in accrued co-pay and other patient assistance, a $26.4 million increase in accrued wholesaler fees and commercial rebates, and a $13.1 million increase in accrued government rebates and chargebacks. These increases are in line with the increase in gross sales during the period.\nLong-term debt, net, net of current. Long-term debt, net, net of current, increased $651.8 million, from $849.9 million as of December 31, 2015 to $1,501.7 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase is due to our increased borrowings to fund the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016 including the $371.3 million non-current portion of our 2016 Incremental Loan Facility and the $300.0 million 2024 Senior Notes, offset by a $15.5 million net increase in debt discount and deferred financing fees and $4.0 million reclassified to long-term debt, current portion, during the year relating to the 2015 Term Loan Facility.\nAccrued royalties, net of current. Accrued royalties, net of current, increased $148.8 million, from $123.5 million as of December 31, 2015 to $272.3 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT contingent royalties of $65.8 million at December 31, 2016 as a result of the Crealta acquisition in January 2016 and PROCYSBI contingent royalties of $94.9 million at December 31, 2016 as a result of the Raptor acquisition in October 2016.\nDeferred tax liabilities, net. Deferred tax liabilities, net, increased $183.5 million, from $113.4 million as of December 31, 2015 to $296.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the recording of $237.2 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Raptor on October 25, 2016 and $20.1 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Crealta on January 13, 2016. This was offset by the reduction of $9.2 million in acquired deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change in our U.S. state effective tax rate after our acquisition of Raptor on October 25, 2016 and a reduction of $8.1 million in the deferred tax liabilities of the U.S. group of companies following an the overall reduction in the U.S. state effective tax rate from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. In addition, other activity during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting from business operations further reduced the deferred tax liabilities, net by $56.5 million.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities increased $36.7 million, from $9.4 million as of December 31, 2015 to $46.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to a $25.5 million assumed contingent liability arising following our acquisition of Raptor in October 2016, a $4.8 million liability related to the non-current portion of the loss on purchase commitments for inventory which is in excess of our current forecasts for future demand and a $2.3 million increase in long-term deferred compensation plan liabilities.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, minimum future cash payments due under contractual obligations, including, among others, our debt agreements, minimum purchase agreements and non-cancelable operating lease agreements, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt agreements -

Due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any. Therefore, our contingent liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.\nIn addition to the obligations set out in the above table, we have assumed material obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to certain third parties on net sales of certain of our medicines as outlined below.\nUnder the license agreement with Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Aralez, we are required to pay Aralez a flat 10% royalty on net sales of VIMOVO and such other medicines sold by us, our affiliates or sublicensees during the royalty term, subject to minimum annual royalty obligations of $5.0 million in 2014 and $7.5 million each year thereafter, which minimum royalty obligations will continue for each year during which one of Aralez's patents covers such medicines in the United States and there are no competing medicines in the United States. The royalty rate may be reduced to a mid-single digit royalty rate as a result of loss of market share to competing medicines. Our obligation to pay royalties to Aralez will expire upon the later of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire of certain patents covering such medicines in the United States, and (b) ten years after the first commercial sale of such medicines in the United States. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse Aralez for costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred by Aralez in connection with VIMOVO patent litigation moving forward, subject to agreed caps.\nUnder a letter agreement among AstraZeneca, Aralez and us, we and AstraZeneca agreed to pay Aralez milestone payments upon the achievement by us and AstraZeneca, collectively, of certain annual aggregate global net sales thresholds ranging from $550.0 million to $1.25 billion with respect to VIMOVO. The aggregate milestone payment amount that may be owed by AstraZeneca and us, collectively, under the letter agreement is $260.0 million, with the amount payable by each of us and AstraZeneca with respect to each milestone to be based upon the proportional sales achieved by each of us and AstraZeneca, respectively, in the applicable year.\nUnder the terms of a license agreement, as amended, with Genentech Inc., or Genentech, who was the original developer of ACTIMMUNE, we are or were obligated to pay royalties to Genentech on our net sales of ACTIMMUNE as follows:\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> For the period from November 26, 2014 through May 5, 2018, the royalty payments are in the 20% to 30% range for the first $3.7 million in net sales achieved in any calendar year, and in the 1% to 9% range for all additional net sales in any year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> From May 6, 2018 and for so long as we continue to commercially sell ACTIMMUNE, we will be obligated to pay an annual royalty in the low single digits as a percentage of annual net sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of an assignment and option agreement with Connetics Corporation (which was the predecessor parent company to InterMune Pharmaceuticals Inc. and is now part of GlaxoSmithKline), or Connetics, we are obligated to pay royalties to Connetics on our net sales of ACTIMMUNE as follows:\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Low-single digits as a percentage of net sales of ACTIMMUNE in the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of an asset purchase agreement with Ucyclyd Pharma, Inc., or Ucyclyd, we are obligated to pay to Ucyclyd tiered mid to high single-digit royalties on our global net sales of RAVICTI.\nUnder the terms of an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Ucyclyd, we are obligated to pay to Ucyclyd tiered mid to high single-digit royalties on our net sales in the United States of BUPHENYL to UCD patients outside of the FDA approved labeled age range for RAVICTI.\nUnder the terms of a license agreement with Saul W. Brusilow, M.D. and Brusilow Enterprises, Inc., or Brusilow, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties to Brusilow on net sales of RAVICTI that are covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent.\nUnder the terms of a license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, and Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, or MVP, we are obligated to pay Duke a mid-single digit royalty on our global net sales of KRYSTEXXA and a low-double digit royalty on any global sublicense revenue. We are also obligated to pay MVP a mid-single digit royalty on our net sales of KRYSTEXXA outside of the United States and a low-double digit to royalty on any sublicense revenue outside of the United States.\nUnder the terms of a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, San Diego, or UCSD, we are obligated to pay to UCSD tiered low to mid single-digit royalties on our net sales of PROCYSBI.\nOn November 8, 2016, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with a privately held life-science entity. Under the terms of the agreement, the privately held life-science entity will conduct certain research and pre-clinical and clinical development activities. Upon execution of the agreement, we paid $0.1 million for the option to acquire certain of the privately held life-science entity's assets for $25.0 million, which is exercisable on specified key dates. Under the collaboration and option agreement, we will be required to pay up to $9.8 million upon the attainment of various milestones, primarily to fund clinical development costs for the medicine.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, other than the indemnification agreements discussed in Note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management's most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should also be read in conjunction with Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. Some of our agreements contain multiple elements and in accordance with these agreements, we may be eligible for upfront license fees, marketing or commercial milestones and payment for medicine deliveries.\nRevenue From Medicine Deliveries\nRevenue from medicine deliveries comprises a significant amount of our gross sales. We recognize revenue from the sale of our medicines when delivery has occurred, title has transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, the right of return no longer exists (which is the earlier of medicine being dispensed through patient prescriptions or the expiration of the right of return) or medicine returns can be reasonably estimated, collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Due to our ability to reasonably estimate and determine allowances for co-pay and other patient assistance, medicine returns, rebates and discounts based on our own internal data for DUEXIS and RAYOS or data relating to prior sales of our acquired medicines which was received in connection with the acquisition of those medicines, we recognize revenue at the point of sale to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and retail chains for all currently distributed medicines.\nRevenue From Upfront License Fees\nWe recognize revenues from the receipt of non-refundable, upfront license fees. In situations where the licensee is able to obtain stand-alone value from the license and no further performance obligations exist on our part, revenues are recognized on the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured. Where continuing involvement by us is required in the form of technology transfer, medicine manufacturing or technical support, revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement.\nRevenue From Milestone Receipts\nMilestone payments are recognized as revenue based on achievement of the associated milestones, as defined in the relevant agreements. Revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned, as evidenced by acknowledgment from our partner, provided that (1) the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, (2) the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process and (3) the milestone payment is non-refundable. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue from the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement.\nMedicine Sales Discounts and Allowances\nWe record allowances for medicine returns, rebates and discounts at the time of sale to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and retail chains. We are also required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances. If actual results differ from our estimates, we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future.\nCommercial Rebates\nWe participate in certain commercial rebate programs. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the commercial entity or third-party administrator of the program. We accrue estimated rebates based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine sold to qualified patients and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and record the rebate as a reduction of revenue. Accrued commercial rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDistribution Service Fees\nWe include distribution service fees paid to our wholesalers for distribution and inventory management services as a reduction to revenue. We accrue estimated distribution fees based on contractually determined amounts, typically as a percentage of revenue, and record the fees as a reduction of revenue. Accrued distribution service fees are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nPatient Access Programs\nWe offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription. In certain circumstances when a patient's prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription. We reimburse pharmacies for this discount through third-party vendors. We reduce gross sales by the amount of actual co-pay and other patient assistance in the period based on the invoices received. We also record an accrual to reduce gross sales for estimated co-pay and other patient assistance on units sold to distributors that have not yet been prescribed/dispensed to a patient. The estimate is based on contract prices, estimated percentages of medicine that will be prescribed to qualified patients, average assistance paid based on reporting from the third-party vendors and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Accrued co-pay and other patient assistance fees are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet. Patient assistance programs include both co-pay assistance and fully bought down prescriptions.\nSales Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return medicine within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the medicine expiration date. Generally, medicine may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date and up to one year after its expiration date. The right of return expires on the earlier of one year after the medicine expiration date or the time that the medicine is dispensed to the patient. The majority of our medicine returns are the result of medicine dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customer may return medicine. This period is known to us based on the shelf lives of our medicines at the time of shipment. We record sales returns as an allowance against accounts receivable and a reduction of revenue.\nPrompt Pay Discounts\nAs an incentive for prompt payment, we offer a 2% cash discount to customers. We expect that all customers will comply with the contractual terms to earn the discount. We record the discount as an allowance against accounts receivable and a reduction of revenue.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe participate in certain federal government rebate programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We accrue estimated rebates based on estimated percentages of medicine sold to qualified patients, estimated rebate percentages and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel that will be sold to qualified patients and record the rebates as a reduction of revenue. Accrued government rebates are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nGovernment Chargebacks\nWe provide discounts to federal government qualified entities with whom we have contracted. These federal entities purchase medicines from the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors at a discounted price, and the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the contracted price that the federal entities paid for the medicine. We accrue estimated chargebacks based on contract prices and sell-through sales data obtained from third-party information and record the chargeback as a reduction of revenue. Accrued government chargebacks are included in accrued trade discounts and rebates\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCost of Goods Sold\nWe recognize cost of goods sold in connection with our sales of each of our distributed medicines. Cost of goods sold includes all costs directly related to the acquisition of our medicines from our third-party manufacturers, including freight charges and other direct expenses such as insurance and supply chain costs. Cost of goods sold also includes amortization of intellectual property as described in the intangible assets and goodwill accounting policy below, inventory step-up expense, royalty payments to third parties, royalty accretion expense, changes in estimates associated with the contingent royalty liability as described in the accrued contingent royalty accounting policy below and loss on inventory purchase commitments.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review our intangible assets when events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their fair value. We measure fair value based on the estimated future discounted cash flows associated with our assets in addition to other assumptions and projections that we deem to be reasonable and supportable. The total estimated useful lives, from the date of acquisition, for all identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are as follows:\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> Intangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Estimated Useful Life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ACTIMMUNE developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BUPHENYL developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> KRYSTEXXA developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LODOTRA and RAYOS developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MIGERGOT developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PENNSAID 2% developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PROCYSBI developed technology (ex-U.S. rights)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PROCYSBI developed technology (U.S. rights)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RAVICTI developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIMOVO developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determined that no impairment of the above intangible assets existed as of December 31, 2016.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized IPR&D. IPR&D assets represent capitalized incomplete research projects that we acquired through business combinations. Such assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair values and are tested for impairment, until completion or abandonment of research and development efforts associated with the projects. An IPR&D asset is considered abandoned when research and development efforts associated with the asset have ceased, and there are no plans to sell or license the asset or derive value from the asset. At that point, the asset is considered to be disposed of and is written off. Upon successful completion of each project, we will make a determination about the then remaining useful life of the intangible asset and begin amortization. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles, including IPR&D assets, for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.\nIPR&D as of December 31, 2015 related to the research and development project to evaluate ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA, which we acquired in the Vidara Merger. At the time of the Vidara Merger, IPR&D was considered separable from the business as the project could be sold to a third party, and we assigned a fair value of $66.0 million to the intangible asset using an income approach in our purchase accounting. On December 8, 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 trial, STEADFAST, evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline in the modified FARS-mNeuro at twenty-six weeks versus treatment with placebo. In addition, the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance. No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved indications. We, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and FARA, Collaborative Clinical Research Network in FA, determined that, based on the trial results, the STEADFAST program would be discontinued, including the twenty-six week extension study and the long-term safety study. The IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value as a result of the cancellation of the project, and we recorded an impairment charge of $66.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized based on a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying value, without consideration of any recoverability. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If we conclude that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income. Based upon our most recent annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, we concluded goodwill was not impaired.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the pronouncement guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations, in which acquired assets and liabilities are measured at their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. We may be required, as in the case of intangible assets or contingent royalties, to determine the fair value associated with these amounts by estimating the fair value using an income approach under the discounted cash flow method, which may include revenue projections and other assumptions made by us to determine the fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $22.2 million in connection with the Vidara Merger, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition consideration paid. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded goodwill of $253.8 million in connection with the acquisition of Hyperion, and we recorded an adjustment of $7.2 million to this amount during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded goodwill of $9.9 million and $189.1 million in connection with our acquisitions of Crealta and Raptor, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted. We also account for the uncertainty in income taxes by utilizing a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on an income tax return. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted by jurisdiction on our consolidated balance sheets.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for employee share-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based payments based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each awardee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nAccrued Contingent Royalties\nOur accrued contingent royalties consist of the contingent royalty obligations assumed by us related to our acquisitions of rights to ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, KRYSTEXXA, MIGERGOT, PROCYSBI, RAVICTI and VIMOVO. At the time of each acquisition, we assigned a fair value to the liability for royalties. The royalty liability was based on anticipated revenue streams utilizing the income approach under the discounted cash flow method. The estimated liability for royalties is increased or decreased over time to reflect the change in its present value, and accretion expense is recorded as part of cost of goods sold. We evaluate the adequacy of the estimated contingent royalty liability at least annually in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an evaluation of the estimate is necessary. As part of our evaluation, we adjust the carrying value of the liability to the present value of the revised estimated cash flows using the original discount rate.\nAny adjustment to the liability is recorded as an increase or reduction in cost of goods sold. The royalty liability is included in current and long-term accrued royalties on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, based on higher sales of KRYSTEXXA and RAVICTI versus our previous expectations and estimates for future sales of these medicines, we recorded a total charge of $24.6 million to cost of goods sold ($15.4 million related to KRYSTEXXA and $9.2 million related to RAVICTI). We also recorded a reduction of $24.2 million to cost of goods sold related to ACTIMMUNE and VIMOVO as a result of updated estimates of future sales of these medicines ($8.7 million related to ACTIMMUNE, including $2.5 million in connection with FA, and $15.5 million related to VIMOVO).\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nAt December 31, 2013 and at the final measurement on June 27, 2014, the estimated fair value of our derivative liability related to the convertible portion of our Convertible Senior Notes was derived utilizing the binomial lattice approach for the valuation of convertible instruments. Assumptions used in the calculation included, among others, determining the appropriate credit spread using benchmarking analysis and solving for the implied credit spread, calculating the fair value of the stock component using a discounted risk free rate and borrowing cost and calculating the fair value of the note component using a discounted credit adjusted discount rate. Based on the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the Convertible Senior Notes, we concluded that these inputs were Level 3 inputs.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Impacting Critical Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, which includes a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements impacting critical accounting policies.", "summary": "The report discusses the company's financial condition and operations, cautioning that forward-looking statements carry risk and uncertainties.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d will,\u201d and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements.

All references to Vidara\u201d are references to Horizon Pharma plc (formerly known as Vidara Therapeutics International Public Limited Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger of the businesses of HPI and Vidara on September 19, 2014, or the Vidara Merger. The disclosures in this report relating to the pre-Vidara Merger business of Horizon Pharma plc, unless noted as being the business of Vidara prior to the Vidara Merger, pertain to the business of HPI prior to the Vidara Merger.\nOur Business\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients' lives by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs. We market eleven medicines through our orphan, rheumatology and primary care business units. Our marketed medicines are ACTIMMUNE\u00ae (interferon gamma-1b), BUPHENYL\u00ae (sodium phenylbutyrate) Tablets and Powder, DUEXIS\u00ae (ibuprofen/famotidine), KRYSTEXXA\u00ae (pegloticase), MIGERGOT\u00ae (ergotamine tartrate & caffeine suppositories), PENNSAID\u00ae (diclofenac sodium topical solution) 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, PROCYSBI\u00ae (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules, QUINSAIR\u2122 (aerosolized form of levofloxacin), RAVICTI\u00ae (glycerol phenylbutyrate) Oral Liquid, RAYOS\u00ae (prednisone) delayed-release tablets and VIMOVO\u00ae (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium).\nWe developed DUEXIS and RAYOS, known as LODOTRA\u00ae outside the United States, acquired the U.S. rights to VIMOVO from AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, in November 2013, acquired certain rights to ACTIMMUNE as a result of the Vidara Merger in September 2014, acquired the U.S. rights to PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo Research Inc., or Nuvo, in October 2014, acquired RAVICTI and BUPHENYL, known as AMMONAPS\u00ae in certain European countries, as a result of our acquisition of Hyperion Therapeutics Inc., or Hyperion, in May 2015, acquired KRYSTEXXA and the U.S. rights to MIGERGOT as a result of our acquisition of Crealta Holdings LLC., or Crealta, in January 2016 and acquired PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR as a result of our acquisition of Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp., or Raptor, in October 2016.\nOn January 13, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Crealta for approximately $539.7 million, including cash acquired of $24.9 million. Following completion of the acquisition, Crealta became our wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed Horizon Pharma Rheumatology LLC.\nOn May 18, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim International, to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, which Boehringer Ingelheim International currently commercializes under the trade names IMUKIN\u00ae, IMUKINE\u00ae, IMMUKIN\u00ae and IMMUKINE\u00ae in an estimated thirty countries primarily in Europe and the Middle East. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Boehringer Ingelheim International \u20ac5.0 million ($5.6 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of payment of 1.1132) upon signing and will pay \u20ac20.0 million upon closing, for certain rights for interferon gamma-1b in all territories outside of the United States, Canada and Japan, as we currently hold marketing rights to interferon gamma-1b in these territories. We currently market interferon gamma-1b as ACTIMMUNE in the United States. The transaction is expected to close in 2017 and we are continuing to work with Boehringer Ingelheim International to enable the transfer of applicable marketing authorizations. We recorded an impairment charge of \u20ac5.0 million ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052) during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the initial payment on our consolidated balance sheet, and upon closing we expect to record the additional \u20ac20.0 million payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income. See Results from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\u201d section below for further details.\nOn October 25, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Raptor in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Raptor's common stock for $9.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $860.8 million, including cash acquired of $24.9 million and $56.0 million to repay Raptor's outstanding debt. Following completion of the acquisition, Raptor became our wholly owned subsidiary and converted to a limited liability company, changing its name to Horizon Pharmaceutical LLC. We financed the transaction through $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans pursuant to an amendment to our existing credit agreement and cash on hand.\nPart of our commercial strategy for RAYOS and our primary care medicines is to offer physicians the opportunity to have their patients fill prescriptions through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient access program. For commercial patients who are prescribed our primary care medicines or RAYOS, the HorizonCares program offers co-pay assistance when a third-party commercial payer covers a prescription but requires an eligible patient to pay a co-pay or deductible, and offers full subsidization when a third-party commercial payer rejects coverage for an eligible patient. During 2016, we entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our medicines, such as our arrangements with Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Prime Therapeutics LLC. While we believe that this strategy will result in broader inclusion of certain of our primary care medicines on healthcare plan formularies, and therefore increase payer reimbursement and lower our cost of providing patient access programs, these arrangements generally require us to pay administrative and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payers.\nWe market our medicines in the United States through our field sales force, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2016. Our strategy is to continue to build a well-balanced, diversified, high-growth biopharmaceutical company. We are executing this through the successful commercialization of our existing medicines, a strong commitment to patient access and support and business development efforts focused on transformative acquisitions to accelerate our rare disease leadership as well as on-market and development-stage medicines to fill out our pipeline.\nWe are building a sustainable biopharmaceutical company by helping ensure that patients have access to their medicines and support services, and by investing in the further development of medicines for patients with rare or underserved diseases. Our growing business is diversified across three business units: orphan, rheumatology and primary care, and is driven by a successful commercial model that focuses on differentiated, long-life medicines, innovative patient access programs and a disciplined business development strategy.\nResults from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\nOn December 8, 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 trial, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study, or STEADFAST, evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, or FA, did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline in the modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale, or FARS-mNeuro, at twenty-six weeks versus treatment with placebo and that the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance, or the FA announcement. No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved indications. We, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, or FARA, Collaborative Clinical Research Network in FA, determined that, based on the trial results, the STEADFAST program would be discontinued, including the twenty-six week extension study and the long-term safety study.\nFollowing the FA announcement, we recorded the following amounts in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nNote 1 In-process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the research and development project to evaluate ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA, which we acquired in the Vidara Merger. At the time of the Vidara Merger, IPR&D was considered separable from the business as the project could be sold to a third party, and we assigned a fair value of $66.0 million to the intangible asset using an income approach in our purchase accounting. Following the FA announcement, we determined that the IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 2 As described above, on May 18, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, and we paid Boehringer Ingelheim International \u20ac5.0 million upon signing. The purchase price was determined with the expectation that the STEADFAST study would be successful. Following the FA announcement, we determined that this payment, which was recorded in other assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet was impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052). Upon closing, we will pay Boehringer Ingelheim International an additional \u20ac20.0 million and we expect to record this payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNote 3 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we committed to purchase additional units of ACTIMMUNE from Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional units of ACTIMMUNE were intended to cover anticipated demand if the results of the STEADFAST study of ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA had been successful. Following the FA announcement, we recorded a loss of $14.3 million for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our current forecasts for future demand. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also committed to incur an additional $14.9 million for the harmonization of the drug substance manufacturing process with Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional costs have not been included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss or our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.\nNote 4 At the time of the Vidara Merger, we assigned a fair value to a contingent liability for royalties potentially payable under previously existing royalty and licensing agreements related to ACTIMMUNE, which included an amount of $2.5 million for estimated future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA. Following the FA announcement, we recorded an adjustment to reduce the contingent royalty liability for ACTIMMUNE by $2.5 million as we do not anticipate future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA.\nNote 5 Following the FA announcement, we recorded an amount of $4.0 million at December 31, 2016 related to costs anticipated to be incurred to discontinue the STEADFAST study. These costs will be incurred without economic benefit to us, and represent costs to us to wind down the study under U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, protocol.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\n * Percentage change is not meaningful. \nNet sales. Net sales increased $224.1 million, or 30%, to $981.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $757.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents a summary of total net sales attributed to geographic sources for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nThe following table reflects the components of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\n * Percentage change is not meaningful. \nThe increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the growth in net sales of PENNSAID 2%, the full-period recognition of RAVICTI sales in 2016, compared to a partial period recognition in 2015 following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, the recognition of KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016 and the recognition of PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016, offset by the $65.0 million litigation settlement with Express Scripts along with lower net sales of VIMOVO and DUEXIS.\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales increased $157.4 million, or 107%, to $304.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $147.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $87.5 million due to higher net pricing and $69.9 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nDUEXIS. Net sales decreased $16.6 million, or 9%, to $173.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $190.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $50.4 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance, offset by an increase of approximately $33.8 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nRAVICTI. Net sales increased $64.7 million, or 74%, to $151.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $86.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $55.7 million resulting from prescription volume growth and $9.0 million due to higher net pricing. We began recognizing RAVICTI sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of RAVICTI sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nVIMOVO. Net sales decreased $45.4 million, or 27%, to $121.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $166.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $35.9 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance and approximately $9.5 million resulting from lower prescription volumes.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales decreased $2.8 million, or 3%, to $104.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $107.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $8.8 million resulting from prescription volume decreases, offset by an increase of approximately $6.0 million due to higher net pricing.\nKRYSTEXXA. Net sales were $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $7.0 million, or 17%, to $47.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $40.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $8.4 million resulting from prescription volume growth, offset by a decrease of approximately $1.4 million due to lower net pricing.\nPROCYSBI. Net sales were $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales increased $3.4 million, or 25%, to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing BUPHENYL sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of BUPHENYL sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMIGERGOT. Net sales were $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing MIGERGOT sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nLODOTRA. Net sales decreased $0.7 million, or 14%, to $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to fewer shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occur at the time we ship, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales are not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and can therefore fluctuate significantly.\nQUINSAIR. Net sales were $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing QUINSAIR sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Express Scripts pursuant to which we and Express Scripts were released from any and all claims relating to our then ongoing litigation without admitting any fault or wrongdoing and we agreed to pay Express Scripts $65.0 million. This settlement has been accounted for as a reduction of net sales\u201d in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe table below reconciles our gross sales to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, co-pay and other patient assistance, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 52.6% from 49.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our HorizonCares program during 2016.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patient deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased $173.8 million to $393.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $219.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 40.0% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 29.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The large increase in costs of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due to the one-time reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the litigation settlement with Express Scripts and an increase in cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of higher intangible amortization expense of $84.0 million and increased inventory step-up expense of $59.6 million. Other factors that caused cost of goods sold to increase during the year included a $14.3 million expense related to a loss on inventory purchase commitments, higher royalty accretion expense of $20.5 million and a $16.2 million increase in direct and indirect costs associated with higher sales, offset by a $20.8 million decrease in charges relating to the remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities.\nThe increase in intangible amortization of $84.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to a $33.9 million increase in amortization expense related to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL intangible assets (acquired in May 2015), $35.9 million amortization of developed technology related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT (acquired in January 2016), $14.0 million amortization", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We currently market interferon gamma-1b as ACTIMMUNE in the United States. The transaction is expected to close in 2017 and we are continuing to work with Boehringer Ingelheim International to enable the transfer of applicable marketing authorizations. We recorded an impairment charge of \u20ac5.0 million ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052) during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the initial payment on our consolidated balance sheet, and upon closing we expect to record the additional \u20ac20.0 million payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income. See Results from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\u201d section below for further details.\nOn October 25, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Raptor in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Raptor's common stock for $9.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $860.8 million, including cash acquired of $24.9 million and $56.0 million to repay Raptor's outstanding debt. Following completion of the acquisition, Raptor became our wholly owned subsidiary and converted to a limited liability company, changing its name to Horizon Pharmaceutical LLC. We financed the transaction through $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Senior Notes, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans pursuant to an amendment to our existing credit agreement and cash on hand.\nPart of our commercial strategy for RAYOS and our primary care medicines is to offer physicians the opportunity to have their patients fill prescriptions through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient access program. For commercial patients who are prescribed our primary care medicines or RAYOS, the HorizonCares program offers co-pay assistance when a third-party commercial payer covers a prescription but requires an eligible patient to pay a co-pay or deductible, and offers full subsidization when a third-party commercial payer rejects coverage for an eligible patient. During 2016, we entered into business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our medicines, such as our arrangements with Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Prime Therapeutics LLC. While we believe that this strategy will result in broader inclusion of certain of our primary care medicines on healthcare plan formularies, and therefore increase payer reimbursement and lower our cost of providing patient access programs, these arrangements generally require us to pay administrative and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payers.\nWe market our medicines in the United States through our field sales force, which numbered approximately 480 representatives as of December 31, 2016. Our strategy is to continue to build a well-balanced, diversified, high-growth biopharmaceutical company. We are executing this through the successful commercialization of our existing medicines, a strong commitment to patient access and support and business development efforts focused on transformative acquisitions to accelerate our rare disease leadership as well as on-market and development-stage medicines to fill out our pipeline.\nWe are building a sustainable biopharmaceutical company by helping ensure that patients have access to their medicines and support services, and by investing in the further development of medicines for patients with rare or underserved diseases. Our growing business is diversified across three business units: orphan, rheumatology and primary care, and is driven by a successful commercial model that focuses on differentiated, long-life medicines, innovative patient access programs and a disciplined business development strategy.\nResults from Phase 3 Study of ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia\nOn December 8, 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 trial, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study, or STEADFAST, evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, or FA, did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline in the modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale, or FARS-mNeuro, at twenty-six weeks versus treatment with placebo and that the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance, or the FA announcement. No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved indications. We, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, or FARA, Collaborative Clinical Research Network in FA, determined that, based on the trial results, the STEADFAST program would be discontinued, including the twenty-six week extension study and the long-term safety study.\nFollowing the FA announcement, we recorded the following amounts in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Financial Statement Line Item\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss/(Gain)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Note\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment of in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of non-current asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,480\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical trial wind-down costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote 1 In-process research and development, or IPR&D, related to the research and development project to evaluate ACTIMMUNE in the treatment of FA, which we acquired in the Vidara Merger. At the time of the Vidara Merger, IPR&D was considered separable from the business as the project could be sold to a third party, and we assigned a fair value of $66.0 million to the intangible asset using an income approach in our purchase accounting. Following the FA announcement, we determined that the IPR&D has no alternative use or economic value, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 2 As described above, on May 18, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International to acquire certain rights to interferon gamma-1b, and we paid Boehringer Ingelheim International \u20ac5.0 million upon signing. The purchase price was determined with the expectation that the STEADFAST study would be successful. Following the FA announcement, we determined that this payment, which was recorded in other assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet was impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2016 to fully write off the value of the asset ($5.3 million when converted using a Euro-to-Dollar exchange rate at date of impairment of 1.052). Upon closing, we will pay Boehringer Ingelheim International an additional \u20ac20.0 million and we expect to record this payment as an expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income.\nNote 3 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we committed to purchase additional units of ACTIMMUNE from Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional units of ACTIMMUNE were intended to cover anticipated demand if the results of the STEADFAST study of ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of FA had been successful. Following the FA announcement, we recorded a loss of $14.3 million for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our current forecasts for future demand. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also committed to incur an additional $14.9 million for the harmonization of the drug substance manufacturing process with Boehringer Ingelheim. These additional costs have not been included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss or our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.\nNote 4 At the time of the Vidara Merger, we assigned a fair value to a contingent liability for royalties potentially payable under previously existing royalty and licensing agreements related to ACTIMMUNE, which included an amount of $2.5 million for estimated future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA. Following the FA announcement, we recorded an adjustment to reduce the contingent royalty liability for ACTIMMUNE by $2.5 million as we do not anticipate future sales of ACTIMMUNE for FA.\nNote 5 Following the FA announcement, we recorded an amount of $4.0 million at December 31, 2016 related to costs anticipated to be incurred to discontinue the STEADFAST study. These costs will be incurred without economic benefit to us, and represent costs to us to wind down the study under U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, protocol.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear

December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the growth in net sales of PENNSAID 2%, the full-period recognition of RAVICTI sales in 2016, compared to a partial period recognition in 2015 following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, the recognition of KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016 and the recognition of PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016, offset by the $65.0 million litigation settlement with Express Scripts along with lower net sales of VIMOVO and DUEXIS.\nPENNSAID 2%. Net sales increased $157.4 million, or 107%, to $304.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $147.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $87.5 million due to higher net pricing and $69.9 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nDUEXIS. Net sales decreased $16.6 million, or 9%, to $173.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $190.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $50.4 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance, offset by an increase of approximately $33.8 million resulting from prescription volume growth.\nRAVICTI. Net sales increased $64.7 million, or 74%, to $151.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $86.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $55.7 million resulting from prescription volume growth and $9.0 million due to higher net pricing. We began recognizing RAVICTI sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of RAVICTI sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nVIMOVO. Net sales decreased $45.4 million, or 27%, to $121.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $166.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales decreased by approximately $35.9 million due to lower net pricing resulting from higher co-pay and other patient assistance and approximately $9.5 million resulting from lower prescription volumes.\nACTIMMUNE. Net sales decreased $2.8 million, or 3%, to $104.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $107.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net sales were $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing KRYSTEXXA sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nRAYOS. Net sales increased $7.0 million, or 17%, to $47.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $40.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales increased by approximately $8.4 million resulting from prescription volume growth, offset by a decrease of approximately $1.4 million due to lower net pricing.\nPROCYSBI. Net sales were $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing PROCYSBI sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nBUPHENYL. Net sales increased $3.4 million, or 25%, to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. We began recognizing BUPHENYL sales following the acquisition of Hyperion in May 2015, therefore only a partial period of BUPHENYL sales were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with full-period recognition of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMIGERGOT. Net sales were $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing MIGERGOT sales following the acquisition of Crealta in January 2016.\nLODOTRA. Net sales decreased $0.7 million, or 14%, to $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to fewer shipments to our European distribution partner, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma. LODOTRA sales to Mundipharma occur at the time we ship, based on Mundipharma's estimated requirements. Accordingly, LODOTRA sales are not linear or directly tied to Mundipharma's in-market sales and can therefore fluctuate significantly.\nQUINSAIR. Net sales were $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We began recognizing QUINSAIR sales following the acquisition of Raptor in October 2016.\nIn September 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Express Scripts pursuant to which we and Express Scripts were released from any and all claims relating to our then ongoing litigation without admitting any fault or wrongdoing and we agreed to pay Express Scripts $65.0 million. This settlement has been accounted for as a reduction of net sales\u201d in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe table below reconciles our gross sales to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Gross\nSales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,234.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,057.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to gross sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prompt pay discounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicine returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Co-pay and other patient assistance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,701.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,020.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesaler fees and commercial rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (133.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government rebates and chargebacks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (272.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,253.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,300.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 981.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 757.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, co-pay and other patient assistance, as a percentage of gross sales, increased to 52.6% from 49.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our HorizonCares program during 2016.\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, our net sales have traditionally been lower in first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with the second half of the year representing a greater share of overall net sales each year. This is due to annual managed care plan changes and the re-setting of patient deductibles at the beginning of each year, resulting in higher co-pay and other patient assistance costs as patients meet their annual deductibles during the first and second quarters, and higher net sales in the second half of the year after patients meet their deductibles and healthcare plans reimburse a greater portion of the total cost of our medicines.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased $173.8 million to $393.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $219.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold was 40.0% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 29.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The large increase in costs of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due to the one-time reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the litigation settlement with Express Scripts and an increase in cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of higher intangible amortization expense of $84.0 million and increased inventory step-up expense of $59.6 million. Other factors that caused cost of goods sold to increase during the year included a $14.3 million expense related to a loss on inventory purchase commitments, higher royalty accretion expense of $20.5 million and a $16.2 million increase in direct and indirect costs associated with higher sales, offset by a $20.8 million decrease in charges relating to the remeasurement of contingent royalty liabilities.\nThe increase in intangible amortization of $84.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to a $33.9 million increase in amortization expense related to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL intangible assets (acquired in May 2015), $35.9 million amortization of developed technology related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT (acquired in January 2016), $14.0 million amortization"}
