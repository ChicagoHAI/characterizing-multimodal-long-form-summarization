Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and financial condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report.\nBusiness overview\nWe provide a wide range of financial services through our 29 banking locations located in Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle and Will counties in Illinois. These banking centers offer access to a full range of traditional retail and commercial banking services including treasury management operations as well as fiduciary and wealth management services. We focus our business on establishing and maintaining relationships with our clients while maintaining a commitment to providing for the financial services needs of the communities in which we operate through our retail branch network. We emphasize relationships with individual customers as well as small to medium-sized businesses throughout our market area. Our market area includes a mix of commercial and industrial, real estate, and consumer related lending opportunities, and provides a stable, loyal core deposit base. We also offer extensive wealth management services, which include a registered investment advisory platform in addition to trust administration and trust services related to personal and corporate trusts, including employee benefit plan administration services.\nOur primary deposit products are checking, NOW, money market, savings, and certificate of deposit accounts, and our primary lending products are commercial mortgages, leases, construction lending, commercial loans, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. Many of our loans are secured by various forms of collateral including real estate, business assets, and consumer property although borrower cash flow is the primary source of repayment at the time of loan origination.\nOn April 20, 2018, we closed on our acquisition of Greater Chicago Financial Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABC Bank. As a result of this transaction, we acquired $227.6 million of loans, net of fair value adjustments, and $248.5 million of deposits, net of fair value adjustments. The purchase resulted in us increasing our presence in the near west Chicago area and metropolitan Chicago, as four branches were acquired with a retail and commercial client mix of loans and deposits.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. Federal and state governments have taken, and may continue to take, unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed and businesses and schools have reopened with some level of success, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly, which may cause a freezing or, in certain\ncases, a reversal of previously announced relaxation of activity restrictions and may prompt the need for additional aid and other forms of relief.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, adversely affecting many of our clients. The unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market interest rates have declined significantly, with the 10-year Treasury bond falling below 1.00% on March 3, 2020, for the first time, although bond yields have recently begun to rise, nearing where they were before the pandemic in February 2020. In March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the targeted federal funds interest rate range to 0% to 0.25% percent. These reductions in interest rates and the other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, possibly materially, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, the pandemic has had negative effects on our interest income, ACL, and certain transaction-based line items of noninterest income. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including the effect of governmental and private sector initiatives, the effect of the recent rollout of vaccinations for the virus, whether such vaccinations will be effective against any resurgence of the virus, including any new strain, and the ability for customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routine.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to protect our employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, as part of our efforts to exercise social distancing, we closed all of our banking lobbies (other than by appointment) and conducted most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. At this time, our lobbies have been reopened, but we encourage customers to use drive-thru or electronic means to conduct their banking, and are following social distancing and personal protective protocols as directed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, a majority of our workforce has been working from home since mid-March 2020, and we expect this to continue through at least the first quarter of 2021, or until vaccines are more widely available.\nResults of Operation and Financial Condition\nWe are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operation and financial condition. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly impacted the health of the overall real estate industry in our markets, which have reflected relative stability over the past three years. In addition, we have not experienced significant incurred losses on loans or received communications from our borrowers that significant losses were imminent. While management does not currently expect the next year to result in the precipitous decline in the value of certain real estate assets similar to the declines seen in 2009 to 2010, our forecast includes assumptions for certain loss scenarios that may occur due to the exhaustion of federal stimulus funds or a decrease in market valuations. Accordingly, in 2020, we determined it prudent to increase our provision for credit losses in anticipation of continued market risk and uncertainty at this time. Our provision for credit losses was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was unchanged from the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Our allowance for credit losses increased $14.1 million during 2020, which was impacted by both our adoption of the new CECL methodology and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions. Although we did not record additional provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, as periods ending after December 31, 2020 may also be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also adjust our investment securities portfolio to fair value each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold as well as experience reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $18.6 million of goodwill. As of March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2020, we considered whether a quantitative assessment of our goodwill was required because of the significant economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately determined that a quantitative assessment was not required at those period ends. At November 30, 2020, we performed our recurring annual review for any goodwill impairment. At the end of each of these periods, we determined no goodwill impairment existed. However, further delayed recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy, financial markets, and the associated impacts on our customers, employees and vendors, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLending Operations and Accommodations to Borrowers\nTo more fully support our customers during the pandemic, we established client assistance programs, including offering commercial, consumer, and mortgage loan payment deferrals for certain clients. During 2020, we executed 499 of these deferrals on loan balances of $231.3 million. In accordance with interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short term deferrals were not considered troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2020, 448 loans previously in deferral status, representing loan balances of $198.6 million, had resumed payments or paid off, and 51 loans totaling $32.7 million remained in active deferral status, of which only $4.4 million were in\nnonaccrual status. We also suspended late fees for consumer loans through June 30, 2020, and, although consumer late fees have been reinstated, we will continue to evaluate any late fee suspension based on the borrower's financial situation and prior payment history. In addition, we paused new foreclosure and repossession actions through December 31, 2020, and will continue to re-evaluate these activities based on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nWe are also participating in the CARES Act. During 2020, as part of the first round\u201d of the SBA PPP program, we processed 746 PPP loan applications, representing a total of $136.7 million. In early October, we started the application process for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect this process to continue through the first quarter of 2021, with funds to be received from the SBA for the forgiven loans well into the second quarter of 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had originated two loans for $305,000 under the Main Street Lending Program. We recorded $2.4 million of net fee income on PPP loans in 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, unearned net fee income on PPP loans totaled $420,000. Finally, with the governmental authorization of the second round\u201d of the SBA PPP in late 2020, we are now originating additional PPP loans, and anticipate filing for forgiveness of these loans with the SBA in the latter half of 2021.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by credit losses.\nWe believe there could be potential stresses on liquidity management as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, as customers manage their own liquidity stress, we could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of credit.\nWe have developed new processes to monitor our liquidity on a daily basis, and have run stress testing based on various economic assumptions under stress and severe stress scenarios. In addition, management continues to communicate each week in structured meetings with key staff to ensure all current events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as; federal government stimulus check receipt, PPP loan fundings and the forgiveness application process, are managed appropriately.\nFinancial overview\nIn 2020, we recorded net income of $27.8 million, or $0.92 per fully diluted share, which compares with $39.5 million, or $1.30 per fully diluted share, in 2019, and $34.0 million, or $1.12 per fully diluted share, in 2018. Our basic earnings per share for the periods presented were $0.94 in 2020, $1.32 in 2019 and $1.14 in 2018. Our 2020 net income decreased primarily due to $10.4 million of provision for credit losses recorded in 2020, compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of $1.6 million in 2019 and $1.2 million in 2018. The increase in provision expense in 2020 was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions, and the adoption of the CECL methodology, which requires provision to be recorded based on future expected credit losses, as compared to the prior methodology of provision expense based on historically incurred losses. Net loan charge-offs were $979,000 in 2020 and $817,000 in 2019, compared to net loan recoveries of $317,000 in 2018. The reduction of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2020 also impacted our net interest income, which decreased $5.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, but increased $812,000 over 2018, due primarily to higher volumes on earning assets and decreases in the cost of funds. Our 2020 net income was favorably impacted by $10.0 million of growth in our residential mortgage banking revenues, compared to 2019, and $9.4 million of growth, compared to 2018. The low interest rate environment in 2020 resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan refinancing and new mortgage originations.\nNet interest and dividend income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, for 2020 compared to 2019. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $122.0 million, or 6.4%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Contributing to this growth was average PPP loans of $83.3 million in 2020, as well as organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate-investor loan portfolios. Offsetting our loan growth in 2020, compared to 2019, was an 88 basis point decrease in average rates earned on interest earning assets. Average interest bearing deposits increased $78.8 million, or 5.4%, for 2020 compared to 2019, while average deposit rates decreased 23 basis points over the same period. The decrease in rates was primarily due to the falling interest rate environment in 2020, due to the Federal Reserve rate reductions in March 2020, and deposit accounts repricing to the lower rates as the year progressed, which impacted all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $181.8 million, or 27.9%, from 2019 to 2020, as a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with federal stimulus funds received due to COVID-19 and the CARES Act, as well as growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate loans.\nNet interest and dividend income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, for 2019 compared to 2018. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $118.9 million, or 6.7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, resulting from organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Average interest bearing deposits decreased $17.1 million, or 1.2%, for 2019 compared to 2018, while average rates increased 12 basis points. This increase in rates was primarily due to the rising interest rate environment in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, which impacted interest rates on all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $41.6 million, or 6.8%, from 2018 to 2019, a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with growth in our commercial, leases and commercial real estate loans.\nWe continued to reposition our balance sheet in 2020 to provide appropriate funding for loan growth, ensure adequate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduce asset quality risk, and decrease our cost of funds through organic deposit growth. In 2020, our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased $11.5 million, compared to 2019, primarily from purchases in the fourth quarter of 2020 of short duration, high credit quality bonds, net of securities paydowns and calls, to utilize a portion of our excess liquidity on hand. In 2019, our available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $56.6 million, compared to 2018, primarily from sales in the third quarter of 2019 due to interest rate reductions and the tightening of credit spreads, which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease to interest income for 2019, compared to 2018. Net securities losses of $25,000 were recorded in 2020, compared to net securities gains of $4.5 million and $360,000 recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to sales and calls during those years. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $10.8 million, to $1.70 billion in 2020 from $1.69 billion in 2019, as funding needs in 2020 were also met by an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits year over year.\nManagement also continued to emphasize credit quality and maintained our capital ratios with continued strong liquidity. In 2020, we experienced loan growth of $104.0 million, or 5.4%, over 2019. The growth was driven by PPP loan originations, which totaled $74.1 million as of year end 2020, as well as an active commercial lending team in new and existing markets, and the continued development of a lease lending team. Asset quality levels have remained steady over the last few years in comparison to total loans, as nonperforming assets, increased to $25.5 million for 2020, compared to $20.9 million for 2019 and $23.5 million for 2018. We also continued to take steps to control operating expenses and increase net income. A decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.5 million in 2020 resulted in an increase of $228,000 in net other real estate owned expenses for 2020 compared to 2019, and a decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted in a minimal increase of $27,000 in the like period. As we focused on reducing all noninterest expenses, we were able to maintain our profitable wealth management business and secondary residential real estate originations and sales as important sources of noninterest income.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the banking industry. These policies require the reliance on estimates, assumptions and judgements, which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Therefore, we consider these policies, discussed below, to be critical accounting estimates and discuss them directly with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.\nSignificant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of the financial statements included in this annual report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Recent accounting pronouncements and standards that have impacted or could potentially affect us are also discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for credit losses\nDetermining the allowance for loan and lease losses has historically been identified as a critical accounting policy. On January 1, 2020, we adopted the new CECL accounting methodology which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for loan and lease losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses is also a critical accounting policy\u201d as:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>considerable judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Changes in Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of our Allowance for Credit Losses.\nAs a result of management's modeling, an allowance for credit losses on loans totaling $33.9 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020; in addition, an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $3.0 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020, within other liabilities. There was no allowance for credit losses on securities determined to be required per management's review at year end 2020. A provision for credit losses of $10.4 million was recorded in 2020, comprised of a $9.2 million provision for credit losses on loans and a $1.2 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, compared to $1.6 million and $1.2 million of loan and lease loss provision recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ACL is included in the Allowances for Credit Losses\u201d section below.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe use of fair values is required in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities, as well as for specific disclosures. Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.\nIn determining the fair value of financial instruments, market prices of the same or similar instruments are used whenever such prices are available. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. Fair value is estimated using modeling techniques and incorporates assumptions about interest rates, duration, prepayment speeds, risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. These assumptions are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which, among other topics addressed, required business entities to use the exit price notion, as defined in ASC 820, for the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Adoption of this standard resulted in our use of an exit price rather than an entrance price to determine the fair value of loans and deposits not already measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet disclosures. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements\u201d and Note 17 Fair Values of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements which include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used for further information regarding the valuation processes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis annual report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the presentation of net interest income and net interest income to interest earning assets on a tax equivalent ( TE\u201d) basis and our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (a) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of our operating performance, (b) enables a more complete understanding of factor and trends affecting our business, and (c) allows investors to evaluate our performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts, and bank regulators. Management uses non-GAAP measures as follows:\nin the preparation of our operating budgets, monthly financial performance reporting, and in our presentation to investors of our performance. However, we acknowledge that these non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below or alongside the first instance where each non-GAAP financial measure is used.\nResults of operations\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, which is our primary source of earnings, is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, as well as accretion income on purchased loans, and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends upon the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest-earning assets to total assets and of interest-bearing liabilities to total funding sources, and movements in market interest rates. Our net interest income can be significantly influenced by a variety of factors, including overall loan demand, economic conditions, credit risk, the amount of nonearning assets including nonperforming loans, the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice, variances in prepayment of loans and securities, early withdrawal of deposits, exercise of call options on borrowings or securities, a general rise or decline in interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield-curve, and balance sheet growth or contraction. Our asset and liability committee ( ALCO\u201d) seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring our balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions. This process is discussed in more detail in the section entitled Interest rate risk\u201d in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Rate Risk.\u201d\nOur net interest income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, to $91.8 million for 2020, from $96.8 million for 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in market interest rates on loans and securities, and was partially offset by decreases in interest rates on deposits and reductions in short and long-term borrowings. Our net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 3.43% for the year ended 2020, compared to 3.98% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, was 3.48% for the year ended 2020, compared to 4.06% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 58 basis points. Although average interest earning assets increased $241.3 million during 2020, the market rate reductions were more impactful than the volume growth of lower yielding assets. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to lower rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as a reduction of our short-term funding needs, as our excess liquidity on hand allowed us to utilize minimal short-term borrowings for the majority of 2020.\nOur net interest income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, to $96.8 million for 2019, from $90.9 million for 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by a full year impact of our acquisition of ABC Bank, and was partially offset by increases in interest expense. Our net interest margin was 3.98% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.87% for the year ended 2018, an increase of 11 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 4.06% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.96% for the year ended 2018, an increase of ten basis points. The growth in our net interest margin was due to higher loan volumes in 2019, coupled with $2.1 million of discount accretion on loans acquired in our ABC Bank acquisition in 2018 and Talmer branch purchase in late 2016. The increase in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to higher rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as additional short-term funding needs, which increased due to our loan growth and was financed by FHLBC borrowings, which reprice daily.\nOur average earning assets increased $241.3 million, or 9.9%, to $2.67 billion in 2020, from $2.43 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in our interest earning assets with financial institutions of $158.7 million stemming from federal stimulus funds received, as well as an increase in our loan portfolio, primarily due to PPP loans originated, in addition to organic commercial, lease financing, construction, and commercial real estate loan growth. Our average earning assets increased $81.5 million, or 3.5%, to $2.43 billion in 2019, from $2.35 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a full year of average impact of our April 2018 acquisition of ABC Bank, as well as organic commercial, lease financing, and commercial real estate loan growth.\nOur average interest bearing liabilities increased $10.8 million, or 0.6%, from $1.69 billion in 2019 to $1.70 billion in 2020, due primarily to an increase in all deposit categories, excluding time deposits. Deposit growth was driven by federal stimulus funds received by depositors, as well as growth in commercial deposit accounts stemming from new commercial loans. Our other short-term borrowings declined due to our excess liquidity on hand, while our average junior subordinated debentures decreased due to our March 2020 redemption of the Old Second Capital Trust I trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures totaling $32.6 million. Our average interest bearing liabilities decreased $17.3 million, or 1.0%, from $1.71 billion in 2018 to $1.69 billion in 2019, due primarily to a reduction in average NOW, money market, savings and time deposits, as well as growth in commercial demand deposit accounts commensurate with growth in our commercial loan clients, and a modest increase in short-term borrowings used to fund loan growth.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to our average consolidated balance sheets and reflects the yield on average interest earning assets and cost of average interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated obtained by dividing the related interest by the average balance of assets or liabilities. Average balances are derived from daily balances.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

2019 and 2018. See the discussion entitled Non-GAAP Presentations\u201d below and the table on page 43 that provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent.\n2 Interest income from loans is shown on a tax equivalent basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, discussed below, and includes fees of $4.3 million for 2020, and $1.1 million for both 2019 and 2018. Nonaccrual loans are included in the above stated average balances.\nFor purposes of discussion, net interest income and net interest income to interest earning assets have been adjusted to a non-GAAP tax equivalent ( TE\u201d) basis to more appropriately compare returns on tax-exempt loans and securities to other earning assets. The table below provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP (TE) measure to the GAAP equivalent:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of Tax Equivalent Adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 104,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 115,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 107,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable equivalent adjustment - loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable equivalent adjustment - securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (TE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: interest expense (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (TE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 93,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 93,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPP loan - interest and net fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (TE - excluding PPP loans)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 90,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 98,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 93,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 91,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 96,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 90,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest earning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,674,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,433,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,352,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average PPP loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 83,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest earning assets - excluding PPP loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,591,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,433,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,352,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest margin (TE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core net interest margin (TE - excluding PPP loans)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table allocates the changes in net interest income to changes in either average balances or average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

Rate variances are computed using the change in rate multiplied by the previous year's volume. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.\nProvision for credit losses\nWe recorded a provision for credit losses in 2020 of $10.4 million, comprised of $9.2 million related to loans and leases, and $1.2 million related to unfunded commitments, compared to $1.6 million in 2019 and $1.2 million in 2018.

This increase was due to growth in total residential mortgage banking revenues, primarily attributable to net gain on sales of mortgage loans. Originations of residential loans held-for-sale increased by 133.4 % in 2020 over 2019, and net gain on the sales of mortgage loans increased by over 200% year over year, due to the low market interest rates for the majority of 2020. Secondary mortgage service fees and mortgage servicing income also increased in 2020 compared to 2019. These positive variances were partially offset by growth in mark to market losses on mortgage servicing rights, which increased $1.3 million, or 50.2%, in 2020, compared to 2019. Service charges on deposits decreased $2.2 million, or 28.6%, and card-related income decreased $329,000, or 5.6%, in 2020, compared to 2019, as consumer spending was muted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had net losses on securities of $25,000 in 2020, primarily due to sales of $18.0 million, compared to a net gain of $4.5 million in 2019, due to portfolio sales of $191.3 million in 2019. Security sales in 2019 were executed to take advantage of the tightening credit spreads in the falling interest rate environment. Finally, BOLI death benefit proceeds of $57,000 were realized in 2020, compared to $872,000 of BOLI death benefit proceeds realized in 2019, and the increase in cash surrender value of BOLI declined by $182,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the 2019 like period.\nOur total noninterest income increased $4.4 million to $35.8 million in 2019, compared to $31.4 million in 2018. In 2019, we continued to implement our strategy to grow trust income and service charges on deposits, subject to applicable bank regulations. Trust income increased $238,000 in 2019 from 2018, due primarily to growth in agent fees, IRA management fees, and management emphasis on advisory fee growth. Average assets under management by our wealth management department totaled $1.21 billion for 2019, reflecting growth of $33.0 million, or 2.8%, from $1.18 billion for 2018. Service charges on deposits increased $387,000 in 2019 from 2018 due primarily to growth in commercial demand related account fees, as a result of increases in commercial demand deposit balances commensurate with management's focus on growing commercial loans. Residential mortgage banking revenue declined $589,000 in 2019 from 2018, due primarily to a rising interest rate environment in the first half of 2019 and the negative impact of the rate changes to mortgage servicing rights, which were partially offset by an increase of $30.8 million in mortgage loans originated for sale in 2019. Security gains, net, of $4.5 million were recorded in 2019, relating to security sales of $191.3 million, compared to security gains, net, of $360,000 in 2018 related to $94.7 million of securities sales in 2018. We recorded a death benefit of $872,000 on bank owned life insurance, or BOLI, in 2019, in addition to the $431,000 increase in cash surrender value of BOLI compared to 2018. Finally, other income decreased $215,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a decrease in interest rate swap fee income on commercial swaps.\nNoninterest expense\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Noninterest Expense for the Twelve Months ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change From\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 38,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Officers incentive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefits and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy, furniture and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Computer and data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 239.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General bank insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of core deposit intangible\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 81,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 79,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> N/M - Not meaningful\nOur total noninterest expense increased by $2.3 million, or 2.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, due primarily to an increase in salary costs as 2020 reflected a full year of the commercial lending team hires in mid-year 2019, annual merit increases in early 2020, growth in mortgage commissions paid due to an increase in residential loan origination volumes, higher employee insurance costs and an increase in company matches on 401k deferrals due to the earlier eligibility allowed to enter our 401k plan. In addition, occupancy, furniture and equipment expense increased $209,000 due to planned building repairs at various branch locations in 2020. FDIC insurance expense increased $421,000, due to assessment credits received in 2019 after the FDIC reached its required reserve ratio, that were not repeated in 2020; see Supervision and Regulation Deposit Insurance\u201d for further discussion of these assessment credits. Partially offsetting these increases to noninterest expense were reductions in computer and data processing, advertising expense, and other expense. Advertising expense decreased in 2020, as we continued to assess our marketing strategy and opportunities for future promotion of our 150th anniversary in 2021.\nOur total noninterest expense increased by $2.0 million, or 2.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a full year of costs related to our acquisition of ABC Bank in the second quarter of 2018, which increased salaries and employee benefits, and occupancy, furniture and equipment expense. In addition to the acquisition-related expense, as part of our strategic plan, we also made significant improvements, repairs and maintenance in 2019 on our various bank locations. Computer and data processing and legal fees decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, as the 2018 expenses included acquisition related costs. FDIC insurance expense decreased $477,000, or 73.0%, in 2019 from 2018 due to assessment credits received in 2019 after the FDIC reached its required reserve ratio. Amortization of core deposit intangibles increased $152,000, or 39.0%, in 2019, reflecting a full year of expense of the ABC Bank acquired deposit premium. Advertising expense decreased in 2019, as we began to assess our marketing strategy and opportunities for future promotion of our 150th anniversary in 2021. Our other real estate owned expenses, net, increased marginally by $27,000 due to continued low levels of other real estate held, and reductions in valuation reserves taken in 2019.\nOur number of full-time equivalent employees was 533 as of December 31, 2020, compared to 535 as of December 31, 2019 and 518 as of December 31, 2018. Staffing levels remained stable in 2020 as our team converted to primarily remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in staffing levels from 2018 to 2019 of 17 employees was primarily driven by growth in our specialty commercial lending teams in mid-year 2019 and our compliance team. Management continues to be diligent in controlling the hiring of additional personnel, even as positions become open, as we seek to efficiently utilize our current staff and control expenses.\nIncome taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense (benefit). An analysis of the provision for income taxes for the three years ended December 31, 2020, is detailed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements and our income tax accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur income tax expense totaled $9.6 million for 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $12.4 million for 2019 and $9.9 million for 2018. Income tax expense reflected all relevant statutory tax rates and GAAP accounting. Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for 2020, 23.9% for 2019, and 22.6% for 2018. Any changes in tax rates will be recorded in the period enacted.\nThe determination of whether we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, available tax planning strategies, and assessments of both current and future economic and business conditions. Management considered both positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to ultimately realize the deferred tax assets, which is largely dependent on our ability to derive benefits based on future taxable income. For all periods presented, management determined that the realization of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not\u201d as required by GAAP.\nFinancial condition\nGeneral\nOur total assets were $3.04 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $405.3 million, or 15.4%, from December 31, 2019. Our total cash and cash equivalents increased $279.3 million, driven by an increase in interest earning deposits with financial institutions, primarily due to stimulus payments our customers received from the federal government, as well as decreased consumer spending related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our loans increased by $104.0 million, or 5.4%, to $2.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. We experienced loan growth due to $136.7 million of PPP loan originations during 2020, $74.1 million of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we also had organic loan growth in 2020, primarily in our commercial, leases, construction and commercial real estate investor loan portfolios. Total securities increased by $11.5 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our portfolio mix remained static overall, but we were able to benefit from tight credit spreads and executed sales, primarily in the first quarter of 2020 just prior to the decline in interest rates, recording pretax net security losses of $25,000 in 2020. In 2020, management emphasized a desire for excess liquidity due to the unknown needs stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as short duration investments and credit quality in all investing and lending decisions. We also continued to experience a high level of competition for loans in our target markets. The balance of our other real estate owned decreased to $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020, from $5.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nOur total liabilities were $2.73 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $376.1 million, or 16.0%, from December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased by $410.3 million, or 19.3%, to $2.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to growth in commercial demand deposits commensurate with our commercial and commercial real estate loan growth. Management continued to fund new lending with deposit growth and securities sold under repurchase agreements, and we were able to reduce our short term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the FHLBC\u201d) due to our liquidity on hand.\nAt December 31, 2020, total stockholders' equity was $307.1 million, compared to $277.9 million at December 31, 2019.\nInvestments\nAs shown below, we experienced minimal changes in the overall composition of our securities portfolio from 2019 to 2020. However, the size of the portfolio increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in unrealized mark to market gains of $14.7 million in 2020.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale

Accordingly, the size and composition of the portfolio reflects our liquidity needs, loan demand and interest income objectives. We will adjust the size and composition of the portfolio from time to time. While a significant portion of the portfolio consists of readily marketable securities to address liquidity, other parts of the portfolio may reflect funds invested pending future loan demand or to maximize interest income without undue interest rate risk.\nOur total securities as of December 31, 2020, reflected a net increase of $11.5 million, or 2.4%, from December 31, 2019. We executed security sales in 2020 to take advantage of the tightening credit spreads in the declining interest rate environment, recording $18.0 million of sales in collateralized loan obligations, as well as recording $48.1 million of maturities, paydowns and calls primarily in states and political subdivisions and collateralized loan obligations. We recorded net securities losses of $25,000 in 2020 related to sales and calls during the year. We executed securities purchases in the latter half of 2020 to use a portion of our excess liquidity, with investments primarily in asset-backed securities.\nOur total securities as of December 31, 2019, reflected a net decrease of $56.6 million, or 10.5%, from December 31, 2018. We executed security sales in 2019 to take advantage of the tightening credit spreads in the falling interest rate environment, with the reduction occurring primarily in states and political subdivisions, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), and asset-backed securities. In addition, net paydowns and calls totaled $41.8 million in 2019, primarily due to the falling interest rate environment. We recorded net securities gains of $4.5 million in 2019 related to sales and calls during the year.\nSome of our holdings of U.S. government agency MBS and CMOs are issuances of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Some holdings of MBS and CMOs are issued by Ginnie Mae, which do carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. We also hold some MBS and CMOs that were not issued by U.S. government agencies and are typically credit-enhanced via over-collateralization and/or subordination. Holdings of ABS were largely comprised of securities backed by student loans issued under the U.S. Department of Education's ( DOE\u201d) FFEL program, which generally provides a minimum 97% U.S. DOE guarantee of principal. These ABS securities also have added credit enhancement through over-collateralization and/or subordination. The majority of holdings issued by states and political subdivisions are general obligation or revenue bonds that have S&P or Moody's ratings of AA- or higher. Other state and political subdivision issuances are unrated and generally consist of smaller investment amounts that involve issuers in our markets. The credit quality of these issuers is monitored and none have been identified as posing a material risk of loss. We also hold collateralized loan obligation ( CLOs\u201d) securities that are generally backed by a pool of debt issued by multiple middle-sized and large businesses. Our CLO S&P or Moody's ratings distribution consists of 58% rated A, 26% rated AA and 14% rated AAA. CLO credit enhancement is achieved through over-collateralization and/or subordination.\nThe following table presents the expected maturities or call dates and weighted average yield (nontax equivalent) of securities by major category as of December 31, 2020.

After the adoption of CECL, all PCD loans are now included within each relevant loan type and are not separately reported as PCI loans, because such loans are now included within the Company's nonperforming loan disclosures, if such loans otherwise meet the definition of a nonperforming loan.\nOur total loans were $2.03 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $104.0 million from $1.93 billion as of December 31, 2019. Growth in the year over year period was primarily due to PPP loan originations of $136.7 million, recorded within commercial loans, with $74.1 million of PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we experienced organic growth primarily in our commercial, leases, commercial real estate-investor and construction loan portfolios. Total loan originations and renewals of $1.11 billion were recorded in 2020, which were largely offset by accelerated paydowns experienced in 2020. We strive to serve customers in and around our geographic locations and continue to seek opportunities in our primary lending markets; however, our markets remain very competitive for new loan business.\nOur total loans were $1.93 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $33.8 million from $1.90 billion as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, we continued our focus on identifying commercial and industrial loan prospects that conform to our loan policies, and we increased commercial loans by $18.5 million, leases by $40.9 million, and commercial real estate-investor loans by $71.0 million, compared to 2018. Our loan growth in 2018 was driven by our ABC Bank acquisition of $227.6 million of loans, net of purchase accounting adjustments, as well as organic loan and lease financing growth and two HELOC purchases from a third party of $41.6 million.\nWe worked diligently to build loan origination pipelines in a competitive marketplace during the past four years, as evidenced by our loan growth of 5.4% in 2020, 1.8% in 2019, 17.3% in 2018 and 9.4% in 2017. Management continues to emphasize loan portfolio quality, which was evidenced by the stable nonperforming loan metrics discussed in the Asset Quality\u201d section below. As a result, we recorded net loan charge-offs of $979,000 in 2020, net loan charge-offs of $817,000 in 2019, and $317,000 of net loan recoveries in 2018.\nThe quality of our loan portfolio is in large part a reflection of the economic health of the communities in which we operate. Our local communities have been relatively stable in the past five years, as reflected in our loan growth and declines in classified assets, as discussed in the Asset Quality\u201d section below. Real estate lending categories comprised the largest group in the portfolio for all years presented. In addition, our lending exposure is diversified across our commercial, leasing, commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction loan, multifamily and HELOC portfolios, with total loan portfolio growth increasing in each of the five years presented. We remain committed to overseeing and managing our loan portfolio to avoid unnecessarily high credit concentrations in accordance with the general interagency guidance on risk management. Consistent with those commitments, management monitors our asset diversification and anticipates that the percentage of real estate lending in relation to the overall portfolio will decrease in the future.\nThe following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturities for loan categories at December 31, 2020:\nMaturity and Rate Sensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rate\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Through 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Floating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Floating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 185,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 120,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 74,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 407,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate -

We had no concentration of loans exceeding 10% of total loans that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans at December 31, 2020.\nOur ACL on loans was $33.9 million at year-end 2020, compared to $19.8 million at year-end 2019, and $19.0 million at year-end 2018. One measure of the adequacy of the ACL is the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans. The ACL as a percentage of total loans was 1.7% as of December 31, 2020 and 1.0% as of December 31, 2019. In management's judgment, an adequate allowance for estimated losses has been established; however, there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the estimated amounts in the future.\nCommercial real estate values have generally stabilized in the greater metro Chicago area with increased competition for the financing investor and multifamily transactions. While we continue to adhere to rigorous underwriting standards, we could experience increased levels of delinquencies, problem loans and losses in future periods if an economic recession or politically triggered economic instability develops.\nAsset Quality\nBeginning on January 1, 2020, we calculated our ACL using the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses, which includes a provision for losses on unfunded commitments, is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's assessment of expected losses over the expected life of the loan portfolio as well as considering changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nBefore January 1, 2020, we calculated an allowance for loan losses using the incurred losses methodology.\nBased on our portfolio composition at December 31, 2019, and the economic environment at that time, we recorded an overall increase in our ACL for loans and leases of $5.9 million and an ACL for unfunded commitments of $1.7 million as of January 1, 2020, the date we adopted CECL. Approximately $2.5 million of the increase to the ACL on loans resulted from the transfer of the non-accretable purchase accounting adjustments on purchased credit impaired loans. There was no impact from adoption of CECL on securities available-for sale. As a result of the adoption of CECL, we recorded a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $3.8 million, which was net of the $1.4 million deferred tax asset impact stemming from adoption.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $9.2 million of provision for credit losses on loans and $1.2 million of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, compared to $1.6 million of provision for loan and lease losses recorded for 2019, and $1.2 million for 2018. The increase in the provision for credit losses was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions, as our assumptions under the newly adopted CECL methodology, which requires a provision based on expected credit losses over the life of the loans, as compared to the previously used incurred loss model.\nNonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans, performing restructured accruing loans and loans 90 days or greater past due still accruing interest. Remediation work continues in all segments. Management believes that the full impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet known. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs appear to have delayed any materially adverse financial impact to the Bank. Once these stimulus programs have been exhausted, however, we believe our credit metrics could worsen and loan losses could ultimately materialize. Any potential loan losses will be contingent upon a number of factors beyond our control, such as the resurgence of the virus, including any new strains, offset by the potency of vaccines along with their extensive distribution, and the ability for customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routines.\nNonperforming loans increased by $7.2 million to $23.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $15.8 million at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets, which includes nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned, totaled $25.5 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $20.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Purchased credit deteriorated loans, or PCD loans, are purchased loans that, as of the date of acquisition, the Company determined had experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. As of the date of CECL adoption, $2.5 million of the credit related component of the purchase accounting adjustment on PCI loans was reclassified to the ACL upon reclassification to PCD status, which contributed to the $4.7 million increase in nonperforming assets since December 31, 2019. Credit metrics, excluding the impact of this reclassification, continue to be relatively stable regarding nonperforming loan levels, and management is carefully monitoring loans considered to be in a classified status. Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans increased to 1.1% as of December 31, 2020, from 0.8% as of December 31, 2019, and 0.9% December 31, 2018.

Refer to Note 4, Loans\u201d, in our consolidated financial statements, below, for further detail of past due loans by classification for 2020 and 2019.\nAccrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected in the current period is reversed against current period interest income. Interest income of approximately $70,000, $347,000 and $335,000 was recorded and collected during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on loans that subsequently went to nonaccrual status by year-end. Interest income, which would have been recognized during 2020, 2019 and 2018, had these loans been on an accrual basis throughout the year, was approximately $461,000, $1.3 million and $952,000, respectively. There were approximately $1.3 million and $4.5 million in restructured residential mortgage loans that were still accruing interest based upon their prior performance history at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the nonaccrual loans above include $2.7 million and $3.4 million in restructured loans for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nClassified Assets\nTable 112: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Classified assets as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change From\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 879.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate - Investor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate - Owner occupied\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate - Investor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate - Owner occupied\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HELOC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HELOC - Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total classified loans, excluding PCI loans2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total classified assets, excluding PCI loans2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI, net of purchase accounting adjustments2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total classified assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.7)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful\n1 The Other\u201d class includes consumer loans and overdrafts.\n2 In 2020, due to the adoption of CECL, PCD loans (formerly PCI loans) are now included in total classified loans, if their risk rating at period end so indicates. For all periods before 2020, PCI loans were not included within total classified loans since we were accreting interest income over the expected life of the loan.\nClassified loans include nonaccrual, performing troubled debt restructurings and all other loans considered substandard. Classified assets include both classified loans and OREO. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by either the current net worth and ability to meet payment obligations of the obligor, or by the collateral pledged to secure the loan, if any. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and carry the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if deficiencies remain uncorrected.\nTotal classified loans increased in 2020 compared to 2019 but decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in classified loans in 2020 was primarily attributable to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and the allocation of PCD loans, formerly PCI loans, to the appropriate segment classification if the risk rating so indicated. Total classified assets decreased in 2020 compared to both 2019 and 2018. Classified assets, which includes classified loans and OREO, was favorably impacted by a $2.5 million decrease in our OREO portfolio, in 2020 from 2019, and a $2.2 million decrease in our OREO portfolio in 2019 from 2018. Management monitors a metric of\nclassified assets to the sum of Bank Tier 1 capital and the ACL, which is referred to as the classified assets ratio.\u201d Our classified assets ratio increased to 12.64% at December 31, 2020, compared to 11.11% at December 31, 2019, from 13.49% at December 31, 2018.\nPotential Problem Loans\nWe utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. At the scheduled board of directors meetings of the Bank, loan listings are presented, which show significant loan relationships listed as Special Mention,\u201d Substandard,\u201d and Doubtful.\u201d Loans classified as Substandard include those that have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent as those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses that deserve management's close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention.\nManagement defines potential problem loans as performing loans rated Substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonperforming loan. These potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management. A more detailed description of these loans can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as listed in the credit quality indicators discussion.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nUpon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, (Day One), we recognized an increase in our ACL on outstanding loans of $5.9 million and an increase in our ACL on unfunded commitments of $1.7 million as a cumulative effect adjustment from change in accounting policies. Approximately $2.5 million of the increase to the ACL resulted from the transfer of the non-accretable purchase accounting adjustments on PCD loans. The Day One adjusting entries resulted in a $3.8 million reduction to retained earnings, and a deferred tax asset adjustment of $1.4 million. At December 31, 2020, the ACL on loans totaled $33.9 million, and the ACL on unfunded commitments, included in other liabilities, totaled $3.0 million, compared to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $19.8 million as of December 31, 2019, under the incurred loss model, with no allowance for unfunded commitments.

In addition, the OCC, as part of their examination process, periodically reviews the ACL. Regulators can require management to record adjustments to the allowance level based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of examination. The OCC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted an interagency policy statement on the ACL. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that (1) institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; (2) management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and (3) management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Management believes it has established an adequate estimated allowance for expected credit losses over the estimated life of our loan portfolio. Management reviews its process quarterly using an extensive and detailed loan review process, makes changes as needed, and reports those results at meetings of our Board of Directors and Audit Committee. Although management believes the ACL is sufficient to cover expected losses over the estimated life of our loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses or that regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, would not request us to materially adjust our ACL at the time of their examination.\nBased on these quarterly assessments, management determined that a provision for credit losses on loans of $9.2 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million was required for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. When measured as a percentage of average loans outstanding, the total ACL decreased from 1.1% of total loans as of December 31, 2018, to 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2019, but increased to 1.7% of total loans at December 31, 2020.\nThe provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments totaled $1.2 million in 2020, and the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Management reviewed the securities portfolio for credit loss exposure, and determined that no allowance for credit losses on securities was required for 2020. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on the ACL for securities analysis performed.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) decreased to $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $5.0 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting a $2.5 million decline. Of the 11 properties we held as of year-end 2020, the largest net book value property was comprised of one industrial zoned property carried at $576,000. Reductions in our OREO balance during 2020 included the sale of twelve properties resulting in proceeds of $3.0 million. Net gains on the sale of OREO properties during 2020 totaled $204,000,\ncompared to net gains on sale of $264,000 in 2019 and $792,000 in 2018. The trend of year over year reductions in valuation adjustments continued but at decreasing levels in 2018 through 2020.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>OREO Properties by Type as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change From\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single family residence\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots (single family and commercial)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 758.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (91.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.9)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total OREO properties\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther real estate assets acquired in settlement of loans are recorded at the fair value of the property when acquired, less estimated costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis.

This compares to $6.7 million, or 57.3%, of gross OREO, net of participations, at year-end 2019.\nDeposits\nWe grew total deposits by $410.3 million, or 19.3%, to a total of $2.54 billion at year-end 2020 compared to year-end 2019 primarily due to the federal stimulus funds received by our customers from the U.S. government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Total deposits grew by $10.1 million, or 0.5%, from $2.12 billion at year-end 2018 to $2.13 billion at year-end 2019. We had no brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2020, compared to $249,000 in brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2019, due to scheduled runoff of brokered deposits acquired with the ABC Bank acquisition.\nYTD Average Balances and Interest Rates\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 832,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 650,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 608,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOW and money market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 752,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 721,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 743,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 308,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 424,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 431,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 443,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,373,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,112,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,087,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the amounts and maturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31 of the year indicated:\nMaturities of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 88,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 54,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 months through 6 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 months through 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 225,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 214,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nIn addition to deposits, we used other liquidity sources for our funding needs in 2020, such as repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings with the FHLBC. Our borrowings at the FHLBC require the Bank to be a member and invest in the stock of the FHLBC, and total borrowings are generally limited to the lower of 35% of total assets or 60% of the book value of certain mortgage-backed loans. We primarily use these borrowings as a source of short-term funding; however, our excess liquidity on hand during 2020 allowed us to reduce our short-term borrowing levels with the FHLBC throughout the majority of the year. Our other short-term borrowings decreased by $48.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, with no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2020.\nWe recorded long-term FHLBC borrowings in our ABC Bank acquisition in April 2018 of $23.4 million, net of purchase accounting adjustments. These borrowings were issued at favorable rates compared to the overnight borrowing rate as of the date of ABC Bank acquisition, and matured over a seven year period. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of these borrowings consists of one remaining advance in long-term status which totaled $6.4 million and matures in February 2026. In addition, we have an unused line of credit of $20.0 million available with a third-party bank, which can be used for the Company's operating needs at the holding company level. This line of credit renews every February and must be repaid within 360 days, if drawn. This line of credit had an outstanding balance of $4.0 million as of year-end 2018, but was repaid in January 2019 and has not been used since that time.\nShort-term and Long-term Borrowings\nTable

borrowings are stated rates per contract, and do not include adjustments for deferred issuance costs.\nThere were no other categories of short-term borrowings that had an average balance greater than 30% of our stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nThe average junior subordinated debentures included two issuances of trust preferred securities by our subsidiaries, Old Second Capital Trust I ( Trust I\u201d) which totaled $32.0 million as of December 31, 2019, and Old Second Capital Trust II ( Trust II\u201d), which totaled $25.0 million as of December 31, 2019. On March 2, 2020, we redeemed all of the subordinated debentures due June 30, 2033, relating to the outstanding 7.80% cumulative trust preferred securities (the Trust Securities\u201d) issued by Trust I. Also on March 2, 2020, we redeemed all of the outstanding Trust Securities at a redemption price of $10.00 per Trust Security, which reflects 100% of the liquidation amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. In connection with the redemption, the Trust Securities were delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements Junior Subordinated Debentures for further discussion of the Capital Trusts I and II. The junior subordinated debentures outstanding at December 31, 2020 consists of $25.8 million of the Trust II issuance.\nIn December 2016, we completed the retirement of $45.0 million of subordinated debt with the proceeds of a $45.0 million senior notes issuance and cash on hand. The senior notes mature in ten years, and terms include interest payable semiannually at 5.75% for five years. Beginning December 31, 2021, the senior debt will pay interest at a floating rate, with interest payable quarterly at three month LIBOR plus 385 basis points. As of December 31, 2020, we had $44.4 million of senior debt outstanding, net of deferred issuance costs. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained within the senior debt agreement.\nCapital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total stockholders' equity of $307.1 million, an increase of $29.2 million, or 10.5%, from $277.9 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to net income of $27.8 million in 2020, and a favorable fair value adjustment on securities available for sale, within accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2020, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, was $14.8 million, compared to $4.6 million accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of year-end 2019. Equity in 2020 was reduced for the payment of dividends to common stockholders, which totaled $1.2 million for the year, as well as treasury stock purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase plan, which totaled $5.5 million for the year. Our total stockholders' equity increased in 2019, ending at $277.9 million, compared to $229.1 million at year end 2018, due primarily to net income of $39.5 million in 2019.\nWe issued $32.6 million of cumulative trust preferred securities through our consolidated subsidiary, Trust I, in July 2003. As noted above, we redeemed all of the outstanding Trust Securities on March 2, 2020, at a redemption price of $10.00 per Trust Security, which reflects 100% of the liquidation amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date.\nWe issued an additional $25.8 million of cumulative trust preferred securities through a private placement completed by a second unconsolidated subsidiary, Trust II, in April 2007. These trust preferred securities mature in 30 years, but subject to regulatory approval, can also now be called in whole or in part. The quarterly cash distributions on the securities were fixed at 6.77% through June 15, 2017, and converted to a floating rate at 150 basis points over the three-month LIBOR rate thereafter. We entered into a forward starting interest rate swap on August 18, 2015, with an effective date of June 15, 2017. This transaction had a notional amount totaling $25.8 million as of December 31, 2015, and was designated as a cash flow hedge of certain junior subordinated debentures and continues to be fully effective during the period presented. As such, no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swap is recorded in other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount included in other comprehensive income would be reclassified to current earnings should all or a portion of the hedge no longer be considered effective. We expect the hedge to remain fully effective during the remaining term of the swap. We will pay the counterparty a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on three month LIBOR. Management concluded that it would be advantageous to enter into this transaction given that our trust preferred securities issued in 2007 changed from a fixed to floating rate on June 15, 2017. The cash flow hedge has a maturity date of June 15, 2037.\nWe are currently paying interest on the Trust II preferred securities as that interest comes due. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, total trust preferred proceeds of $25.0 million and $56.6 million, respectively, qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital at the bank holding company level.\nIn January 2009, we issued and sold (i) 73,000 shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the Series B Stock\u201d) and (ii) a warrant to purchase 815,339 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $13.43 per share to the U.S. Treasury. The total liquidation value of the Series B Stock and the warrant was $73.0 million at issuance. As of December 31, 2015, the Series B Stock was fully redeemed. The warrant had a carrying value of $4.8 million and was included within additional paid-in capital as of December 31, 2018. On January 16, 2019, the warrant was fully exercised; see further disclosures in Note 12 - Earnings Per Share, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we were authorized to repurchase up to approximately 1.5 million shares (or approximately 5%) of our outstanding common stock through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means. The stock repurchase program expired on September 19, 2020; however, we received a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to extend the previously authorized stock repurchase program through October 20, 2021. The actual means and timing of any repurchases, quantity of purchased shares and prices will be, subject to certain limitations, at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, market prices of our common stock, general market and economic condition, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These share purchases are anticipated to be funded by our cash on hand. No shares were repurchased in 2019, and during 2020, we repurchased 719,273 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $7.65 per share pursuant to our stock repurchase program. 775,553 shares remain available to be repurchased under the plan as of December 31, 2020.\nWe withheld 33,765 shares for $423,000 to satisfy RSU vesting tax withholding obligations in 2020, and repurchased 719,273 shares for $5.5 million under our stock repurchase program, which increased treasury stock. This increase was offset by issuances of 46,325 shares for RSU vestings, which totaled $431,000. The net impact was an increase to treasury stock of 706,713 shares, to 5,628,661 shares totaling $101.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase in treasury stock decreased stockholders' equity, and also increased earnings per share by decreasing the number of shares outstanding.\nWe withheld 49,959 shares for $667,000 to satisfy stock award tax withholding obligations in 2019, which increased treasury stock. This increase was offset by issuances of 38,614 shares for nonqualified stock option exercises and RSU vestings, which totaled $526,000, and the exercise of stock warrants of 45,836 shares, which totaled $313,000. The net impact was a reduction to treasury stock of 34,491 shares, to 4,921,948 shares totaling $95.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in treasury stock increased stockholders'\nequity, and also decreased earnings per share by increasing the number of shares outstanding. There were 4,500 stock options exercised in 2019 and in 2018; no stock options remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or 2020.\nRegulatory capital rules adopted in July 2013 and fully-phased in as of January 1, 2019, which we refer to as the Basel III rules, impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies other than small bank holding companies\u201d which are generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer\u201d on top of our minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of CET1, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer consists of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nThe following table shows the regulatory capital ratios and the current minimum and well capitalized regulatory requirements at the dates indicated:\nRisk Based Capital Ratios\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minimum Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Well Capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adequacy with\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under Prompt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital Conservation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corrective Action\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Buffer, if applicable1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provisions2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.08\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Bank\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Amounts are shown inclusive of a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%. Under the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is not subject to the minimum capital adequacy and capital conservation buffer capital requirements at the holding company level, unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve (such capital requirements are applicable only at the Bank level). Although the minimum regulatory capital requirements are not applicable to the Company or the Tier 1 Leverage ratio, we calculate these ratios for our own planning and monitoring purposes.\n2 Prompt corrective action provisions are only applicable at the Bank level.\nThe Company, on a consolidated basis, exceeded the minimum capital ratios to be deemed well capitalized\u201d at December 31, 2020, pursuant to the capital requirements in effect at that time. All ratios conform to the regulatory calculation requirements in effect as of the date noted.\nIn addition to the above regulatory ratios, our common equity to total assets ratio decreased from 10.54% to 10.10%, while our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP), decreased from 9.83% at December 31, 2019 to 9.49% at December 31, 2020. The declines in these ratios was primarily due to an increase in each denominator due to growth in assets in 2020, due to interest earning deposits with financial institutions and loans, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Management considers this non-GAAP measure a valuable performance measurement for capital analysis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio to the non-GAAP ratio for the periods indicated:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity\n</td> <td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 307,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 307,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 277,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 277,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Limitation of exclusion of core deposit intangible (80%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 286,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 286,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 256,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 257,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,040,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,040,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,635,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,635,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Adjusted goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,020,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,020,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,614,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,614,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity to tangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe non-GAAP intangible asset exclusion reflects the 80% core deposit limitation per Basel III guidelines within risk based capital calculations, and is useful for the Company when reviewing risk based capital ratios and equity performance metrics.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is our ability to fund operations, to meet depositor withdrawals, to provide for customer's credit needs, and to meet maturing obligations and existing commitments. Our liquidity principally depends on cash flows from net operating activities, including pledging requirements, investment in, and both maturity and repayment of assets, changes in balances of deposits and borrowings, and our ability to borrow funds. In addition, the Company's liquidity depends on the Bank's ability to pay dividends, which is subject to certain regulatory requirements. See Supervision and Regulation\u00ad Dividend Payments.\u201d We continually monitor our cash position and borrowing capacity as well as perform stress tests of contingency funding no less frequently than quarterly as part of our liquidity management process. Stress testing of liquidity for contingency funding purposes includes tests that outline scenarios for specifically identified liquidity risk events, which are then aggregated into a Bank-wide assessment of liquidity risk stress levels. The outcomes of these tests are reviewed by management monthly and our Board of Directors quarterly. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020 totaled $329.9 million, compared to $50.6 million as of December 31, 2019, and $55.2 million as of December 31, 2018.\nNet cash inflows from operating activities were $26.0 million during 2020, compared with inflows of $52.6 million in 2019 and inflows of $54.9 million in 2018. Proceeds from sales of loans held-for-sale, net of funds used to originate loans held-for-sale, was a source of inflows for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Interest received, net of interest paid, combined with changes in other assets and liabilities were a source of outflows in 2020, and inflows in 2019 and 2018. Management of investing and financing activities, as well as market conditions, determines the level and the stability of net interest cash flows in 2020. Management's policy is to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates to the extent possible as part of our balance sheet management process.\nNet cash outflows from investing activities were $103.8 million in 2020, compared to $42.2 million of inflows in 2019, and $25.8 million of outflows in 2018. Loan growth resulted in $103.9 million of cash outflows for 2020, compared to $34.4 million of cash outflows in 2019 and $52.7 million of cash outflows in 2018. In 2020, securities transactions accounted for net inflows of $831,000, and proceeds from the sales of OREO assets accounted for inflows of $3.3 million. In 2019, securities transactions accounted for net inflows of $77.0 million, whereas proceeds from the sale of OREO assets accounted for inflows of $2.8 million. The ABC Bank acquisition in April 2018 resulted in net cash outflows of $35.7 million in 2018.\nNet cash inflows from financing activities in 2020 were $357.1 million, primarily due to deposit growth, compared to net cash outflows for financing activities of $99.5 million in 2019, and net cash outflows of $29.7 million in 2018. Significant cash outflows from financing activities in 2020 also included a reduction in other short-term borrowings of $48.5 million, and redemption of the OSBC Capital Trust I junior subordinated debentures of $32.6 million. Significant cash outflows from financing activities in 2019 included decreases of $101.0 million in other short-term borrowings with the FHLBC and the US Bank line of credit payoff. Significant cash outflows in 2018 included deposit run-off associated with the ABC Bank acquisition in 2018, primarily related to non-core deposits.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various financial obligations that may require future cash payments.

The purchase obligation amounts presented above primarily relate to certain contractual payments for services provided for information technology, capital expenditures, and the outsourcing of certain operational activities. We routinely enter into contracts for services. These contracts may require payment for services to be provided in the future and may also contain penalty clauses for early termination. In this disclosure, we have made an effort to estimate such payments, where applicable. Additionally, where necessary, all data reflects reasonable management estimates as to certain purchase obligations as of December 31, 2020. Management has used the information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related purchase obligations.\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-balance sheet arrangements\nDerivative contracts, which include contracts under which we either receive cash from, or pay cash to, counterparties reflecting changes in interest rates are carried at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as disclosed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provided in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. Because the fair value of derivative contracts changes daily as market interest rates change, the derivative assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020, do not necessarily represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid. As a result, these assets and liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above.\nAssets under management and assets under custody are held in fiduciary or custodial capacity for clients. In accordance with GAAP, these assets are not included on our balance sheet.\nFinancial instruments with off-balance sheet risk address the financing needs of our clients.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and financial condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report.\nBusiness overview\nWe provide a wide range of financial services through our 29 banking locations located in Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle and Will counties in Illinois. These banking centers offer access to a full range of traditional retail and commercial banking services including treasury management operations as well as fiduciary and wealth management services. We focus our business on establishing and maintaining relationships with our clients while maintaining a commitment to providing for the financial services needs of the communities in which we operate through our retail branch network. We emphasize relationships with individual customers as well as small to medium-sized businesses throughout our market area. Our market area includes a mix of commercial and industrial, real estate, and consumer related lending opportunities, and provides a stable, loyal core deposit base. We also offer extensive wealth management services, which include a registered investment advisory platform in addition to trust administration and trust services related to personal and corporate trusts, including employee benefit plan administration services.\nOur primary deposit products are checking, NOW, money market, savings, and certificate of deposit accounts, and our primary lending products are commercial mortgages, leases, construction lending, commercial loans, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. Many of our loans are secured by various forms of collateral including real estate, business assets, and consumer property although borrower cash flow is the primary source of repayment at the time of loan origination.\nOn April 20, 2018, we closed on our acquisition of Greater Chicago Financial Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABC Bank. As a result of this transaction, we acquired $227.6 million of loans, net of fair value adjustments, and $248.5 million of deposits, net of fair value adjustments. The purchase resulted in us increasing our presence in the near west Chicago area and metropolitan Chicago, as four branches were acquired with a retail and commercial client mix of loans and deposits.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. Federal and state governments have taken, and may continue to take, unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed and businesses and schools have reopened with some level of success, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly, which may cause a freezing or, in certain\ncases, a reversal of previously announced relaxation of activity restrictions and may prompt the need for additional aid and other forms of relief.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, adversely affecting many of our clients. The unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market interest rates have declined significantly, with the 10-year Treasury bond falling below 1.00% on March 3, 2020, for the first time, although bond yields have recently begun to rise, nearing where they were before the pandemic in February 2020. In March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the targeted federal funds interest rate range to 0% to 0.25% percent. These reductions in interest rates and the other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, possibly materially, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, the pandemic has had negative effects on our interest income, ACL, and certain transaction-based line items of noninterest income. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including the effect of governmental and private sector initiatives, the effect of the recent rollout of vaccinations for the virus, whether such vaccinations will be effective against any resurgence of the virus, including any new strain, and the ability for customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routine.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to protect our employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, as part of our efforts to exercise social distancing, we closed all of our banking lobbies (other than by appointment) and conducted most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. At this time, our lobbies have been reopened, but we encourage customers to use drive-thru or electronic means to conduct their banking, and are following social distancing and personal protective protocols as directed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, a majority of our workforce has been working from home since mid-March 2020, and we expect this to continue through at least the first quarter of 2021, or until vaccines are more widely available.\nResults of Operation and Financial Condition\nWe are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operation and financial condition. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly impacted the health of the overall real estate industry in our markets, which have reflected relative stability over the past three years. In addition, we have not experienced significant incurred losses on loans or received communications from our borrowers that significant losses were imminent. While management does not currently expect the next year to result in the precipitous decline in the value of certain real estate assets similar to the declines seen in 2009 to 2010, our forecast includes assumptions for certain loss scenarios that may occur due to the exhaustion of federal stimulus funds or a decrease in market valuations. Accordingly, in 2020, we determined it prudent to increase our provision for credit losses in anticipation of continued market risk and uncertainty at this time. Our provision for credit losses was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was unchanged from the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Our allowance for credit losses increased $14.1 million during 2020, which was impacted by both our adoption of the new CECL methodology and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions. Although we did not record additional provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, as periods ending after December 31, 2020 may also be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also adjust our investment securities portfolio to fair value each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold as well as experience reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $18.6 million of goodwill. As of March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2020, we considered whether a quantitative assessment of our goodwill was required because of the significant economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately determined that a quantitative assessment was not required at those period ends. At November 30, 2020, we performed our recurring annual review for any goodwill impairment. At the end of each of these periods, we determined no goodwill impairment existed. However, further delayed recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy, financial markets, and the associated impacts on our customers, employees and vendors, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLending Operations and Accommodations to Borrowers\nTo more fully support our customers during the pandemic, we established client assistance programs, including offering commercial, consumer, and mortgage loan payment deferrals for certain clients. During 2020, we executed 499 of these deferrals on loan balances of $231.3 million. In accordance with interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short term deferrals were not considered troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2020, 448 loans previously in deferral status, representing loan balances of $198.6 million, had resumed payments or paid off, and 51 loans totaling $32.7 million remained in active deferral status, of which only $4.4 million were in\nnonaccrual status. We also suspended late fees for consumer loans through June 30, 2020, and, although consumer late fees have been reinstated, we will continue to evaluate any late fee suspension based on the borrower's financial situation and prior payment history. In addition, we paused new foreclosure and repossession actions through December 31, 2020, and will continue to re-evaluate these activities based on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nWe are also participating in the CARES Act. During 2020, as part of the first round\u201d of the SBA PPP program, we processed 746 PPP loan applications, representing a total of $136.7 million. In early October, we started the application process for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect this process to continue through the first quarter of 2021, with funds to be received from the SBA for the forgiven loans well into the second quarter of 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had originated two loans for $305,000 under the Main Street Lending Program. We recorded $2.4 million of net fee income on PPP loans in 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, unearned net fee income on PPP loans totaled $420,000. Finally, with the governmental authorization of the second round\u201d of the SBA PPP in late 2020, we are now originating additional PPP loans, and anticipate filing for forgiveness of these loans with the SBA in the latter half of 2021.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by credit losses.\nWe believe there could be potential stresses on liquidity management as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, as customers manage their own liquidity stress, we could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of credit.\nWe have developed new processes to monitor our liquidity on a daily basis, and have run stress testing based on various economic assumptions under stress and severe stress scenarios. In addition, management continues to communicate each week in structured meetings with key staff to ensure all current events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as; federal government stimulus check receipt, PPP loan fundings and the forgiveness application process, are managed appropriately.\nFinancial overview\nIn 2020, we recorded net income of $27.8 million, or $0.92 per fully diluted share, which compares with $39.5 million, or $1.30 per fully diluted share, in 2019, and $34.0 million, or $1.12 per fully diluted share, in 2018. Our basic earnings per share for the periods presented were $0.94 in 2020, $1.32 in 2019 and $1.14 in 2018. Our 2020 net income decreased primarily due to $10.4 million of provision for credit losses recorded in 2020, compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of $1.6 million in 2019 and $1.2 million in 2018. The increase in provision expense in 2020 was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions, and the adoption of the CECL methodology, which requires provision to be recorded based on future expected credit losses, as compared to the prior methodology of provision expense based on historically incurred losses. Net loan charge-offs were $979,000 in 2020 and $817,000 in 2019, compared to net loan recoveries of $317,000 in 2018. The reduction of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2020 also impacted our net interest income, which decreased $5.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, but increased $812,000 over 2018, due primarily to higher volumes on earning assets and decreases in the cost of funds. Our 2020 net income was favorably impacted by $10.0 million of growth in our residential mortgage banking revenues, compared to 2019, and $9.4 million of growth, compared to 2018. The low interest rate environment in 2020 resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan refinancing and new mortgage originations.\nNet interest and dividend income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, for 2020 compared to 2019. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $122.0 million, or 6.4%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Contributing to this growth was average PPP loans of $83.3 million in 2020, as well as organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate-investor loan portfolios. Offsetting our loan growth in 2020, compared to 2019, was an 88 basis point decrease in average rates earned on interest earning assets. Average interest bearing deposits increased $78.8 million, or 5.4%, for 2020 compared to 2019, while average deposit rates decreased 23 basis points over the same period. The decrease in rates was primarily due to the falling interest rate environment in 2020, due to the Federal Reserve rate reductions in March 2020, and deposit accounts repricing to the lower rates as the year progressed, which impacted all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $181.8 million, or 27.9%, from 2019 to 2020, as a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with federal stimulus funds received due to COVID-19 and the CARES Act, as well as growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate loans.\nNet interest and dividend income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, for 2019 compared to 2018. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $118.9 million, or 6.7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, resulting from organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Average interest bearing deposits decreased $17.1 million, or 1.2%, for 2019 compared to 2018, while average rates increased 12 basis points. This increase in rates was primarily due to the rising interest rate environment in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, which impacted interest rates on all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $41.6 million, or 6.8%, from 2018 to 2019, a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with growth in our commercial, leases and commercial real estate loans.\nWe continued to reposition our balance sheet in 2020 to provide appropriate funding for loan growth, ensure adequate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduce asset quality risk, and decrease our cost of funds through organic deposit growth. In 2020, our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased $11.5 million, compared to 2019, primarily from purchases in the fourth quarter of 2020 of short duration, high credit quality bonds, net of securities paydowns and calls, to utilize a portion of our excess liquidity on hand. In 2019, our available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $56.6 million, compared to 2018, primarily from sales in the third quarter of 2019 due to interest rate reductions and the tightening of credit spreads, which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease to interest income for 2019, compared to 2018. Net securities losses of $25,000 were recorded in 2020, compared to net securities gains of $4.5 million and $360,000 recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to sales and calls during those years. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $10.8 million, to $1.70 billion in 2020 from $1.69 billion in 2019, as funding needs in 2020 were also met by an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits year over year.\nManagement also continued to emphasize credit quality and maintained our capital ratios with continued strong liquidity. In 2020, we experienced loan growth of $104.0 million, or 5.4%, over 2019. The growth was driven by PPP loan originations, which totaled $74.1 million as of year end 2020, as well as an active commercial lending team in new and existing markets, and the continued development of a lease lending team. Asset quality levels have remained steady over the last few years in comparison to total loans, as nonperforming assets, increased to $25.5 million for 2020, compared to $20.9 million for 2019 and $23.5 million for 2018. We also continued to take steps to control operating expenses and increase net income. A decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.5 million in 2020 resulted in an increase of $228,000 in net other real estate owned expenses for 2020 compared to 2019, and a decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted in a minimal increase of $27,000 in the like period. As we focused on reducing all noninterest expenses, we were able to maintain our profitable wealth management business and secondary residential real estate originations and sales as important sources of noninterest income.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the banking industry. These policies require the reliance on estimates, assumptions and judgements, which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Therefore, we consider these policies, discussed below, to be critical accounting estimates and discuss them directly with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.\nSignificant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of the financial statements included in this annual report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Recent accounting pronouncements and standards that have impacted or could potentially affect us are also discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for credit losses\nDetermining the allowance for loan and lease losses has historically been identified as a critical accounting policy. On January 1, 2020, we adopted the new CECL accounting methodology which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for loan and lease losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses is also a critical accounting policy\u201d as:\n \u25cf changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; \n \u25cf estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; and \n \u25cf the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and \n \u25cf considerable judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. \nBecause our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Changes in Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of our Allowance for Credit Losses.\nAs a result of management's modeling, an allowance for credit losses on loans totaling $33.9 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020; in addition, an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $3.0 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020, within other liabilities. There was no allowance for credit losses on securities determined to be required per management's review at year end 2020. A provision for credit losses of $10.4 million was recorded in 2020, comprised of a $9.2 million provision for credit losses on loans and a $1.2 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, compared to $1.6 million and $1.2 million of loan and lease loss provision recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ACL is included in the Allowances for Credit Losses\u201d section below.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe use of fair values is required in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities, as well as for specific disclosures. Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.\nIn determining the fair value of financial instruments, market prices of the same or similar instruments are used whenever such prices are available. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. Fair value is estimated using modeling techniques and incorporates assumptions about interest rates, duration, prepayment speeds, risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. These assumptions are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which, among other topics addressed, required business entities to use the exit price notion, as defined in ASC 820, for the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Adoption of this standard resulted in our use of an exit price rather than an entrance price to determine the fair value of loans and deposits not already measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet disclosures. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements\u201d and Note 17 Fair Values of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements which include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used for further information regarding the valuation processes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis annual report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the presentation of net interest income and net interest income to interest earning assets on a tax equivalent ( TE\u201d) basis and our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (a) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of our operating performance, (b) enables a more complete understanding of factor and trends affecting our business, and (c) allows investors to evaluate our performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts, and bank regulators. Management uses non-GAAP measures as follows:\nin the preparation of our operating budgets, monthly financial performance reporting, and in our presentation to investors of our performance. However, we acknowledge that these non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below or alongside the first instance where each non-GAAP financial measure is used.\nResults of operations\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, which is our primary source of earnings, is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, as well as accretion income on purchased loans, and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends upon the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest-earning assets to total assets and of interest-bearing liabilities to total funding sources, and movements in market interest rates. Our net interest income can be significantly influenced by a variety of factors, including overall loan demand, economic conditions, credit risk, the amount of nonearning assets including nonperforming loans, the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice, variances in prepayment of loans and securities, early withdrawal of deposits, exercise of call options on borrowings or securities, a general rise or decline in interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield-curve, and balance sheet growth or contraction. Our asset and liability committee ( ALCO\u201d) seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring our balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions. This process is discussed in more detail in the section entitled Interest rate risk\u201d in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Rate Risk.\u201d\nOur net interest income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, to $91.8 million for 2020, from $96.8 million for 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in market interest rates on loans and securities, and was partially offset by decreases in interest rates on deposits and reductions in short and long-term borrowings. Our net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 3.43% for the year ended 2020, compared to 3.98% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, was 3.48% for the year ended 2020, compared to 4.06% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 58 basis points. Although average interest earning assets increased $241.3 million during 2020, the market rate reductions were more impactful than the volume growth of lower yielding assets. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to lower rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as a reduction of our short-term funding needs, as our excess liquidity on hand allowed us to utilize minimal short-term borrowings for the majority of 2020.\nOur net interest income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, to $96.8 million for 2019, from $90.9 million for 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by a full year impact of our acquisition of ABC Bank, and was partially offset by increases in interest expense. Our net interest margin was 3.98% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.87% for the year ended 2018, an increase of 11 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 4.06% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.96% for the year ended 2018, an increase of ten basis points. The growth in our net interest margin was due to higher loan volumes in 2019, coupled with $2.1 million of discount accretion on loans acquired in our ABC Bank acquisition in 2018 and Talmer branch purchase in late 2016. The increase in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to higher rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as additional short-term funding needs, which increased due to our loan growth and was financed by FHLBC borrowings, which reprice daily.\nOur average earning assets increased", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and financial condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report.\nBusiness overview\nWe provide a wide range of financial services through our 29 banking locations located in Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle and Will counties in Illinois. These banking centers offer access to a full range of traditional retail and commercial banking services including treasury management operations as well as fiduciary and wealth management services. We focus our business on establishing and maintaining relationships with our clients while maintaining a commitment to providing for the financial services needs of the communities in which we operate through our retail branch network. We emphasize relationships with individual customers as well as small to medium-sized businesses throughout our market area. Our market area includes a mix of commercial and industrial, real estate, and consumer related lending opportunities, and provides a stable, loyal core deposit base. We also offer extensive wealth management services, which include a registered investment advisory platform in addition to trust administration and trust services related to personal and corporate trusts, including employee benefit plan administration services.\nOur primary deposit products are checking, NOW, money market, savings, and certificate of deposit accounts, and our primary lending products are commercial mortgages, leases, construction lending, commercial loans, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. Many of our loans are secured by various forms of collateral including real estate, business assets, and consumer property although borrower cash flow is the primary source of repayment at the time of loan origination.\nOn April 20, 2018, we closed on our acquisition of Greater Chicago Financial Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABC Bank. As a result of this transaction, we acquired $227.6 million of loans, net of fair value adjustments, and $248.5 million of deposits, net of fair value adjustments. The purchase resulted in us increasing our presence in the near west Chicago area and metropolitan Chicago, as four branches were acquired with a retail and commercial client mix of loans and deposits.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. Federal and state governments have taken, and may continue to take, unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed and businesses and schools have reopened with some level of success, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly, which may cause a freezing or, in certain\ncases, a reversal of previously announced relaxation of activity restrictions and may prompt the need for additional aid and other forms of relief.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, adversely affecting many of our clients. The unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market interest rates have declined significantly, with the 10-year Treasury bond falling below 1.00% on March 3, 2020, for the first time, although bond yields have recently begun to rise, nearing where they were before the pandemic in February 2020. In March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the targeted federal funds interest rate range to 0% to 0.25% percent. These reductions in interest rates and the other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, possibly materially, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, the pandemic has had negative effects on our interest income, ACL, and certain transaction-based line items of noninterest income. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including the effect of governmental and private sector initiatives, the effect of the recent rollout of vaccinations for the virus, whether such vaccinations will be effective against any resurgence of the virus, including any new strain, and the ability for customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routine.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to protect our employees, customers and communities. In March 2020, as part of our efforts to exercise social distancing, we closed all of our banking lobbies (other than by appointment) and conducted most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. At this time, our lobbies have been reopened, but we encourage customers to use drive-thru or electronic means to conduct their banking, and are following social distancing and personal protective protocols as directed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, a majority of our workforce has been working from home since mid-March 2020, and we expect this to continue through at least the first quarter of 2021, or until vaccines are more widely available.\nResults of Operation and Financial Condition\nWe are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operation and financial condition. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly impacted the health of the overall real estate industry in our markets, which have reflected relative stability over the past three years. In addition, we have not experienced significant incurred losses on loans or received communications from our borrowers that significant losses were imminent. While management does not currently expect the next year to result in the precipitous decline in the value of certain real estate assets similar to the declines seen in 2009 to 2010, our forecast includes assumptions for certain loss scenarios that may occur due to the exhaustion of federal stimulus funds or a decrease in market valuations. Accordingly, in 2020, we determined it prudent to increase our provision for credit losses in anticipation of continued market risk and uncertainty at this time. Our provision for credit losses was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was unchanged from the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Our allowance for credit losses increased $14.1 million during 2020, which was impacted by both our adoption of the new CECL methodology and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions. Although we did not record additional provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, as periods ending after December 31, 2020 may also be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also adjust our investment securities portfolio to fair value each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold as well as experience reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $18.6 million of goodwill. As of March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2020, we considered whether a quantitative assessment of our goodwill was required because of the significant economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately determined that a quantitative assessment was not required at those period ends. At November 30, 2020, we performed our recurring annual review for any goodwill impairment. At the end of each of these periods, we determined no goodwill impairment existed. However, further delayed recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy, financial markets, and the associated impacts on our customers, employees and vendors, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLending Operations and Accommodations to Borrowers\nTo more fully support our customers during the pandemic, we established client assistance programs, including offering commercial, consumer, and mortgage loan payment deferrals for certain clients. During 2020, we executed 499 of these deferrals on loan balances of $231.3 million. In accordance with interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short term deferrals were not considered troubled debt restructurings. As of December 31, 2020, 448 loans previously in deferral status, representing loan balances of $198.6 million, had resumed payments or paid off, and 51 loans totaling $32.7 million remained in active deferral status, of which only $4.4 million were in\nnonaccrual status. We also suspended late fees for consumer loans through June 30, 2020, and, although consumer late fees have been reinstated, we will continue to evaluate any late fee suspension based on the borrower's financial situation and prior payment history. In addition, we paused new foreclosure and repossession actions through December 31, 2020, and will continue to re-evaluate these activities based on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nWe are also participating in the CARES Act. During 2020, as part of the first round\u201d of the SBA PPP program, we processed 746 PPP loan applications, representing a total of $136.7 million. In early October, we started the application process for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect this process to continue through the first quarter of 2021, with funds to be received from the SBA for the forgiven loans well into the second quarter of 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had originated two loans for $305,000 under the Main Street Lending Program. We recorded $2.4 million of net fee income on PPP loans in 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, unearned net fee income on PPP loans totaled $420,000. Finally, with the governmental authorization of the second round\u201d of the SBA PPP in late 2020, we are now originating additional PPP loans, and anticipate filing for forgiveness of these loans with the SBA in the latter half of 2021.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by credit losses.\nWe believe there could be potential stresses on liquidity management as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, as customers manage their own liquidity stress, we could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of credit.\nWe have developed new processes to monitor our liquidity on a daily basis, and have run stress testing based on various economic assumptions under stress and severe stress scenarios. In addition, management continues to communicate each week in structured meetings with key staff to ensure all current events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as; federal government stimulus check receipt, PPP loan fundings and the forgiveness application process, are managed appropriately.\nFinancial overview\nIn 2020, we recorded net income of $27.8 million, or $0.92 per fully diluted share, which compares with $39.5 million, or $1.30 per fully diluted share, in 2019, and $34.0 million, or $1.12 per fully diluted share, in 2018. Our basic earnings per share for the periods presented were $0.94 in 2020, $1.32 in 2019 and $1.14 in 2018. Our 2020 net income decreased primarily due to $10.4 million of provision for credit losses recorded in 2020, compared to a provision for loan and lease losses of $1.6 million in 2019 and $1.2 million in 2018. The increase in provision expense in 2020 was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and market interest rate reductions, and the adoption of the CECL methodology, which requires provision to be recorded based on future expected credit losses, as compared to the prior methodology of provision expense based on historically incurred losses. Net loan charge-offs were $979,000 in 2020 and $817,000 in 2019, compared to net loan recoveries of $317,000 in 2018. The reduction of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2020 also impacted our net interest income, which decreased $5.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, but increased $812,000 over 2018, due primarily to higher volumes on earning assets and decreases in the cost of funds. Our 2020 net income was favorably impacted by $10.0 million of growth in our residential mortgage banking revenues, compared to 2019, and $9.4 million of growth, compared to 2018. The low interest rate environment in 2020 resulted in a significant increase in mortgage loan refinancing and new mortgage originations.\nNet interest and dividend income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, for 2020 compared to 2019. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $122.0 million, or 6.4%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Contributing to this growth was average PPP loans of $83.3 million in 2020, as well as organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate-investor loan portfolios. Offsetting our loan growth in 2020, compared to 2019, was an 88 basis point decrease in average rates earned on interest earning assets. Average interest bearing deposits increased $78.8 million, or 5.4%, for 2020 compared to 2019, while average deposit rates decreased 23 basis points over the same period. The decrease in rates was primarily due to the falling interest rate environment in 2020, due to the Federal Reserve rate reductions in March 2020, and deposit accounts repricing to the lower rates as the year progressed, which impacted all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $181.8 million, or 27.9%, from 2019 to 2020, as a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with federal stimulus funds received due to COVID-19 and the CARES Act, as well as growth in our commercial, leases, construction, and commercial real estate loans.\nNet interest and dividend income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, for 2019 compared to 2018. Average loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $118.9 million, or 6.7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, resulting from organic loan growth in our commercial, leases, and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Average interest bearing deposits decreased $17.1 million, or 1.2%, for 2019 compared to 2018, while average rates increased 12 basis points. This increase in rates was primarily due to the rising interest rate environment in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, which impacted interest rates on all interest-bearing deposit categories. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased by $41.6 million, or 6.8%, from 2018 to 2019, a result of commercial demand deposit growth which correlated with growth in our commercial, leases and commercial real estate loans.\nWe continued to reposition our balance sheet in 2020 to provide appropriate funding for loan growth, ensure adequate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduce asset quality risk, and decrease our cost of funds through organic deposit growth. In 2020, our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased $11.5 million, compared to 2019, primarily from purchases in the fourth quarter of 2020 of short duration, high credit quality bonds, net of securities paydowns and calls, to utilize a portion of our excess liquidity on hand. In 2019, our available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased $56.6 million, compared to 2018, primarily from sales in the third quarter of 2019 due to interest rate reductions and the tightening of credit spreads, which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease to interest income for 2019, compared to 2018. Net securities losses of $25,000 were recorded in 2020, compared to net securities gains of $4.5 million and $360,000 recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to sales and calls during those years. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $10.8 million, to $1.70 billion in 2020 from $1.69 billion in 2019, as funding needs in 2020 were also met by an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits year over year.\nManagement also continued to emphasize credit quality and maintained our capital ratios with continued strong liquidity. In 2020, we experienced loan growth of $104.0 million, or 5.4%, over 2019. The growth was driven by PPP loan originations, which totaled $74.1 million as of year end 2020, as well as an active commercial lending team in new and existing markets, and the continued development of a lease lending team. Asset quality levels have remained steady over the last few years in comparison to total loans, as nonperforming assets, increased to $25.5 million for 2020, compared to $20.9 million for 2019 and $23.5 million for 2018. We also continued to take steps to control operating expenses and increase net income. A decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.5 million in 2020 resulted in an increase of $228,000 in net other real estate owned expenses for 2020 compared to 2019, and a decline in other real estate owned holdings of $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted in a minimal increase of $27,000 in the like period. As we focused on reducing all noninterest expenses, we were able to maintain our profitable wealth management business and secondary residential real estate originations and sales as important sources of noninterest income.\nCritical accounting policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the banking industry. These policies require the reliance on estimates, assumptions and judgements, which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Therefore, we consider these policies, discussed below, to be critical accounting estimates and discuss them directly with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.\nSignificant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of the financial statements included in this annual report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Recent accounting pronouncements and standards that have impacted or could potentially affect us are also discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for credit losses\nDetermining the allowance for loan and lease losses has historically been identified as a critical accounting policy. On January 1, 2020, we adopted the new CECL accounting methodology which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Previously, an allowance for loan and lease losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses is also a critical accounting policy\u201d as:\n \u25cf changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results; \n \u25cf estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default; and \n \u25cf the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and \n \u25cf considerable judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime expected credit losses. \nBecause our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Changes in Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of our Allowance for Credit Losses.\nAs a result of management's modeling, an allowance for credit losses on loans totaling $33.9 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020; in addition, an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $3.0 million was recorded as of December 31, 2020, within other liabilities. There was no allowance for credit losses on securities determined to be required per management's review at year end 2020. A provision for credit losses of $10.4 million was recorded in 2020, comprised of a $9.2 million provision for credit losses on loans and a $1.2 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments, compared to $1.6 million and $1.2 million of loan and lease loss provision recorded in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the ACL is included in the Allowances for Credit Losses\u201d section below.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe use of fair values is required in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities, as well as for specific disclosures. Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.\nIn determining the fair value of financial instruments, market prices of the same or similar instruments are used whenever such prices are available. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. Fair value is estimated using modeling techniques and incorporates assumptions about interest rates, duration, prepayment speeds, risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. These assumptions are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which, among other topics addressed, required business entities to use the exit price notion, as defined in ASC 820, for the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Adoption of this standard resulted in our use of an exit price rather than an entrance price to determine the fair value of loans and deposits not already measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet disclosures. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements\u201d and Note 17 Fair Values of Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements which include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used for further information regarding the valuation processes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis annual report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the presentation of net interest income and net interest income to interest earning assets on a tax equivalent ( TE\u201d) basis and our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (a) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of our operating performance, (b) enables a more complete understanding of factor and trends affecting our business, and (c) allows investors to evaluate our performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts, and bank regulators. Management uses non-GAAP measures as follows:\nin the preparation of our operating budgets, monthly financial performance reporting, and in our presentation to investors of our performance. However, we acknowledge that these non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below or alongside the first instance where each non-GAAP financial measure is used.\nResults of operations\nNet interest income\nNet interest income, which is our primary source of earnings, is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, as well as accretion income on purchased loans, and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends upon the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest-earning assets to total assets and of interest-bearing liabilities to total funding sources, and movements in market interest rates. Our net interest income can be significantly influenced by a variety of factors, including overall loan demand, economic conditions, credit risk, the amount of nonearning assets including nonperforming loans, the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice, variances in prepayment of loans and securities, early withdrawal of deposits, exercise of call options on borrowings or securities, a general rise or decline in interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield-curve, and balance sheet growth or contraction. Our asset and liability committee ( ALCO\u201d) seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring our balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions. This process is discussed in more detail in the section entitled Interest rate risk\u201d in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Rate Risk.\u201d\nOur net interest income decreased $5.0 million, or 5.2%, to $91.8 million for 2020, from $96.8 million for 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in market interest rates on loans and securities, and was partially offset by decreases in interest rates on deposits and reductions in short and long-term borrowings. Our net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 3.43% for the year ended 2020, compared to 3.98% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, was 3.48% for the year ended 2020, compared to 4.06% for the year ended 2019, a decrease of 58 basis points. Although average interest earning assets increased $241.3 million during 2020, the market rate reductions were more impactful than the volume growth of lower yielding assets. The decrease in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to lower rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as a reduction of our short-term funding needs, as our excess liquidity on hand allowed us to utilize minimal short-term borrowings for the majority of 2020.\nOur net interest income increased $5.8 million, or 6.4%, to $96.8 million for 2019, from $90.9 million for 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by a full year impact of our acquisition of ABC Bank, and was partially offset by increases in interest expense. Our net interest margin was 3.98% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.87% for the year ended 2018, an increase of 11 basis points. Our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent (TE) basis, which is net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets, was 4.06% for the year ended 2019, compared to 3.96% for the year ended 2018, an increase of ten basis points. The growth in our net interest margin was due to higher loan volumes in 2019, coupled with $2.1 million of discount accretion on loans acquired in our ABC Bank acquisition in 2018 and Talmer branch purchase in late 2016. The increase in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to higher rates paid on all interest bearing deposits, as well as additional short-term funding needs, which increased due to our loan growth and was financed by FHLBC borrowings, which reprice daily.\nOur average earning assets increased"}
