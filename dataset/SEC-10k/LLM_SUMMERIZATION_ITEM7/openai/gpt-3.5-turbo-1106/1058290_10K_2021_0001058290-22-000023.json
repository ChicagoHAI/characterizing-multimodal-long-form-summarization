Our recently completed acquisitions contributed 320 basis points to our revenue growth. Revenue growth also reflected our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies and was aided by the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth in the Healthcare segment was driven by increased demand for our services from our pharmaceutical clients while continued adoption and integration of digital technologies across our manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients drove revenue growth in the Products and Resources segment. Revenues in the Communications, Media and Technology segment benefited from our technology clients' growing demand for services related to digital content. Our 2020 revenue was negatively affected by the Samlink Impact, which contributed approximately 70 basis points to our 2021 revenue growth. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our non-digital services as our clients, particularly those in the Financial Services segment, optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations.\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin1 increased to 15.3% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our 2021 GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins benefited from savings generated by the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan and a decrease in travel and entertainment costs. These benefits were partially offset by investments intended to drive and support organic revenue growth, including additions to our sales organization and initiatives to reposition our brand, as well as the negative impact on margin of our recently completed acquisitions, increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated attrition and costs related to the modernization of our\n1 Adjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and constant currency revenue growth are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our 2020 operating margins were adversely impacted by the decline in revenues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Samlink Impact and the April 2020 ransomware attack. Our 2020 GAAP operating margin was also negatively impacted by costs related to our restructuring program that concluded at the end of 2020 and COVID-19 Charges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached a settlement agreement with the final customer involved in our previously disclosed proposed exit from a large customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary and additionally entered into an agreement to sell this subsidiary. We reached settlement agreements with the other two customers to this engagement in the second quarter of 2021. The financial terms of the final settlement agreements with the three customers did not materially differ from our original 2020 offer and, accordingly, the impact to our 2021 consolidated statement of operations was immaterial. In 2020, in connection with our settlement offer, we recorded a reduction of revenues of $118 million and additional expenses of $33 million, or, jointly, the Samlink Impact. This negatively impacted both our 2020 GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS2 by $0.27. The sale of our Samlink subsidiary closed on February 1, 2022. In 2021, our Samlink subsidiary had $113 million in revenues.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the parties to the consolidated putative securities class action suit filed a settlement agreement that resolved the consolidated putative securities class action against us and certain of our former officers. As a result, we recorded a $20 million Class Action Settlement Loss in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated financial statements. The loss is excluded from Adjusted Operating Margin2 and Adjusted Diluted EPS2. For further information see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Outlook\nAs we seek to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth, our four strategic priorities are:\n\u2022Accelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;\n\u2022Globalizing Cognizant - accelerating the growth of our business in key international markets and diversifying our leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;\n\u2022Repositioning our brand - improving our global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite; and\n\u2022Increasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.\nWe continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into software-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our clients' need to modernize their business, which has led to increased demand for digital capabilities. In 2021, we completed seven acquisitions intended to expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries.\nAs our clients seek to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations, our non-digital services have been and may continue to be subject to pricing pressure. In addition, our clients will likely continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, which could affect their demand for our services.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand. Competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense, and we experienced significantly elevated voluntary attrition during 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 34.6% as compared to 19.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 30.8% as compared to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Challenges attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel have negatively impacted our ability to satisfy client demand and achieve our full revenue potential. We expect this impact to continue in 2022. Further, our ongoing and anticipated future efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement may not be successful and may result in increased delivery costs during 2022. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees. In certain regions, competition for employees with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. While we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the\n2 Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nWe believe environmental and social considerations are increasingly important to our clients and the talent we seek to attract and retain. As a company committed to improving everyday life, ESG is an important part of our business and that of our clients. Cognizant's vision is to become the preeminent technology services provider to the leaders of the world's Global 2000 companies. Our ESG program is designed to support that vision and aligns with our clients' increasing focus on ESG. In 2021, we took the following steps to advance our ESG agenda:\n\u2022In February 2021, we announced an initiative to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and health and well-being in communities around the world through new philanthropic funding and in-kind contributions;\n\u2022In April 2021, as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic gripped India, we launched Operation C3. This initiative facilitated vaccination for our Indian employees and their dependents, and set up vaccination drives across the country to help senior citizens, physically challenged dependents, and mothers with infants. Operation C3 also provided critical medical equipment to hospitals, helped to boost oxygen supplies and more;\n\u2022In June 2021, we issued our first ESG report with assured greenhouse gas emissions data;\n\u2022In October 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. This pledge calls for reducing emissions by 50% from the Company's global operations and supply chain by 2030, and by 90% by 2040; and\n\u2022In October 2021, we launched All Belong,\u201d an initiative led by our executive committee and global D&I team designed to strengthen employee engagement, showcase our affinity groups, and recognize employees who exemplify inclusion.\nTable 60:

The gains and losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to non-U.S. dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $847 million. The decrease in interest income of $89 million was primarily attributable to lower invested balances in India, which generate higher yields.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cognizant </td> <td>30\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, set forth below, should be carefully evaluated.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income From Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude unusual items. Additionally, Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. The income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period's foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment.\nWe believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures along with reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure for the years ended December 31:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

As these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.\nOther Liquidity and Capital Resources Information\nWe seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. We evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the United States.\nWe expect our operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, pay our purchase commitments and Tax Reform Act transition tax payments and service our debt for the next twelve months. Our Tax Reform Act transition tax payments are due in annual installments of $50 million, $94 million, $126 million and $157 million through 2025. We also have purchase commitments of approximately $263 million which will be paid over the next two years. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.\nOur ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet our long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital allocation framework will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.\n8 Free cash flow is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cognizant </td> <td>33\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Estimates </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. However, the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method, if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered. The cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. Such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. Net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. We are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. As a result, and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for APAs before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions. It could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications. The consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances, such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for APAs.\nOur provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest, which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets, including indefinite-lived intangible assets, arise from the accounting for business combinations. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nWe exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, regulatory environment, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition. Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cognizant </td> <td>34\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. Under the income approach, we estimate projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and long-term growth rates, and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The discount rate used is based on a market participant weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nBased on our most recent evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, we concluded that the goodwill in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $5,620 million.\nWe review our finite-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups. The impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Forward Looking Statements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act) that involve risks and uncertainties.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n Executive Summary \nCognizant is one of the world's leading professional services companies, engineering modern business for the digital era. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We are continuing to invest in digital services with a focus on four key areas: IoT, digital engineering, data and cloud. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers. We help clients modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so they can stay ahead in a fast-changing world.\n2021 Financial Results\n Revenue \n Income from Operations \n Operating Margin \n Diluted EPS \n  GAAP   Adjusted\n  GAAP   Adjusted\n  GAAP   Adjusted\n \n \n \n \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues increased by $1,855 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, representing growth of 11.1%, or 10.0% on a constant currency basis1. Our recently completed acquisitions contributed 320 basis points to our revenue growth. Revenue growth also reflected our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies and was aided by the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth in the Healthcare segment was driven by increased demand for our services from our pharmaceutical clients while continued adoption and integration of digital technologies across our manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients drove revenue growth in the Products and Resources segment. Revenues in the Communications, Media and Technology segment benefited from our technology clients' growing demand for services related to digital content. Our 2020 revenue was negatively affected by the Samlink Impact, which contributed approximately 70 basis points to our 2021 revenue growth. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our non-digital services as our clients, particularly those in the Financial Services segment, optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations.\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin1 increased to 15.3% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our 2021 GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins benefited from savings generated by the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan and a decrease in travel and entertainment costs. These benefits were partially offset by investments intended to drive and support organic revenue growth, including additions to our sales organization and initiatives to reposition our brand, as well as the negative impact on margin of our recently completed acquisitions, increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated attrition and costs related to the modernization of our\n1 Adjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and constant currency revenue growth are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our 2020 operating margins were adversely impacted by the decline in revenues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Samlink Impact and the April 2020 ransomware attack. Our 2020 GAAP operating margin was also negatively impacted by costs related to our restructuring program that concluded at the end of 2020 and COVID-19 Charges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached a settlement agreement with the final customer involved in our previously disclosed proposed exit from a large customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary and additionally entered into an agreement to sell this subsidiary. We reached settlement agreements with the other two customers to this engagement in the second quarter of 2021. The financial terms of the final settlement agreements with the three customers did not materially differ from our original 2020 offer and, accordingly, the impact to our 2021 consolidated statement of operations was immaterial. In 2020, in connection with our settlement offer, we recorded a reduction of revenues of $118 million and additional expenses of $33 million, or, jointly, the Samlink Impact. This negatively impacted both our 2020 GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS2 by $0.27. The sale of our Samlink subsidiary closed on February 1, 2022. In 2021, our Samlink subsidiary had $113 million in revenues.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the parties to the consolidated putative securities class action suit filed a settlement agreement that resolved the consolidated putative securities class action against us and certain of our former officers. As a result, we recorded a $20 million Class Action Settlement Loss in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated financial statements. The loss is excluded from Adjusted Operating Margin2 and Adjusted Diluted EPS2. For further information see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Outlook\nAs we seek to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth, our four strategic priorities are:\n\u2022Accelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;\n\u2022Globalizing Cognizant - accelerating the growth of our business in key international markets and diversifying our leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;\n\u2022Repositioning our brand - improving our global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite; and\n\u2022Increasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.\nWe continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into software-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our clients' need to modernize their business, which has led to increased demand for digital capabilities. In 2021, we completed seven acquisitions intended to expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries.\nAs our clients seek to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations, our non-digital services have been and may continue to be subject to pricing pressure. In addition, our clients will likely continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, which could affect their demand for our services.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand. Competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense, and we experienced significantly elevated voluntary attrition during 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 34.6% as compared to 19.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 30.8% as compared to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Challenges attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel have negatively impacted our ability to satisfy client demand and achieve our full revenue potential. We expect this impact to continue in 2022. Further, our ongoing and anticipated future efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement may not be successful and may result in increased delivery costs during 2022. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees. In certain regions, competition for employees with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. While we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the\n2 Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nWe believe environmental and social considerations are increasingly important to our clients and the talent we seek to attract and retain. As a company committed to improving everyday life, ESG is an important part of our business and that of our clients. Cognizant's vision is to become the preeminent technology services provider to the leaders of the world's Global 2000 companies. Our ESG program is designed to support that vision and aligns with our clients' increasing focus on ESG. In 2021, we took the following steps to advance our ESG agenda:\n\u2022In February 2021, we announced an initiative to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and health and well-being in communities around the world through new philanthropic funding and in-kind contributions;\n\u2022In April 2021, as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic gripped India, we launched Operation C3. This initiative facilitated vaccination for our Indian employees and their dependents, and set up vaccination drives across the country to help senior citizens, physically challenged dependents, and mothers with infants. Operation C3 also provided critical medical equipment to hospitals, helped to boost oxygen supplies and more;\n\u2022In June 2021, we issued our first ESG report with assured greenhouse gas emissions data;\n\u2022In October 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. This pledge calls for reducing emissions by 50% from the Company's global operations and supply chain by 2030, and by 90% by 2040; and\n\u2022In October 2021, we launched All Belong,\u201d an initiative led by our executive committee and global D&I team designed to strengthen employee engagement, showcase our affinity groups, and recognize employees who exemplify inclusion.\n\n Results of Operations \nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, including a year-to-year comparison between 2020 and 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to The Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data for the years ended December 31:\n\n \n(1) Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\n* Not meaningful\n\nDuring 2021, revenues increased by $1,855 million as compared to 2020, representing growth of 11.1%, or 10.0% on a constant currency basis3.

Our revenue growth also reflected our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies and was aided by the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenue growth also reflects the growing demand for our digital services partially offset by clients' continued focus on cost optimization of supporting their legacy systems and operations. Revenues from clients added, including those related to acquisitions, since December 31, 2020 were $77 million.4\n Healthcare - revenues increased 10.0%, or 9.6% on a constant currency basis4 \nRevenue growth among our life sciences clients was driven by increased demand for our services among pharmaceutical companies while revenue growth among our healthcare customers benefited from increased demand by health insurance customers for our integrated software solutions. Additionally, revenue growth reflected the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues from clients added since December 31, 2020 were $45 million.\n\n4 Constant currency revenue growth is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, our clients will likely continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, which could affect their demand for our services.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand. Competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense, and we experienced significantly elevated voluntary attrition during 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 34.6% as compared to 19.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 30.8% as compared to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Challenges attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel have negatively impacted our ability to satisfy client demand and achieve our full revenue potential. We expect this impact to continue in 2022. Further, our ongoing and anticipated future efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement may not be successful and may result in increased delivery costs during 2022. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees. In certain regions, competition for employees with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. While we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the\n2 Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nWe believe environmental and social considerations are increasingly important to our clients and the talent we seek to attract and retain. As a company committed to improving everyday life, ESG is an important part of our business and that of our clients. Cognizant's vision is to become the preeminent technology services provider to the leaders of the world's Global 2000 companies. Our ESG program is designed to support that vision and aligns with our clients' increasing focus on ESG. In 2021, we took the following steps to advance our ESG agenda:\n\u2022In February 2021, we announced an initiative to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and health and well-being in communities around the world through new philanthropic funding and in-kind contributions;\n\u2022In April 2021, as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic gripped India, we launched Operation C3. This initiative facilitated vaccination for our Indian employees and their dependents, and set up vaccination drives across the country to help senior citizens, physically challenged dependents, and mothers with infants. Operation C3 also provided critical medical equipment to hospitals, helped to boost oxygen supplies and more;\n\u2022In June 2021, we issued our first ESG report with assured greenhouse gas emissions data;\n\u2022In October 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. This pledge calls for reducing emissions by 50% from the Company's global operations and supply chain by 2030, and by 90% by 2040; and\n\u2022In October 2021, we launched All Belong,\u201d an

Our revenue growth also reflected our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies and was aided by the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our 2020 revenue was negatively affected by the Samlink Impact, which contributed approximately 70 basis points to our 2021 revenue growth.
