    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the information under the headings \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d Part II. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and Part I. Item 1. Business,\u201d as well as the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes thereto. The following MD&A gives effect to the recast as described in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to the separation, our operations were included in Huntsman's financial results in different legal forms, including but not limited to: (1) wholly-owned subsidiaries for which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses were the sole businesses; (2) legal entities which are comprised of other businesses and include the Titanium Dioxide and/or Performance Additives businesses; and (3) variable interest entities in which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses are the primary beneficiaries. The consolidated and combined financial statements include all revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows directly attributable to us. The consolidated and combined financial statements also include allocations of direct and indirect corporate expenses through the date of the separation, which are based upon an allocation method that in the opinion of management is reasonable. Because the historical consolidated and combined financial information for the periods prior to the separation reflect the combination of these legal entities under common control, the historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the separation includes the results of operations of other Huntsman businesses that are not a part of our operations after the separation. We report the results of those other businesses as discontinued operations. Please see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nIn addition, the consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared from Huntsman's historical accounting records through the separation and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if our operations had been conducted separately from Huntsman; however, prior to the separation, we did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the periods presented and, as such, the consolidated and combined financial statements reflecting balances and activity prior to the separation, may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company.\nFor purposes of these consolidated and combined financial statements, all significant transactions with Huntsman International have been included in group equity. All intercompany transactions within the consolidated and combined business have been eliminated.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products.\nRecent Developments\nPotential Acquisition of Tronox European Paper Laminates Business\nOn July 16, 2018, we announced that we reached an agreement with Tronox Limited ( Tronox\u201d) to purchase the European paper laminates business (the 8120 Grade\u201d) from Tronox upon the closing of their proposed merger with The National Titanium Dioxide Company Limited (\"Cristal\"). In connection with the acquisition, Tronox would supply the 8120 Grade to us under a Transitional Supply Agreement until the transfer of the manufacturing of the 8120 Grade to our Greatham, U.K., facility has been completed.\nPori Fire\nOn January 30, 2017, our TiO2 manufacturing facility in Pori, Finland, experienced fire damage. The loss was covered by insurance for property damage as well as business interruption losses subject to retained deductibles of $15 million and 60 days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $371 million of income related to insurance recoveries in cost of goods sold while $187 million was recognized in 2017. The Pori facility had a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons per year, which represented approximately 17% of our total TiO2 nameplate capacity and approximately 2% of total global TiO2 demand. Prior to the fire, 60% of the site capacity produced specialty products which, on average, contributed greater than 75% of the site EBITDA from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2017. We have restored 20% of the total prior capacity, which is dedicated to production of specialty products.\nOn September 12, 2018, following our review of the Pori facility and options within our manufacturing network, and as a result of unanticipated cost escalation and extended timeline associated with reconstruction, we announced that we intend to close our Pori, Finland, TiO2 manufacturing facility and transfer the specialty and differentiated product grades to other sites. We intend to continue to operate the Pori facility at reduced production rates through the transition period, which is expected to last through at least 2022, subject to economic and other factors. We currently plan to transfer certain technology and the production of select product grades, namely for inks, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food grade applications, from Pori to other sites within our network. In addition, and as market conditions warrant, we intend to strengthen the existing manufacturing network by increasing its efficiency and by providing greater manufacturing flexibility. Please see \"Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-We may be unsuccessful in our announced intentions to close the Pori, Finland site and transfer specialty and differentiated production to other sites within our manufacturing network within the anticipated timeframe and we may not experience the full anticipated benefits of our transfer and strengthen program.\"\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nIn 2019, we expect results in our Titanium Dioxide segment to reflect: (i) soft near-term demand largely as a result of customer destocking; (ii) regional disparities in TiO2 pricing trends reflecting specific supply and demand balances; (iii) soft economic environment in China and Europe, including the direct and indirect effects of Brexit; (iv) manageable raw material and energy cost increases; (v) seasonal improvement in volumes in the first half of 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018; (vi) increased production of specialty and differentiated product grades; and (vii) additional cost improvement actions. In our Performance Additives segment, we expect near-term business trends to be driven by: (i) a seasonal improvement in sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2018; (ii) continued pricing momentum; (iii) softer economic conditions in China and Europe; (iv) increased raw material and energy costs; and (v) additional cost improvement actions.\nWe completed the actions to deliver the fixed cost reduction target as part of our 2017 Business Improvement Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. The full $60 million run rate benefit is expected to be captured in the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019 we announced additional cost reduction initiatives which are expected to provide approximately $40 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefit compared to 2018. Actions are expected to be complete in 2020 ending 2020 at the full run rate level.\nIn 2019, we expect to spend approximately $130 million on capital expenditures, which includes spending to transfer our specialty technology from Pori to other sites in our manufacturing network.\nWe expect our corporate and other costs will be approximately $50 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nThe

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, net, income tax benefit (expense) from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) net income of discontinued operations, net of tax; (e) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; and (i) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nNevertheless, our management recognizes that there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of us as compared to net income. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.\nIn addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) significant changes to income tax valuation allowances; (e) net income of discontinued operations; (f) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (g) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (h) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (i) net plant incident (credits) costs; (j) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs.

Adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share reflects all potential dilutive ordinary shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.

The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in average selling price, a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and a 1% increase due to mix and other, offset by a 13% decrease in volumes. The increase in selling prices compared to the prior year reflects more favorable business conditions allowing for an increase in prices globally. Sales volumes decreased primarily due to customer destocking and lower availability of certain specialty product grades due, in part, to extended planned maintenance turnarounds, reduced operating rates at our Pori, Finland manufacturing facility and other plant closures as part of our restructuring programs. Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant and the impact of plants closed as part of our restructuring programs, sales volumes decreased by 9% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is primarily a result of improvements in pricing, $19 million of benefits as a result of our 2017 business improvement program, and the sale of $14 million of energy credits in 2018, offset by the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs and the impact of insurance proceeds received in 2017 to reimburse lost earnings from our Pori, Finland facility.\nPerformance Additives\nThe Performance Additives segment generated $599 million of revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, a decline of $6 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2017 resulting from a 4% decrease in volumes and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable impact of sales mix and other partially offset by a 3% increase in pricing and a 2% improvement from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decline in volumes was primarily as a result of customer destocking in Functional Additives, the discontinuation of sales of certain Timber Treatment products to a large customer, and plant shutdowns in the second quarter of 2018 as part of our restructuring plans, while the increase in selling prices is as a result of price increases for certain products within Functional Additives, Color Pigments and Timber Treatment to offset higher raw material and energy costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Performance Additives segment decreased by $10 million, or 14%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher raw materials and energy costs, offset by higher average selling prices and $8 million of benefits from our 2017 business improvement program.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate and other represents expenses which are not allocated to our segments. Losses from Corporate and other were $43 million, or $21 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 than the same period in 2017 as our costs to operate as a standalone company are lower than those costs historically allocated to us from Huntsman.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $144 million on revenues of $2,209 million, compared with a net loss of $77 million on revenues of $2,139 million for the same period in 2016.

Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant, sales volumes decreased by 2% as compared to the same period in 2016.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA of our Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $326 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in revenue of $321 million related to higher selling prices and a $36 million reduction in costs, primarily due to our 2017 business improvement program, offset by an increase in other manufacturing costs of $27 million.\nPerformance Additives\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Additives segment of $20 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to a 1% improvement in average selling prices and a 2% increase in sales volumes. The improvement in prices was primarily in our Functional Additives product line where we successfully raised prices to offset increases in prices of raw materials.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA in our Performance Additives segment increased by $3 million, or 4%, due to increases in\nrevenues from higher volumes and selling prices. These increases were offset by increased costs and the release of an environmental reserve relating to a previously owned property in the third quarter of 2016, which drove a net decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA year over year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net loss from continuing operations was $85 million on revenues of $2,139\nmillion, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $362 million on revenues of $2,162 million in 2015.

Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of competitive pressure while sales volumes increased primarily due to increased end-use demand.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA increased by $69 million primarily due to savings resulting from our restructuring programs and a decrease in other operating expenses of $11 million due to insurance proceeds received relating to a 2015 casualty loss at our Uerdingen, Germany manufacturing facility, partially offset by a $30 million decrease in revenue.\nPerformance Additives\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Additives segment of $7 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31,\n2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was due to 4% increase from an increase in sales volumes partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and a 2% decrease form sales mix and other. Segment adjusted EBITDA was consistent year over year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to the separation, our primary source of liquidity and capital resources was cash flows from operations, our participation in a cash pooling program with Huntsman and debt incurred by Huntsman. Following the separation, we have not received any funding through the Huntsman cash pooling program. We had cash and cash equivalents of $165 million and $238 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over the next 12 months. Additionally, we believe our future obligations, including needs for capital expenditures will be met by available cash generated from operations and borrowings.\nOn August 8, 2017, in connection with our IPO and the separation, we entered into new financing arrangements and incurred new debt, including $375 million of Senior Notes issued by our subsidiaries Venator Finance S.\u00e0 r.l. and Venator Materials LLC (the \"Issuers\"), and borrowings of $375 million under the term loan facility. We used the net proceeds of the Senior Notes and the Term Loan Facility to repay $732 million of net intercompany debt owed to Huntsman and to pay related fees and expenses of $18 million. Substantially all Huntsman receivables or payables were eliminated in connection with the separation, other than a payable to Huntsman for a liability pursuant to the tax matters agreement entered into at the time of the separation which has been presented as Noncurrent payable to affiliate within the consolidated and combined balance sheet.\nIn addition to the Senior Notes and the Term Loan Facility, we entered into the ABL Facility. Availability to borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation comprising both accounts receivable and inventory in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Germany and only accounts receivable in France and Spain. Thus, the base calculation may fluctuate from time to time and may be further impacted by the lenders' discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks that might otherwise incrementally increase borrowing availability. The borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2018 is in excess of $268 million, of which $259 million is available to be drawn.\nItems Impacting Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity\nOur liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. The following matters had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash inflows from our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, decreased by $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as reflected in our consolidated and combined statements of cash flows.

Our future expenditures include certain EHS maintenance and upgrades; periodic maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities; expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities; certain cost reduction projects; and the cost to transfer our specialty and differentiated manufacturing from Pori, Finland to other sites within our manufacturing network. We expect to fund this spending with cash on hand as well as cash provided by operations and borrowings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of $47 million.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $371 million of income related to insurance recoveries in cost of goods sold while $187 million was recognized in 2017.The Pori facility had a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons per year, which represented approximately 17% of our total TiO2 nameplate capacity and approximately 2% of total global TiO2 demand. Prior to the fire, 60% of the site capacity produced specialty products which, on average, contributed greater than 75% of the site EBITDA from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2017.

We currently intend to continue to operate the Pori facility at reduced production rates through the transition period, which is expected to last through at least 2022, subject to economic and other factors. We plan to transfer certain technology and the production of select product grades, namely for inks, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food grade applications, from Pori to other sites within our network. In addition, and as market conditions warrant, we will strengthen the existing manufacturing network by increasing its efficiency and by providing greater manufacturing flexibility. Please see \"Part II, Item 1A.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared with the same period of 2017 was primarily attributable to the $301 million decrease in net income described in -Results of Operations\u201d above, a $263 million unfavorable variance in changes in assets and liabilities, and an unfavorable decrease in deferred income taxes of $38 million, partially offset by an increase in noncash restructuring and impairment charges of $584 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $321 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $11 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared with the same period of 2017 was primarily attributable to a $205 million increase in capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds for recovery of property damage, an increase in net payments from affiliates of $121 million year over year, partially offset by a change of $10 million related to cash received and cash invested in unconsolidated affiliates.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $18 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of $123 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared with the same period of 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $732 million final settlement of affiliate balances at separation and a decrease in net repayments on affiliates accounts payable of $100 million from 2017 to 2018, offset by a decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of the Senior Notes and Senior Credit facilities net of the payment of debt issuance costs of $732 million in 2017.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $337 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 while net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $80 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period of 2016 was primarily attributable to the $221 million increase in net income described in -Results of Operations\u201d above, a favorable increase in deferred income taxes of $33 million, and a favorable increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $11 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $96 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period of 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in (advances to) payments from affiliates of $126 million year over year. Partially offset by a net cash outflow of $9 million related to cash received and cash invested in unconsolidated affiliates and an $18 million increase in capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds for recovery of property damage.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $123 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of $32 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period of 2016 was primarily attributable to $732 million final settlement of affiliate balances at separation and an increase in net repayments on affiliates accounts payable of $147 million from 2016 to 2017 offset by proceeds from the issuance of

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated and combined financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Description Of Business, Recent Developments, Basis Of Presentation and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of this report. Summarized below are our critical accounting policies:\nEmployee Benefit Programs\nWe sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Finland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. We fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held separately from us. We also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the U.S. and Canada. Amounts recorded in our consolidated and combined financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various third-party actuaries. Inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the end of the year. For our U.S. and non-U.S. plans, the discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields.\nThe following weighted-average discount rate assumptions were used for the defined benefit and other postretirement plans for the year: Table 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>2.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net periodic pension cost\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net periodic pension cost\n</td> <td>3.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected long-term return for each asset class. The expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets was 7.75% in 2018 and 2017, each, and the expected rate of return on non-U.S. plans was 5.21% and 5.68% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations.\nManagement, with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based. The effect of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Statement of\nOperations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet\nImpact(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Estimated (decrease) increase on 2018 net periodic benefit cost\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Estimated (decrease) increase on December 31, 2018 pension and postretirement liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. We evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. These conclusions require significant judgment. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. Cumulative losses incurred over the period limit our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. Changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, we had total valuation allowances of $220 million. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Income Taxes\u201d of this report for more information regarding our valuation allowances.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our non-U.K. subsidiaries have no plan to distribute earnings in a manner that would cause them to be subject to U.K., U.S., or other local country taxation.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. We are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. This requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law. Additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. These judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience, engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets. The estimated lives of our property range from 3 to 50 years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. Inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed. Without on-going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter.\nManagement uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. At December 31, 2018, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2018 would have been approximately $12 million less or $15 million greater, respectively.\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management's plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant. We evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values. Key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures, raw material pricing and regulations. In connection with our asset evaluation policy, we reviewed all of our long-lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nRestructuring and Plant Closing and Transition Costs\nWe recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations, workforce reductions and other cost savings programs in each of our business segments. These charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan. Estimates for plant closing costs include the write-off of the carrying value of the plant, any necessary environmental and/or regulatory costs, contract termination and demolition costs. Estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated, termination benefits to be provided and other information, as necessary. Management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate. For further discussion of our restructuring activities, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing and Transition Costs\u201d of this report.\nContingent Loss Accruals\nEnvironmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. We accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. The extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. Our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. Adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had recognized a liability of $12 million, each, related to these environmental matters. For further information, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 23. Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d of this report.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. We have an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. These policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further information, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 22. Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings\u201d of this report.\nVariable Interest Entities-Primary Beneficiary\nWe evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on-going basis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. Management assesses, on an on-going basis, the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity, including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as well as the amount of risk that we bear and rewards we receive in regard to the entity, to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. Management judgment is required to assess whether these attributes are significant. The factors management considers when determining if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of our variable interest entity's economic performance include supply arrangements, manufacturing arrangements, marketing arrangements and sales arrangements. We consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the percentage of revenues from our consolidated variable interest entities in relation to total revenues that will ultimately be attributable to Venator is 5.2%, 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively. For further information, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 8. Variable Interest Entities\u201d of this report.",
    "summary": "The report provides Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and focuses on the basis of presentation, recent developments, recent trends and outlook, and results of operations. It explains that the financial statements have been prepared from Huntsman's historical accounting records and presents the financial results for 2018, 2017, and 2016. The report also discusses the potential acquisition of Tronox European Paper Laminate Business and the impact of the Pori Fire on the TiO2 manufacturing facility.\n\nIn 2018, the company reported a net loss of $157 million on revenues of $2,265 million compared to a net income of $144 million on revenues of $2,209 million in 2017. The decrease in net income is attributed to various factors such as changes in revenues, operating expenses, restructuring costs, other income, and income tax benefit. The report also provides segment analysis, showing the performance of the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments, including the impact on revenues and adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAdditionally, the report includes explanations about adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and provides a comparison of 2018 with 2017, particularly discussing the average selling prices, sales volumes, and foreign currency translation impact for both segments.\n\nFinally, the report provides a discussion on various non-GAAP measures and limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. It also offers a reconciliation of net (loss) income to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders for the period.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the information under the headings \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d Part II. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and Part I. Item 1. Business,\u201d as well as the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes thereto. The following MD&A gives effect to the recast as described in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to the separation, our operations were included in Huntsman's financial results in different legal forms, including but not limited to: (1) wholly-owned subsidiaries for which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses were the sole businesses; (2) legal entities which are comprised of other businesses and include the Titanium Dioxide and/or Performance Additives businesses; and (3) variable interest entities in which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses are the primary beneficiaries. The consolidated and combined financial statements include all revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows directly attributable to us. The consolidated and combined financial statements also include allocations of direct and indirect corporate expenses through the date of the separation, which are based upon an allocation method that in the opinion of management is reasonable. Because the historical consolidated and combined financial information for the periods prior to the separation reflect the combination of these legal entities under common control, the historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the separation includes the results of operations of other Huntsman businesses that are not a part of our operations after the separation. We report the results of those other businesses as discontinued operations. Please see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nIn addition, the consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared from Huntsman's historical accounting records through the separation and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if our operations had been conducted separately from Huntsman; however, prior to the separation, we did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the periods presented and, as such, the consolidated and combined financial statements reflecting balances and activity prior to the separation, may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company.\nFor purposes of these consolidated and combined financial statements, all significant transactions with Huntsman International have been included in group equity. All intercompany transactions within the consolidated and combined business have been eliminated.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products.\nRecent Developments\nPotential Acquisition of Tronox European Paper Laminates Business\nOn July 16, 2018, we announced that we reached an agreement with Tronox Limited ( Tronox\u201d) to purchase the European paper laminates business (the 8120 Grade\u201d) from Tronox upon the closing of their proposed merger with The National Titanium Dioxide Company Limited (\"Cristal\"). In connection with the acquisition, Tronox would supply the 8120 Grade to us under a Transitional Supply Agreement until the transfer of the manufacturing of the 8120 Grade to our Greatham, U.K., facility has been completed.\nPori Fire\nOn January 30, 2017, our TiO2 manufacturing facility in Pori, Finland, experienced fire damage. The loss was covered by insurance for property damage as well as business interruption losses subject to retained deductibles of $15 million and 60 days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $371 million of income related to insurance recoveries in cost of goods sold while $187 million was recognized in 2017. The Pori facility had a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons per year, which represented approximately 17% of our total TiO2 nameplate capacity and approximately 2% of total global TiO2 demand. Prior to the fire, 60% of the site capacity produced specialty products which, on average, contributed greater than 75% of the site EBITDA from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2017. We have restored 20% of the total prior capacity, which is dedicated to production of specialty products.\nOn September 12, 2018, following our review of the Pori facility and options within our manufacturing network, and as a result of unanticipated cost escalation and extended timeline associated with reconstruction, we announced that we intend to close our Pori, Finland, TiO2 manufacturing facility and transfer the specialty and differentiated product grades to other sites. We intend to continue to operate the Pori facility at reduced production rates through the transition period, which is expected to last through at least 2022, subject to economic and other factors. We currently plan to transfer certain technology and the production of select product grades, namely for inks, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food grade applications, from Pori to other sites within our network. In addition, and as market conditions warrant, we intend to strengthen the existing manufacturing network by increasing its efficiency and by providing greater manufacturing flexibility. Please see \"Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-We may be unsuccessful in our announced intentions to close the Pori, Finland site and transfer specialty and differentiated production to other sites within our manufacturing network within the anticipated timeframe and we may not experience the full anticipated benefits of our transfer and strengthen program.\"\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nIn 2019, we expect results in our Titanium Dioxide segment to reflect: (i) soft near-term demand largely as a result of customer destocking; (ii) regional disparities in TiO2 pricing trends reflecting specific supply and demand balances; (iii) soft economic environment in China and Europe, including the direct and indirect effects of Brexit; (iv) manageable raw material and energy cost increases; (v) seasonal improvement in volumes in the first half of 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018; (vi) increased production of specialty and differentiated product grades; and (vii) additional cost improvement actions. In our Performance Additives segment, we expect near-term business trends to be driven by: (i) a seasonal improvement in sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2018; (ii) continued pricing momentum; (iii) softer economic conditions in China and Europe; (iv) increased raw material and energy costs; and (v) additional cost improvement actions.\nWe completed the actions to deliver the fixed cost reduction target as part of our 2017 Business Improvement Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. The full $60 million run rate benefit is expected to be captured in the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019 we announced additional cost reduction initiatives which are expected to provide approximately $40 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefit compared to 2018. Actions are expected to be complete in 2020 ending 2020 at the full run rate level.\nIn 2019, we expect to spend approximately $130 million on capital expenditures, which includes spending to transfer our specialty technology from Pori to other sites in our manufacturing network.\nWe expect our corporate and other costs will be approximately $50 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated and combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\n\n \nNM-Not meaningful\n (1) Our management uses adjusted EBITDA to assess financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, net, income tax benefit (expense) from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) net income of discontinued operations, net of tax; (e) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; and (i) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. \nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nNevertheless, our management recognizes that there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of us as compared to net income. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.\nIn addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.\n (2) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) significant changes to income tax valuation allowances; (e) net income of discontinued operations; (f) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (g) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (h) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (i) net plant incident (credits) costs; (j) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share reflects all potential dilutive ordinary shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. For the periods prior to our IPO, the average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share was based on the ordinary shares that were outstanding at the time of our IPO. \nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information. These measures exclude similar non-cash item as Adjusted EBITDA in order to assist our investors in comparing our performance from period to period and as such, bear similar risks as Adjusted EBITDA as documented in footnote (1) above. For that reason, adjusted net income and the related per share amounts, should not be considered in isolation and should be considered only to supplement analysis of U.S. GAAP results.\n (3) The income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We eliminated the effect of significant changes to income tax valuation allowances from our presentation of adjusted net income to allow investors to better compare our ongoing financial performance from period to period. We do not adjust for insignificant changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under U.S. GAAP. \n (4) As presented within Item 7, operating expense includes selling. general and administrative expenses and other operating expense (income), net. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net loss was $157 million on revenues of $2,265 million, compared with a net income of $144 million on revenues of $2,209 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $301 million in net income was the result of the following items:\n \u2022 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $56 million, or 3%, as compared with the same period in 2017. The increase was due to a $62 million, or 4%, increase in revenue in our Titanium Dioxide segment primarily due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by a $6 million, or 1%, decrease in revenue in our Performance Additives segment due primarily to decreases in volumes. See -Segment Analysis\u201d below. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $8 million, or 4%, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily resulting from reduced overhead costs. \n \u2022 Restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $628 million from $52 million for the same period in 2017. For more information concerning restructuring activities, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing and Transition Costs\u201d of this report. \n \u2022 Other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $33 million primarily as a result of the recognition of income in 2017 related to the change in the future payment to Huntsman pursuant to the tax matters agreement entered into as part of our separation. The change in future expected payment was due to the 2017 Tax Act's reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. \n \u2022 Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8 million compared to $50 million of income tax expense for the same period in 2017. Our income tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. For further information concerning taxes, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Income Taxes\u201d of this report. \nSegment Analysis\n\n\n \nNM-Not meaningful\n (1) Excludes revenues from tolling arrangements, by-products and raw materials. \n (2) Excludes sales volumes of by-products and raw materials. \nTitanium Dioxide\nThe Titanium Dioxide segment generated revenues of $1,666 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $62 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in average selling price, a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and a 1% increase due to mix and other, offset by a 13% decrease in volumes. The increase in selling prices compared to the prior year reflects more favorable business conditions allowing for an increase in prices globally. Sales volumes decreased primarily due to customer destocking and lower availability of certain specialty product grades due, in part, to extended planned maintenance turnarounds, reduced operating rates at our Pori, Finland manufacturing facility and other plant closures as part of our restructuring programs. Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant and the impact of plants closed as part of our restructuring programs, sales volumes decreased by 9% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is primarily a result of improvements in pricing, $19 million of benefits as a result of our 2017 business improvement program, and the sale of $14 million of energy credits in 2018, offset by the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs and the impact of insurance proceeds received in 2017 to reimburse lost earnings from our Pori, Finland facility.\nPerformance Additives\nThe Performance Additives segment generated $599 million of revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, a decline of $6 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2017 resulting from a 4% decrease in volumes and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable impact of sales mix and other partially offset by a 3% increase in pricing and a 2% improvement from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decline in volumes was primarily as a result of customer destocking in Functional Additives, the discontinuation of sales of certain Timber Treatment products to a large customer, and plant shutdowns in the second quarter of 2018 as part of our restructuring plans, while the increase in selling prices is as a result of price increases for certain products within Functional Additives, Color Pigments and Timber Treatment to offset higher raw material and energy costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Performance Additives segment decreased by $10 million, or 14%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher raw materials and energy costs, offset by higher average selling prices and $8 million of benefits from our 2017 business improvement program.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate and other represents expenses which are not allocated to our segments. Losses from Corporate and other were $43 million, or $21 million",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the information under the headings \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d Part II. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and Part I. Item 1. Business,\u201d as well as the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes thereto. The following MD&A gives effect to the recast as described in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to the separation, our operations were included in Huntsman's financial results in different legal forms, including but not limited to: (1) wholly-owned subsidiaries for which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses were the sole businesses; (2) legal entities which are comprised of other businesses and include the Titanium Dioxide and/or Performance Additives businesses; and (3) variable interest entities in which the Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses are the primary beneficiaries. The consolidated and combined financial statements include all revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows directly attributable to us. The consolidated and combined financial statements also include allocations of direct and indirect corporate expenses through the date of the separation, which are based upon an allocation method that in the opinion of management is reasonable. Because the historical consolidated and combined financial information for the periods prior to the separation reflect the combination of these legal entities under common control, the historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the separation includes the results of operations of other Huntsman businesses that are not a part of our operations after the separation. We report the results of those other businesses as discontinued operations. Please see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16. Discontinued Operations\u201d of this report.\nIn addition, the consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared from Huntsman's historical accounting records through the separation and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if our operations had been conducted separately from Huntsman; however, prior to the separation, we did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the periods presented and, as such, the consolidated and combined financial statements reflecting balances and activity prior to the separation, may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company.\nFor purposes of these consolidated and combined financial statements, all significant transactions with Huntsman International have been included in group equity. All intercompany transactions within the consolidated and combined business have been eliminated.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products.\nRecent Developments\nPotential Acquisition of Tronox European Paper Laminates Business\nOn July 16, 2018, we announced that we reached an agreement with Tronox Limited ( Tronox\u201d) to purchase the European paper laminates business (the 8120 Grade\u201d) from Tronox upon the closing of their proposed merger with The National Titanium Dioxide Company Limited (\"Cristal\"). In connection with the acquisition, Tronox would supply the 8120 Grade to us under a Transitional Supply Agreement until the transfer of the manufacturing of the 8120 Grade to our Greatham, U.K., facility has been completed.\nPori Fire\nOn January 30, 2017, our TiO2 manufacturing facility in Pori, Finland, experienced fire damage. The loss was covered by insurance for property damage as well as business interruption losses subject to retained deductibles of $15 million and 60 days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $371 million of income related to insurance recoveries in cost of goods sold while $187 million was recognized in 2017. The Pori facility had a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons per year, which represented approximately 17% of our total TiO2 nameplate capacity and approximately 2% of total global TiO2 demand. Prior to the fire, 60% of the site capacity produced specialty products which, on average, contributed greater than 75% of the site EBITDA from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2017. We have restored 20% of the total prior capacity, which is dedicated to production of specialty products.\nOn September 12, 2018, following our review of the Pori facility and options within our manufacturing network, and as a result of unanticipated cost escalation and extended timeline associated with reconstruction, we announced that we intend to close our Pori, Finland, TiO2 manufacturing facility and transfer the specialty and differentiated product grades to other sites. We intend to continue to operate the Pori facility at reduced production rates through the transition period, which is expected to last through at least 2022, subject to economic and other factors. We currently plan to transfer certain technology and the production of select product grades, namely for inks, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food grade applications, from Pori to other sites within our network. In addition, and as market conditions warrant, we intend to strengthen the existing manufacturing network by increasing its efficiency and by providing greater manufacturing flexibility. Please see \"Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-We may be unsuccessful in our announced intentions to close the Pori, Finland site and transfer specialty and differentiated production to other sites within our manufacturing network within the anticipated timeframe and we may not experience the full anticipated benefits of our transfer and strengthen program.\"\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nIn 2019, we expect results in our Titanium Dioxide segment to reflect: (i) soft near-term demand largely as a result of customer destocking; (ii) regional disparities in TiO2 pricing trends reflecting specific supply and demand balances; (iii) soft economic environment in China and Europe, including the direct and indirect effects of Brexit; (iv) manageable raw material and energy cost increases; (v) seasonal improvement in volumes in the first half of 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018; (vi) increased production of specialty and differentiated product grades; and (vii) additional cost improvement actions. In our Performance Additives segment, we expect near-term business trends to be driven by: (i) a seasonal improvement in sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2018; (ii) continued pricing momentum; (iii) softer economic conditions in China and Europe; (iv) increased raw material and energy costs; and (v) additional cost improvement actions.\nWe completed the actions to deliver the fixed cost reduction target as part of our 2017 Business Improvement Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. The full $60 million run rate benefit is expected to be captured in the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019 we announced additional cost reduction initiatives which are expected to provide approximately $40 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefit compared to 2018. Actions are expected to be complete in 2020 ending 2020 at the full run rate level.\nIn 2019, we expect to spend approximately $130 million on capital expenditures, which includes spending to transfer our specialty technology from Pori to other sites in our manufacturing network.\nWe expect our corporate and other costs will be approximately $50 million in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nThe

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before interest expense, net, income tax benefit (expense) from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) net income of discontinued operations, net of tax; (e) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; and (i) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. \nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nNevertheless, our management recognizes that there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of us as compared to net income. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.\nIn addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.\n (2) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) significant changes to income tax valuation allowances; (e) net income of discontinued operations; (f) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (g) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (h) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (i) net plant incident (credits) costs; (j) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share reflects all potential dilutive ordinary shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. For the periods prior to our IPO, the average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share was based on the ordinary shares that were outstanding at the time of our IPO. \nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information. These measures exclude similar non-cash item as Adjusted EBITDA in order to assist our investors in comparing our performance from period to period and as such, bear similar risks as Adjusted EBITDA as documented in footnote (1) above. For that reason, adjusted net income and the related per share amounts, should not be considered in isolation and should be considered only to supplement analysis of U.S. GAAP results.\n (3) The income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We eliminated the effect of significant changes to income tax valuation allowances from our presentation of adjusted net income to allow investors to better compare our ongoing financial performance from period to period. We do not adjust for insignificant changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under U.S. GAAP. \n (4) As presented within Item 7, operating expense includes selling. general and administrative expenses and other operating expense (income), net. \nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net loss was $157 million on revenues of $2,265 million, compared with a net income of $144 million on revenues of $2,209 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $301 million in net income was the result of the following items:\n \u2022 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $56 million, or 3%, as compared with the same period in 2017. The increase was due to a $62 million, or 4%, increase in revenue in our Titanium Dioxide segment primarily due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by a $6 million, or 1%, decrease in revenue in our Performance Additives segment due primarily to decreases in volumes. See -Segment Analysis\u201d below. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $8 million, or 4%, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily resulting from reduced overhead costs. \n \u2022 Restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $628 million from $52 million for the same period in 2017. For more information concerning restructuring activities, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing and Transition Costs\u201d of this report. \n \u2022 Other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $33 million primarily as a result of the recognition of income in 2017 related to the change in the future payment to Huntsman pursuant to the tax matters agreement entered into as part of our separation. The change in future expected payment was due to the 2017 Tax Act's reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. \n \u2022 Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8 million compared to $50 million of income tax expense for the same period in 2017. Our income tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions.

The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in average selling price, a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and a 1% increase due to mix and other, offset by a 13% decrease in volumes. The increase in selling prices compared to the prior year reflects more favorable business conditions allowing for an increase in prices globally. Sales volumes decreased primarily due to customer destocking and lower availability of certain specialty product grades due, in part, to extended planned maintenance turnarounds, reduced operating rates at our Pori, Finland manufacturing facility and other plant closures as part of our restructuring programs. Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant and the impact of plants closed as part of our restructuring programs, sales volumes decreased by 9% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is primarily a result of improvements in pricing, $19 million of benefits as a result of our 2017 business improvement program, and the sale of $14 million of energy credits in 2018, offset by the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs and the impact of insurance proceeds received in 2017 to reimburse lost earnings from our Pori, Finland facility.\nPerformance Additives\nThe Performance Additives segment generated $599 million of revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, a decline of $6 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2017 resulting from a 4% decrease in volumes and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable impact of sales mix and other partially offset by a 3% increase in pricing and a 2% improvement from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The decline in volumes was primarily as a result of customer destocking in Functional Additives, the discontinuation of sales of certain Timber Treatment products to a large customer, and plant shutdowns in the second quarter of 2018 as part of our restructuring plans, while the increase in selling prices is as a result of price increases for certain products within Functional Additives, Color Pigments and Timber Treatment to offset higher raw material and energy costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Performance Additives segment decreased by $10 million, or 14%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher raw materials and energy costs, offset by higher average selling prices and $8 million of benefits from our 2017 business improvement program.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate and other represents expenses which are not allocated to our segments. Losses from Corporate and other were $43 million, or $21 million"
