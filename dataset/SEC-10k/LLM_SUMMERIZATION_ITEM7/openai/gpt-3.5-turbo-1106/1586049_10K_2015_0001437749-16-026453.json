    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOxford Immunotec Global PLC is a global, commercial-stage diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary tests for the management of immune-regulated conditions. Our proprietary T-SPOT technology platform allows us to measure the responses of specific immune cells to inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. Our current development activities are principally focused on four areas: chronic infections, transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory disease and immune-oncology. We believe these areas are particularly attractive for the development of diagnostic tests because they involve large patient populations and chronic conditions that present the opportunity for both initial diagnosis and additional testing to monitor the conditions. These immune-regulated conditions also tend to be characterized by wide variation in presentation and progression and often require expensive therapies, making diagnostic tests that can better categorize patients and inform treatment pathways particularly useful. We believe the sensitivity of our T-SPOT technology platform, which can measure T cell and innate immune cell responses at a single cell level well position us to bring new insights into the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of immune-regulated conditions.\nThe initial product we have developed using our T-SPOT technology platform is our T-SPOT.TB test, which is used to test for tuberculosis, or TB, infection. Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including the United States, where we have received premarket approval, or PMA, from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in Europe, where we have obtained a CE mark, as well as in Japan and China. Interferon-gamma release assays, or IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test have been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in at least 34 countries, including the United States, several European countries and Japan. In addition, we have established reimbursement for our test in the United States, as well as a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code that is unique to our test. Outside the United States, we have established reimbursement in several countries where reimbursement applies, including Japan, Switzerland and Germany. We have also established the cost-effectiveness of our test in several published studies.\nIn 2015, we announced the availability of two additional tests using the T-SPOT technology platform. The T-SPOT.CMV test, which is used to test for cytomegalovirus infection, or CMV, and the T-SPOT.PRT test, which is a panel of reactive T cells, became available in the United States as laboratory developed tests from the Company's Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment, or CLIA, certified and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited service laboratory in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests were CE marked in the European Union during the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell response to foreign tissue, or alloreactivity, and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies.\nWe also have several active development programs pertaining to new potential tests. The programs seek to exploit our T cell and innate immune measuring technology and span each of our four focus areas. Our development pipeline includes an assay to assess the overall competence of the T cell side of the immune system, products targeting autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as gout and Lyme disease, and an assay informing the efficacy of biologic therapies. We also continue to explore applications of our T-SPOT technology platform in the immune-oncology space. These products are in earlier stages of development. Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market any of our products, or if we obtain clearances that we will successfully commercialize any of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials.\nWe have incurred significant losses from inception and as of December 31, 2015 had an accumulated deficit of $146.3 million. We anticipate that our operating losses will continue for the next few years as we continue to invest to grow our customer base and invest in research and development to expand our product portfolio. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $62.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $49.5 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $38.8 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $24.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $22.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $8.7 million.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales associated with our T-SPOT technology platform via our direct sales force and also through distributors. Our T-SPOT.TB test is our first commercialized product based on this technology.\nRevenue mix\nWe currently offer our T-SPOT.TB test as both an in vitro diagnostic kit and a service. In the former, we sell test kits and associated accessories to distributors for resale and directly to institutions and laboratories that perform TB testing. In the latter, we have established clinical testing laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom, where we perform our T-SPOT.TB test on samples sent to us by customers. In these markets, we have found that many customers prefer to send samples to us rather than perform their own analysis on-site.\nIn 2015, we announced the availability of two additional tests using the T-SPOT technology platform. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests became available in the United States as laboratory developed tests from the Company's CLIA certified and CAP accredited service laboratory in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests were CE marked in the European Union during the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell alloreactivity and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies. Essentially no revenue was earned on the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests in 2015.\nOur U.S. business derived 96% of revenue from our service offering, as opposed to kit sales, for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which reflects our experience that U.S. customers prefer to send IGRA tests out for processing and analysis rather than run them in-house. For the majority of our U.S. customers in the hospital and public health segments, TB testing programs are funded primarily from institutional budgets. We receive payment from these customers according to our pre-negotiated prices. For other segments of the U.S. market, notably, for example, the physicians' office segment, third-party reimbursement is often available to cover the cost of our T-SPOT.TB test.\nOutside the United States, we derived 92%, 91% and 90% of our revenue from the sale of our in vitro diagnostic kits and associated accessories for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the majority of our customers outside the United States, we primarily negotiate pricing directly with our customers; our prices are influenced to some degree by the mechanism and level of funding our customers receive for performing tests for TB infection.\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue by geography\nWe have a direct sales force in the United States, certain European countries and Japan and market development personnel in China. During the third quarter of 2015, we modified the pricing aspects of our arrangement with our Japanese wholesaler and, as a result, price is now determinable upon shipment. Previously, price was determinable when the wholesaler dispatched the product. In parts of the world where we do not maintain a direct sales force, we market and sell our products through distributors. As a result, our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies. We intend to expand our sales force globally and establish additional distributor relationships outside of our direct markets to better access international markets.\nThe following table reflects product revenue by geography (United States, Europe and rest of world, or ROW, and Asia) and as a percentage of total product revenue, based on the billing address of our customers.\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe & ROW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2014, we created new subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, further expanding our presence in Asia. Diagnostic products such as ours are subject to periodic re-registration in China. We completed the re-registration process for our T-SPOT.TB test with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, effective December 11, 2014. The registration will remain in effect until 2019.\nCost of revenue and operating expenses\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue consists of direct labor expenses, including employee benefits and share-based compensation expenses, overhead expenses, material costs, cost of laboratory supplies, freight costs, royalties paid under license agreements, U.S. medical device excise tax and depreciation of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our cost of revenue represented 47%, 48% and 48%, respectively, of our total revenue.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Thus, the medical device excise tax will not apply to the Company's U.S. sales during the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2017.\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less total cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margins were 53%, 52% and 52%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The gross margin improvement was attributable to a reduction in material costs per test and efficiency from increased volume in our manufacturing operations and service laboratories, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and increased share-based compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014.\nWe expect our overall cost of revenue to increase as we continue to increase our volume of kits manufactured and tests performed. However, we also believe that through these increased volumes, we can achieve certain efficiencies in our manufacturing and laboratory operations that could help maintain or improve our overall margins.\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development efforts have historically focused on developing multiple new diagnostic tests that use our quantitative T cell measurement technology, including assays that would help transplant physicians better manage patients at risk of rejection and infection. We have expanded our research and development efforts since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2013 and, with the Boulder Diagnostics, Inc., or Boulder, acquisition in July 2014, we have expanded our research and development efforts to include the development of immunology-based assays for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions/diseases.\nOur research and development activities include performing research, development, clinical and regulatory activities and validating improvements to our technology and processes for the purposes of enhancing product performance. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, fees for contractual and consulting services, clinical trial costs, travel costs, laboratory supplies, amortization, depreciation, rent, insurance and repairs and maintenance. We have supported the continued growth of our T-SPOT.TB business and expanded the team focused on the development of new products through management of clinical trial programs. In addition, we are expanding our research and development efforts in the United Kingdom and in Memphis, Tennessee. We expense all research and development costs as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses represented 18%, 14% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue. These increases were primarily related to clinical trials, including the PROTECT clinical trial, which is a pivotal clinical trial designed to demonstrate the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests, and the REACT clinical trial, which focuses on the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV test for stem cell transplant patients. The increases also include development project expenses related to our transplant program, the hiring of personnel in the United States to support development programs and projects acquired in the Boulder acquisition. During the third quarter of 2015, the timeline for the development of an assay to inform decisions regarding biologic therapies that was acquired as part of the Boulder acquisition was changed due to delays in the completion of research studies. Based upon the changed timeline and the resulting impact on fair value, we recorded a non-cash in-process research and development, or IPR&D, impairment charge of $385,000 in research and development expense.\nSales and marketing expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct sales force and sales management, and our marketing, customer service and business development personnel. These expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses and employee benefits for these personnel, including share-based compensation, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, customer service activities, medical education activities and overhead expenses. We expense all sales and marketing costs as incurred.\nWe continue to expand our operations in Asia. During 2014, we established two new subsidiaries in Asia: Oxford Immunotec Asia Limited, located in Hong Kong, and Oxford Immunotec (Shanghai) Medical Device Co. Ltd., located in Shanghai.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our sales and marketing expenses represented 49%, 51% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect our sales and marketing costs to increase, as we expand our sales force, business development activities, geographic presence and marketing and medical education programs to increase awareness and adoption of our current T-SPOT.TB test and future products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and finance, legal, information technology, or IT, and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses and employee benefits for the personnel included in these functions, including share-based compensation and travel costs, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, costs related to our Board of Directors, general corporate costs, overhead expenses and bad debt expense. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our general and administrative expenses represented 26%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. Although general and administrative expense has declined in 2015 as a percentage of revenue, spending has increased in absolute terms largely as a result of higher salary costs, partially offset by lower legal costs.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest expense, net, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other income and expense items.\nMonetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the period-end closing rate with resulting unrealized exchange fluctuations. Realized exchange fluctuations result from the settlement of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. The functional currencies of our businesses are U.S. Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euros, Yen and the Yuan, depending on the entity.\nResults of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts of certain components of our statements of operations and the percentage of total revenue represented by these items,

$49.5 million for the same period in 2014. This increase in revenue was due to an increase in volumes across all regions where we sell our T-SPOT.TB test. U.S. revenue grew by 39%, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, driven by growth of $5.4 million from the addition of new customers and $3.4 million from existing customers. Asia revenue grew by 23%, to $24.4 million, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to higher revenue in Japan and China. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Asia would have increased by 33%. Europe & ROW revenue decreased by 2%, to $7.1 million, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to changes in currency rates. On a constant currency basis, Europe & ROW revenue would have increased by 10% in 2015 compared to 2014.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe & ROW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(152 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue increased by 23% to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24.0 million in the same period of 2014. This increase in cost of revenue was due to the increased volume of kits sold and an increase in volume of tests performed by our laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom. Gross margin for 2015 increased to 52.9% from 51.5% for 2014. The gross margin improvement was attributable to a reduction in material costs per test and efficiency from increased volume in our manufacturing operations and service laboratories, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and increased share-based compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014.\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 56% to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $7.0 million for the same period in 2014. This increase reflects the fact that in 2014 we were just beginning to ramp-up our research and development activities following completion of our IPO in late 2013. The increased spending has primarily related to development project expenses for our transplant program and to the hiring of personnel in the United States to support development programs. In addition, with the acquisition of Boulder in the third quarter of 2014, we have expanded our research efforts to include assays for Lyme disease and gout.\nSalary costs increased $2.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the expansion of our research and development teams, and the cost of clinical studies increased $1.1 million. In addition, during the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash IPR&D impairment charge of $385,000 related to the Boulder acquisition in research and development expense. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses increased to 18% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 14% for the same period in 2014.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased 19% to $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $25.5 million for the same period in 2014. The increase reflects additional sales, marketing, and customer service personnel and the expansion of marketing programs. Salary costs increased $5.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition, travel costs increased $442,000, and symposia costs increased $309,000. These increases were partially offset by an $815,000 decrease in market research costs, reflecting one-time market research studies completed in 2014, and a $624,000 decrease in recruiting and hiring costs. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 48% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 51% for the same period in 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 8% to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase included increases of $1.5 million in salary costs, $157,000 for recruiting and hiring costs, $109,000 for administrative expenses and $90,000 in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $754,000 decrease in legal and professional fees in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 26% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 30% for the same period in 2014.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net was $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $52,000 in the same period in 2014. Interest expense in both periods primarily related to the fit out of our Marlborough facility.\nForeign exchange losses\nWe recorded foreign exchange losses of $143,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a net result of U.S. Dollar denominated bank accounts, accounts receivable and accounts payable reflected on the books of Oxford Immunotec Limited, which has a functional currency of the U.K. Pound Sterling. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded foreign exchange losses of $352,000. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk because we currently operate in three major regions of the world: the United States, Europe & ROW and Asia, and our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies. Approximately 50% of our sales were in the United States, which are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Sales in China are denominated in U.S. Dollars but these sales are made by our United Kingdom-based subsidiary where the Pound Sterling is the functional currency. As a result, these sales are subject to remeasurement into Pounds Sterling and then translation into U.S. Dollars when we consolidate our financial statements. Sales in Europe are denominated primarily in the Pound Sterling and Euro. As we grow Europe & ROW sales outside the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, we may be subject to risk from additional currencies. Sales in Japan are denominated in Yen.\nOur expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Europe and China.\nAs we continue to grow our business outside the United States, our results of operations and cash flows will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could harm our business in the future. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, although we may do so in the future.\nOther income\nOther income was $54,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $245,000 in the same period in 2014. Other income for 2015 consisted largely of grant income of $168,000, partially offset by severance expense of $112,000. Other income in 2014 consisted largely of a $149,000 U.K. research grant and an $83,000 Tennessee FastTrack Job Training Assistance program.\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe

compared to $38.8 million for the same period in 2013. This increase in revenue was due to an increase in volumes across all regions where we sell our T-SPOT.TB test. Asia revenue grew by 38%, to $19.7 million, compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to higher revenue in China and Japan. U.S. revenue grew by 30%, to $22.5 million, compared to the same period in 2013, driven by growth of $2.5 million from the addition of new customers and $2.7 million from existing customers. Europe & ROW revenue grew by 1%, to $7.2 million, compared to the same period in 2013.\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe & ROW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue increased by 29% to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $18.6 million in the same period in 2013. This increase in cost of revenue was due to the increased volume of kits sold and an increase in volume of tests sold through our laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom. Gross margin for 2014 was 51.5% compared to 52.0% for 2013. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to currency effects, the impact of share-based compensation included in cost of revenue and investments to increase capacity in our service lab, offset by underlying improvements in reducing kit costs and streamlining service operations in our laboratories.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 228% to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.1 million for the same period in 2013. This increase was primarily related to development project expenses related to our transplant program and to the hiring of personnel in the United States to support development programs. In addition, with the acquisition of Boulder in the third quarter of 2014, we have expanded our research efforts to include assays for Lyme disease and gout and an assay to inform decisions regarding biologic therapies. In addition, we restructured the operations of Boulder to integrate them into our existing operations. This restructuring, which included the termination of 4 employees, the relocation of 3 employees, the closing of excess facilities, and related costs, resulted in a restructuring charge of $182,000 that was recorded in research and development expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses increased to 14% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 6% for the same period in 2013.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased 92% to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $13.3 million for the same period in 2013. The increase reflected an increase in sales personnel and in personnel-related costs for commissions on increased sales and for hiring of sales, marketing, administrative and technical support personnel. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased to 51% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 34% for the same period in 2013.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 22% to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $12.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase reflected the increased regulatory costs of being a public company and increases in personnel-related costs associated with increases in our legal, accounting and finance, IT, corporate development and human resources headcount, and consulting costs to support our growth. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 30% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 31% for the same period in 2013.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net was $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $328,000 in the same period in 2013. The 2014 expense consisted primarily of interest expense relating to the fit out of our Marlborough facility. The 2013 expense consisted primarily of interest expense on our term debt and revolving credit facilities. We repaid the borrowings under our credit facility with Comerica Bank in May 2013 and entered into a new term loan and revolving line of credit with Square 1 Bank. This loan was repaid and the credit facility cancelled in December 2013, following our IPO.\nForeign exchange gains (losses)\nWe recorded foreign exchange losses of $352,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a net result of U.S. Dollar denominated bank accounts, accounts receivable, and accounts payable reflected on the books of Oxford Immunotec Limited, which has a functional currency of the U.K. Pound Sterling, as the Pound rose against the Dollar for the first six months of 2014 before falling in the second half of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded foreign exchange losses of $423,000 as a net result of U.S. Dollar denominated bank accounts, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and loans payable on the books of Oxford Immunotec Limited, as the Pound increased versus the Dollar. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk because we currently operate in three major regions of the world: the United States, Europe & ROW, and Asia, our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies. Approximately 46% of our sales were in the United States, which are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Sales in China are denominated in U.S. Dollars but these sales are made by our United Kingdom-based subsidiary where the Pound Sterling is the functional currency. As a result, these sales are subject to remeasurement into Pounds Sterling and then translation into U.S. Dollars when we consolidate our financial statements. Sales in Europe are denominated primarily in the Pound Sterling and Euro. As we grow Europe & ROW sales outside the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone, we may be subject to risk from additional currencies. Sales in Japan are denominated in Yen, and our sales in Japan, which started in late 2012, grew significantly in 2013 and continued to grow in 2014.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income was $245,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to other expense of $470,000 in the same period in 2013. Other income in 2014 consisted largely of a $149,000 U.K. research grant and an $83,000 Tennessee FastTrack Job Training Assistance program. Other expense in 2013 consisted largely of a loss on the change in fair value of warrants.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSources of funds\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015 we had a net loss of $24.5 million and used $16.5 million of cash for operating activities. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $146.3 million. We incurred a net loss of $22.2 million and used $20.8 million of cash for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOn January 29, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement with a group of underwriters, relating to an offering of 4,255,319 ordinary shares, nominal value \u00a30.006705, or the Shares, at an Offering Price to the public of $11.75 per Share. The underwriters agreed to purchase the Shares from us pursuant to an underwriting agreement at a price of $11.045 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 638,297 option shares at the Offering Price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On January 30, 2015, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase the option shares in full. The gross proceeds to us from the sale of the Shares and the option shares were approximately $57.5 million and we received net proceeds of approximately $53.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and aggregate offering expenses payable by us. The Offering closed on February 4, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $83.7 million.\nCredit facilities\nThe Company had no available credit facilities as of December 31, 2015.\nSummary of cash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of and for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,165 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,549 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,777 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,122 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(436 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(374 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,329 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $16.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a net loss of $24.5 million, non-cash items of $6.3 million and cash provided by changes in operating assets less liabilities of $1.6 million.

The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was largely due to the timing of payments. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets reflected the timing of certain payments and inventory increased in anticipation of growing revenue. The increase in accounts receivable, net primarily reflected increased revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the timing of receipts.

We expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to invest to grow our customer base, expand our marketing and distribution channels, hire additional employees and increase product development expenditures. Additionally, as a public company, we incur significant audit, legal and other expenses.

Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue recognition and accounts receivable\nWe derive revenue from the sale of our diagnostic tests to a broad range of customers including hospitals, public health departments, commercial testing laboratories, importers and distributors. We offer our T-SPOT.TB test in either an in vitro diagnostic kit or a service format.\nRevenue from tests is generally paid directly by the customer and is recognized on the accrual basis when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) the kit has been shipped or delivered or, in the case of tests performed in our laboratory, when final results have been reported to the customer; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn the United States, we also generate revenue from payments that are received from a variety of third-party payors, including government programs (Medicare and Medicaid) and commercial insurance companies, each with different billing requirements. Revenue from tests paid by third-party payors is recognized on an accrual basis based on our historical collection experience.\nAccounts receivable are primarily amounts due from hospitals, public health departments, commercial testing laboratories, distributors and universities in addition to third party payors such as commercial insurance companies (including managed care organizations), government programs (Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and individual patients.\nAccounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The process of estimating the collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments. Specifically, the accounts receivable allowance is based on management's analysis of current and past due accounts, collection experience in relation to amounts billed, channel mix, any specific customer collection issues that have been identified and other relevant information. Our provision for uncollectible accounts is recorded as bad debt expense and included in general and administrative expenses. Although we believe amounts provided are adequate, the ultimate amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable could be in excess of the amounts provided.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires, among other things, that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses, or NOLs, and research and development credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe follow the accounting guidance for uncertainties in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return in the financial statements. Additionally, the guidance also prescribes the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. We accrue for the estimated amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that we would be required to pay such additional taxes. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax positions, and there were no such interest or penalties recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nShare-based compensation\nShare-based compensation relates to grants of options to purchase ordinary shares and restricted shares. Currently, we maintain one share incentive plan pursuant to which we may grant options to purchase our ordinary shares, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other share-based awards to our employees, directors and officers. This incentive plan is called the Oxford Immunotec Global PLC 2013 Share Incentive Plan, or the 2013 Plan. In addition, we maintain the 2008 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2008 Plan. No new share grants or awards will be made under the 2008 Plan.\nWe measure the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date on which they are granted. Estimating fair value for options requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model, including the expected life of the award, volatility and dividend yield, and making certain assumptions about the award. Share-based compensation expense for restricted shares is calculated based on the grant date market price of the shares and is recognized over the vesting period.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the share option awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including assumptions about the expected life of share-based payment awards and share price volatility. In addition, when we were a private company, one of the most subjective inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model was the estimated fair value of our ordinary shares. Due to the lack of an adequate history of a public market for the trading of our ordinary shares and a lack of adequate company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the share-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our share-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available.\nWe determine the expected term for share option grants to employees based on the simplified\u201d method prescribed under Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14: Share-based Payments. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is a weighted-average assumption equivalent to the expected term based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect as of the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the share-based payment awards represent our best estimate and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, we recognize expense based on the share option grant's pre-defined vesting schedule over the requisite service period using the straight-line method for all employee share options. In addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the share options, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all share-based awards and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest. The estimation of the number of share awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised. We consider multiple factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee position and historical employee turnover data. During the period in which the share options vest, we will record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate and a recovery of expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated.\nBusiness Combinations\nFor acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods.\nWhen determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we estimate the cost using the most appropriate valuation method with assistance from independent third party specialists. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we use judgment to estimate the applicable discount rate, growth rates and the timing and amount of future cash flows. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by management using the assistance of independent third party specialists. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets represent our best estimates. If factors change and we were to use different assumptions, valuations of tangible and intangible assets and the resulting goodwill balance related to the business combination could be materially different.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that all, or a portion, of the carrying value of the reporting unit may no longer be recoverable, using the two-step impairment review. Under this method, we compare the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a more detailed analysis is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired. An impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the fair value of goodwill. We also have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that goodwill is impaired. If we choose to first assess qualitative factors and it is determined that it is not more likely than not goodwill is impaired, we are not required to take further action to test for impairment. We also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform only the quantitative impairment test, which we may choose to do in some periods but not in others.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of acquired IPR&D related to our business combination with Boulder, which were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. IPR&D intangible assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. IPR&D is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test to determine the fair value. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over its fair value. We also have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that our indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we choose to first assess qualitative factors and it is determined that it is not more likely than not our indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we are not required to take further action to test for impairment. We also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform only the quantitative impairment test, which we may choose to do in some periods but not in others. The determinations as to whether, and, if so, the extent to which, acquired IPR&D become impaired are highly judgmental and based on significant assumptions regarding the projected future financial condition and operating results, changes in the manner of the use and development of the acquired assets, our overall business strategy, and regulatory, market and economic environment and trends.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for any other contractually narrow or limited purpose.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09, which converges the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board standards on revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09, a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The guidance allows for either full retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating ASU 2014-09 and have not yet determined how it may impact our financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, or ASU 2014-15. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application is permitted. ASU 2014-15 requires that management evaluate at each annual and interim reporting period whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. We do not expect that the application of ASU 2014-15 will have an impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nIn November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging, or ASU 2014-16. The objective of ASU 2014-16 is to eliminate the existing diversity in practice in accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. A hybrid financial instrument consists of a host contract\u201d into which one or more derivative terms have been embedded. ASU 2014-16 requires an entity to consider the terms and features of the entire financial instrument, including the embedded derivative features, in order to determine whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity. ASU 2014-16 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. A reporting entity should apply ASU 2014-16 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 on January 1, 2015 had no impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items, or ASU 2015-01. ASU 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. However, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The amendments in ASU 2015-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2015 had no impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, or ASU 2015-05. ASU 2015-05 amends existing accounting guidance to provide explicit guidance related to a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Under the guidance, cloud computing arrangements that include a software license would be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Conversely, cloud computing arrangements that do not include a software license would be accounted for as a service contract. This guidance will be effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the application of ASU 2015-05 will have an impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, or ASU 2015-11. ASU 2015-11 requires that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This guidance will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 are to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect that the application of ASU 2015-11 will have a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement to bifurcate deferred taxes between current and non-current on the balance sheet and requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments for ASU 2015-17 can be applied retrospectively or prospectively and early adoption is permitted. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 prospectively. We do not expect ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or disclosures.\nUnder the U.S. Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies that become public can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.",

    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOxford Immunotec Global PLC is a global, commercial-stage diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary tests for the management of immune-regulated conditions. Our proprietary T-SPOT technology platform allows us to measure the responses of specific immune cells to inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. Our current development activities are principally focused on four areas: chronic infections, transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory disease and immune-oncology. We believe these areas are particularly attractive for the development of diagnostic tests because they involve large patient populations and chronic conditions that present the opportunity for both initial diagnosis and additional testing to monitor the conditions. These immune-regulated conditions also tend to be characterized by wide variation in presentation and progression and often require expensive therapies, making diagnostic tests that can better categorize patients and inform treatment pathways particularly useful. We believe the sensitivity of our T-SPOT technology platform, which can measure T cell and innate immune cell responses at a single cell level well position us to bring new insights into the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of immune-regulated conditions.\nThe initial product we have developed using our T-SPOT technology platform is our T-SPOT.TB test, which is used to test for tuberculosis, or TB, infection. Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including the United States, where we have received premarket approval, or PMA, from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in Europe, where we have obtained a CE mark, as well as in Japan and China. Interferon-gamma release assays, or IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test have been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in at least 34 countries, including the United States, several European countries and Japan. In addition, we have established reimbursement for our test in the United States, as well as a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code that is unique to our test. Outside the United States, we have established reimbursement in several countries where reimbursement applies, including Japan, Switzerland and Germany. We have also established the cost-effectiveness of our test in several published studies.\nIn 2015, we announced the availability of two additional tests using the T-SPOT technology platform. The T-SPOT.CMV test, which is used to test for cytomegalovirus infection, or CMV, and the T-SPOT.PRT test, which is a panel of reactive T cells, became available in the United States as laboratory developed tests from the Company's Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment, or CLIA, certified and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited service laboratory in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests were CE marked in the European Union during the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell response to foreign tissue, or alloreactivity, and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies.\nWe also have several active development programs pertaining to new potential tests. The programs seek to exploit our T cell and innate immune measuring technology and span each of our four focus areas. Our development pipeline includes an assay to assess the overall competence of the T cell side of the immune system, products targeting autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as gout and Lyme disease, and an assay informing the efficacy of biologic therapies. We also continue to explore applications of our T-SPOT technology platform in the immune-oncology space. These products are in earlier stages of development. Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market any of our products, or if we obtain clearances that we will successfully commercialize any of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials.\nWe have incurred significant losses from inception and as of December 31, 2015 had an accumulated deficit of $146.3 million. We anticipate that our operating losses will continue for the next few years as we continue to invest to grow our customer base and invest in research and development to expand our product portfolio. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $62.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $49.5 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $38.8 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $24.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $22.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $8.7 million.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales associated with our T-SPOT technology platform via our direct sales force and also through distributors. Our T-SPOT.TB test is our first commercialized product based on this technology.\nRevenue mix\nWe currently offer our T-SPOT.TB test as both an in vitro diagnostic kit and a service. In the former, we sell test kits and associated accessories to distributors for resale and directly to institutions and laboratories that perform TB testing. In the latter, we have established clinical testing laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom, where we perform our T-SPOT.TB test on samples sent to us by customers. In these markets, we have found that many customers prefer to send samples to us rather than perform their own analysis on-site.\nIn 2015, we announced the availability of two additional tests using the T-SPOT technology platform. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests became available in the United States as laboratory developed tests from the Company's CLIA certified and CAP accredited service laboratory in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests were CE marked in the European Union during the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell alloreactivity and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies. Essentially no revenue was earned on the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests in 2015.\nOur U.S. business derived 96% of revenue from our service offering, as opposed to kit sales, for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which reflects our experience that U.S. customers prefer to send IGRA tests out for processing and analysis rather than run them in-house. For the majority of our U.S. customers in the hospital and public health segments, TB testing programs are funded primarily from institutional budgets. We receive payment from these customers according to our pre-negotiated prices. For other segments of the U.S. market, notably, for example, the physicians' office segment, third-party reimbursement is often available to cover the cost of our T-SPOT.TB test.\nOutside the United States, we derived 92%, 91% and 90% of our revenue from the sale of our in vitro diagnostic kits and associated accessories for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the majority of our customers outside the United States, we primarily negotiate pricing directly with our customers; our prices are influenced to some degree by the mechanism and level of funding our customers receive for performing tests for TB infection.\n\nRevenue by geography\nWe have a direct sales force in the United States, certain European countries and Japan and market development personnel in China. During the third quarter of 2015, we modified the pricing aspects of our arrangement with our Japanese wholesaler and, as a result, price is now determinable upon shipment. Previously, price was determinable when the wholesaler dispatched the product. In parts of the world where we do not maintain a direct sales force, we market and sell our products through distributors. As a result, our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies. We intend to expand our sales force globally and establish additional distributor relationships outside of our direct markets to better access international markets.\nThe following table reflects product revenue by geography (United States, Europe and rest of world, or ROW, and Asia) and as a percentage of total product revenue, based on the billing address of our customers.\n\nIn 2014, we created new subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, further expanding our presence in Asia. Diagnostic products such as ours are subject to periodic re-registration in China. We completed the re-registration process for our T-SPOT.TB test with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, effective December 11, 2014. The registration will remain in effect until 2019.\nCost of revenue and operating expenses\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue consists of direct labor expenses, including employee benefits and share-based compensation expenses, overhead expenses, material costs, cost of laboratory supplies, freight costs, royalties paid under license agreements, U.S. medical device excise tax and depreciation of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our cost of revenue represented 47%, 48% and 48%, respectively, of our total revenue.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Thus, the medical device excise tax will not apply to the Company's U.S. sales during the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2017.\n\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less total cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margins were 53%, 52% and 52%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The gross margin improvement was attributable to a reduction in material costs per test and efficiency from increased volume in our manufacturing operations and service laboratories, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and increased share-based compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014.\nWe expect our overall cost of revenue to increase as we continue to increase our volume of kits manufactured and tests performed. However, we also believe that through these increased volumes, we can achieve certain efficiencies in our manufacturing and laboratory operations that could help maintain or improve our overall margins.\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development efforts have historically focused on developing multiple new diagnostic tests that use our quantitative T cell measurement technology, including assays that would help transplant physicians better manage patients at risk of rejection and infection. We have expanded our research and development efforts since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2013 and, with the Boulder Diagnostics, Inc., or Boulder, acquisition in July 2014, we have expanded our research and development efforts to include the development of immunology-based assays for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions/diseases.\nOur research and development activities include performing research, development, clinical and regulatory activities and validating improvements to our technology and processes for the purposes of enhancing product performance. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, fees for contractual and consulting services, clinical trial costs, travel costs, laboratory supplies, amortization, depreciation, rent, insurance and repairs and maintenance. We have supported the continued growth of our T-SPOT.TB business and expanded the team focused on the development of new products through management of clinical trial programs. In addition, we are expanding our research and development efforts in the United Kingdom and in Memphis, Tennessee. We expense all research and development costs as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses represented 18%, 14% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue. These increases were primarily related to clinical trials, including the PROTECT clinical trial, which is a pivotal clinical trial designed to demonstrate the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests, and the REACT clinical trial, which focuses on the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV test for stem cell transplant patients. The increases also include development project expenses related to our transplant program, the hiring of personnel in the United States to support development programs and projects acquired in the Boulder acquisition. During the third quarter of 2015, the timeline for the development of an assay to inform decisions regarding biologic therapies that was acquired as part of the Boulder acquisition was changed due to delays in the completion of research studies. Based upon the changed timeline and the resulting impact on fair value, we recorded a non-cash in-process research and development, or IPR&D, impairment charge of $385,000 in research and development expense.\nSales and marketing expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct sales force and sales management, and our marketing, customer service and business development personnel. These expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses and employee benefits for these personnel, including share-based compensation, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, customer service activities, medical education activities and overhead expenses. We expense all sales and marketing costs as incurred.\nWe continue to expand our operations in Asia. During 2014, we established two new subsidiaries in Asia: Oxford Immunotec Asia Limited, located in Hong Kong, and Oxford Immunotec (Shanghai) Medical Device Co. Ltd., located in Shanghai.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our sales and marketing expenses represented 49%, 51% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect our sales and marketing costs to increase, as we expand our sales force, business development activities, geographic presence and marketing and medical education programs to increase awareness and adoption of our current T-SPOT.TB test and future products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and finance, legal, information technology, or IT, and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses and employee benefits for the personnel included in these functions, including share-based compensation and travel costs, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, costs related to our Board of Directors, general corporate costs, overhead expenses and bad debt expense. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our general and administrative expenses represented 26%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. Although general and administrative expense has declined in 2015 as a percentage of revenue, spending has increased in absolute terms largely as a result of higher salary costs, partially offset by lower legal costs.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest expense, net, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other income and expense items.\nMonetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the period-end closing rate with resulting unrealized exchange fluctuations. Realized exchange fluctuations result from the settlement of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. The functional currencies of our businesses are U.S. Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euros, Yen and the Yuan, depending on the entity.\nResults of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts of certain components of our statements of operations and the percentage of total revenue represented by these items, showing period-to-period changes.\n\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by 27% to $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $49.5 million for the same period in 2014. This increase in revenue was due to an increase in volumes across all regions where we sell our T-SPOT.TB test. U.S. revenue grew by 39%, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, driven by growth of $5.4 million from the addition of new customers and $3.4 million from existing customers. Asia revenue grew by 23%, to $24.4 million, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to higher revenue in Japan and China. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Asia would have increased by 33%. Europe & ROW revenue decreased by 2%, to $7.1 million, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to changes in currency rates. On a constant currency basis, Europe & ROW revenue would have increased by 10% in 2015 compared to 2014.\n",

The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell response to foreign tissue, or alloreactivity, and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies.\nWe also have several active development programs pertaining to new potential tests. The programs seek to exploit our T cell and innate immune measuring technology and span each of our four focus areas. Our development pipeline includes an assay to assess the overall competence of the T cell side of the immune system, products targeting autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as gout and Lyme disease, and an assay informing the efficacy of biologic therapies. We also continue to explore applications of our T-SPOT technology platform in the immune-oncology space. These products are in earlier stages of development. Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market any of our products, or if we obtain clearances that we will successfully commercialize any of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials.\nWe have incurred significant losses from inception and as of December 31, 2015 had an accumulated deficit of $146.3 million. We anticipate that our operating losses will continue for the next few years as we continue to invest to grow our customer base and invest in research and development to expand our product portfolio. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $62.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $49.5 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $38.8 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $24.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $22.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $8.7 million.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from sales associated with our T-SPOT technology platform via our direct sales force and also through distributors. Our T-SPOT.TB test is our first commercialized product based on this technology.\nRevenue mix\nWe currently offer our T-SPOT.TB test as both an in vitro diagnostic kit and a service. In the former, we sell test kits and associated accessories to distributors for resale and directly to institutions and laboratories that perform TB testing. In the latter, we have established clinical testing laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom, where we perform our T-SPOT.TB test on samples sent to us by customers. In these markets, we have found that many customers prefer to send samples to us rather than perform their own analysis on-site.\nIn 2015, we announced the availability of two additional tests using the T-SPOT technology platform. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests became available in the United States as laboratory developed tests from the Company's CLIA certified and CAP accredited service laboratory in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests were CE marked in the European Union during the second and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. The T-SPOT.CMV test measures the strength of a patient's cellular immune response to CMV specific antigens and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. The T-SPOT.PRT test assesses a solid organ transplant candidate's T cell alloreactivity and may help clinicians identify patients at increased risk of T cell mediated rejection post-transplant. While we are enthusiastic about the potential utility that the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests may provide in transplant medicine, we are taking a measured approach to market introduction as we await the results of two pivotal clinical studies. Essentially no revenue was earned on the T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests in 2015.\nOur U.S. business derived 96% of revenue from our service offering, as opposed to kit sales, for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which reflects our experience that U.S. customers prefer to send IGRA tests out for processing and analysis rather than run them in-house. For the majority of our U.S. customers in the hospital and public health segments, TB testing programs are funded primarily from institutional budgets. We receive payment from these customers according to our pre-negotiated prices. For other segments of the U.S. market, notably, for example, the physicians' office segment, third-party reimbursement is often available to cover the cost of our T-SPOT.TB test.\nOutside the United States, we derived 92%, 91% and 90% of our revenue from the sale of our in vitro diagnostic kits and associated accessories for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the majority of our customers outside the United States, we primarily negotiate pricing directly with our customers; our prices are influenced to some degree by the mechanism and level of funding our customers receive for performing tests for TB infection.\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue by geography\nWe have a direct sales force in the United States, certain European countries and Japan and market development personnel in China. During the third quarter of 2015, we modified the pricing aspects of our arrangement with our Japanese wholesaler and, as a result, price is now determinable upon shipment. Previously, price was determinable when the wholesaler dispatched the product. In parts of the world where we do not maintain a direct sales force, we market and sell our products through distributors. As a result, our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies. We intend to expand our sales force globally and establish additional distributor relationships outside of our direct markets to better access international markets.\nThe following table reflects product revenue by geography (United States, Europe and rest of world, or ROW, and Asia) and as a percentage of total product revenue, based on the billing address of our customers.\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe & ROW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2014, we created new subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, further expanding our presence in Asia. Diagnostic products such as ours are subject to periodic re-registration in China. We completed the re-registration process for our T-SPOT.TB test with the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, effective December 11, 2014. The registration will remain in effect until 2019.\nCost of revenue and operating expenses\nCost of revenue and gross margin\nCost of revenue consists of direct labor expenses, including employee benefits and share-based compensation expenses, overhead expenses, material costs, cost of laboratory supplies, freight costs, royalties paid under license agreements, U.S. medical device excise tax and depreciation of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our cost of revenue represented 47%, 48% and 48%, respectively, of our total revenue.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Thus, the medical device excise tax will not apply to the Company's U.S. sales during the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2017.\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur gross profit represents total revenue less total cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margins were 53%, 52% and 52%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The gross margin improvement was attributable to a reduction in material costs per test and efficiency from increased volume in our manufacturing operations and service laboratories, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and increased share-based compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014.\nWe expect our overall cost of revenue to increase as we continue to increase our volume of kits manufactured and tests performed. However, we also believe that through these increased volumes, we can achieve certain efficiencies in our manufacturing and laboratory operations that could help maintain or improve our overall margins.\nResearch and development expenses\nOur research and development efforts have historically focused on developing multiple new diagnostic tests that use our quantitative T cell measurement technology, including assays that would help transplant physicians better manage patients at risk of rejection and infection. We have expanded our research and development efforts since our initial public offering, or IPO, in November 2013 and, with the Boulder Diagnostics, Inc., or Boulder, acquisition in July 2014, we have expanded our research and development efforts to include the development of immunology-based assays for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions/diseases.\nOur research and development activities include performing research, development, clinical and regulatory activities and validating improvements to our technology and processes for the purposes of enhancing product performance. Research and development expenses include personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, fees for contractual and consulting services, clinical trial costs, travel costs, laboratory supplies, amortization, depreciation, rent, insurance and repairs and maintenance. We have supported the continued growth of our T-SPOT.TB business and expanded the team focused on the development of new products through management of clinical trial programs. In addition, we are expanding our research and development efforts in the United Kingdom and in Memphis, Tennessee. We expense all research and development costs as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses represented 18%, 14% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue. These increases were primarily related to clinical trials, including the PROTECT clinical trial, which is a pivotal clinical trial designed to demonstrate the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV and T-SPOT.PRT tests, and the REACT clinical trial, which focuses on the clinical value of our T-SPOT.CMV test for stem cell transplant patients. The increases also include development project expenses related to our transplant program, the hiring of personnel in the United States to support development programs and projects acquired in the Boulder acquisition. During the third quarter of 2015, the timeline for the development of an assay to inform decisions regarding biologic therapies that was acquired as part of the Boulder acquisition was changed due to delays in the completion of research studies. Based upon the changed timeline and the resulting impact on fair value, we recorded a non-cash in-process research and development, or IPR&D, impairment charge of $385,000 in research and development expense.\nSales and marketing expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct sales force and sales management, and our marketing, customer service and business development personnel. These expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses and employee benefits for these personnel, including share-based compensation, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, customer service activities, medical education activities and overhead expenses. We expense all sales and marketing costs as incurred.\nWe continue to expand our operations in Asia. During 2014, we established two new subsidiaries in Asia: Oxford Immunotec Asia Limited, located in Hong Kong, and Oxford Immunotec (Shanghai) Medical Device Co. Ltd., located in Shanghai.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our sales and marketing expenses represented 49%, 51% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect our sales and marketing costs to increase, as we expand our sales force, business development activities, geographic presence and marketing and medical education programs to increase awareness and adoption of our current T-SPOT.TB test and future products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting and finance, legal, information technology, or IT, and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses and employee benefits for the personnel included in these functions, including share-based compensation and travel costs, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, costs related to our Board of Directors, general corporate costs, overhead expenses and bad debt expense. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our general and administrative expenses represented 26%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. Although general and administrative expense has declined in 2015 as a percentage of revenue, spending has increased in absolute terms largely as a result of higher salary costs, partially offset by lower legal costs.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest expense, net, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other income and expense items.\nMonetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the period-end closing rate with resulting unrealized exchange fluctuations. Realized exchange fluctuations result from the settlement of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our businesses. The functional currencies of our businesses are U.S. Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euros, Yen and the Yuan, depending on the entity.\nResults of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts of certain components of our statements of operations and the percentage of total revenue represented by these items,
