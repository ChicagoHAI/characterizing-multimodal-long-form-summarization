MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended November 1, 2015, November 2, 2014 and November 3, 2013\nOverview\nThe Company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers, and manufacturers of FPDs. Photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics, micro-electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications. The Company's selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications, particularly as they relate to the semiconductor industry's migration to more advanced product innovation, design methodologies and fabrication processes. The Company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products manufactured using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. However, the reduced use of customized ICs, reductions in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and FPDs increases. Advances in semiconductor, FPD and photomask design and semiconductor and FPD production methods that shift the burden of achieving device performance away from lithography could also reduce the demand for photomasks. Historically, the microelectronic industry has been volatile, experiencing periodic downturns and slowdowns in design activity. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices.\nThe Company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time, sometimes within 24 hours. This results in the Company having a minimal level of backlog orders, typically one to two weeks for IC photomasks and two to three weeks for FPD photomasks.\nThe global semiconductor industry, including mobile display devices, is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including, but not limited to, mobile communications and computing solutions.\nThe Company cannot predict the timing of the industry's transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy, but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future, beneficially and adversely affecting its business, financial condition and operating results as they occur. The Company believes its ability to remain successful in these environments is dependent upon its achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader and efficient solutions supplier, which it believes should enable it to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure.\nThe Company is focused on improving its competitiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs and, in connection therewith, has invested and plans to continue to invest in manufacturing equipment to serve the high-end market. As the Company continues to face challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness, it continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives.\nAs of December 2015 state-of-the-art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be 45 nanometer and lower for ICs and Generation 8 and above and AMOLED display based process technologies for FPDs. However, 65 nanometer and above geometries for semiconductors and Generation 7 and below, excluding AMOLED, process technologies for FPDs constitute the majority of designs currently being fabricated in volume. At these geometries, the Company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the Company's competitors that is not available to the Company. The Company expects 45 nanometer and below designs to continue to move to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal 2016, and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business as a result of its investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located.\nThe photomask industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. In order to remain competitive, the Company will be required to continually anticipate, respond to, and utilize changing technologies. In particular, the Company believes that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller, it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically-enhanced reticles, including optical proximity correction and phase-shift photomasks. Additionally, demand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks used, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field-programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs or the use of certain chip stacking methodologies that lessen the emphasis on conventional lithography technology. Furthermore, increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors. As of the end of fiscal 2015, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production, and the Company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of this or other alternative semiconductor design methodologies. However, should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring IC designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance, and the Company does not anticipate, respond to, or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource, technological or other constraints, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBoth revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high-end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities, but generally command higher average selling prices (\"ASPs\"). The Company's capital expenditure payments aggregated approximately $259 million for the three fiscal years ended November 1, 2015, which has significantly contributed to the Company's operating expenses. The Company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth, and expects capital expenditure payments to be between $50 million and $75 million in fiscal 2016.\nThe manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ICs and other related products built using comparable photomask-based process technologies has been, and continues to be, capital intensive. The Company's integrated global manufacturing network, which consists of nine manufacturing sites, and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base. Should sales volumes decrease as a result of a decrease in design releases from the Company's customers, the Company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins, or result in write-offs from asset impairments.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company announced that the MP Mask joint venture would not be renewed after May 5, 2016. The MP Mask operating agreement provides that Micron will make a payment to the Company to purchase the Company's equity interest in MP Mask based on the Company's ownership percentage of the net book value of MP Mask at that time, which, as of September 3, 2015, was approximately $93 million. The Company does not expect that it will incur a significant gain or loss on this transaction. Concurrently, the Company announced that it entered into supply and technology license agreements with Micron. This supply agreement, which commences on May 6, 2016, with a one-year term subject to mutually agreeable renewals, provides that the Company will be the majority outsource supplier of Micron's photomasks and related services. The technology license agreement commenced in March 2015 and continues through the earlier of one year from the termination of the initial technology license agreement, which will occur on May 5, 2016, or when Micron certifies that it has transferred certain defined technology to the Company. The Company forevermore has the rights to use the technology obtained under these technology license agreements.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company privately exchanged $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% convertible senior notes with a maturity date of April 1, 2016, for new 3.25% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million with a maturity date of April 1, 2019. The conversion rate of the new notes is the same as that of the exchanged notes, which were issued in March 2011 with a conversion rate of approximately 96 shares of common stock per $1,000 note principal, equivalent to a conversion price of $10.37 per share of common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which are described in the indenture dated January 22, 2015. Note holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2019, and the Company is not required to redeem the notes prior to their maturity date. Interest on the notes accrues in arrears, and is paid semiannually through the notes' maturity date.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired DPTT in a non-cash transaction that resulted in the Company owning 50.01% and DNP owning 49.99% of PDMC, whose financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. PDMC has generated sufficient cash flows to fund its operating and capital requirements. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company amended its credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2018, has a $50 million limit with an expansion capacity to $75 million, and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets located in the United States and common stock the Company owns in certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The credit facility is subject to a minimum interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balance financial covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at November 1, 2015. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit facility at November 1, 2015, and $50 million was available for borrowing. The interest rate on the credit facility (1.44% at November 1, 2015) is based on the Company's total leverage ratio at LIBOR plus a spread, as defined in the credit facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 a $26.4 million principal amount, five year capital lease commenced to fund the purchase of a high-end lithography tool. Payments under the lease, which bears interest at 2.77% are $0.5 million per month through July 2018. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company must maintain the equipment in good working order, and is subject to a cross default with a cross acceleration provision related to certain nonfinancial covenants incorporated in its credit facility. As of November 1, 2015, the total amount payable through the end of the lease term was $16.0 million, of which $15.3 million represents principal and $0.7 million represents interest.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company completed a tender offer for shares of PSMC. A total of 50.3 million shares were tendered at the offering price of 16.30 NTD (equivalent to a total of $27.4 million), which increased the Company's ownership interest in PSMC from 75.11% to 98.13%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company further increased its ownership interest in PSMC to 98.63% with the purchase of an additional 1.1 million shares of PSMC for $0.7 million, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired all of the 3.0 million shares that were then held by noncontrolling interests at a cost of $1.7 million. In April 2014 PSMC merged with DPTT to form PDMC.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2013 PSMC completed a stock repurchase plan that had been authorized by its board of directors in fiscal 2012. The completion of this repurchase plan resulted in the Company acquiring an additional 9.2 million shares at a cost $4.2 million, and increasing its ownership percentage in PSMC from 72.09% at October 28, 2012 to 75.11% as of January 27, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for 2015 increased 15.1% as compared with 2014. The increase was primarily a result of a full year impact of the acquisition of DPTT and increased high-end IC sales. High-end IC sales increased by $62.9 million to $166.9 million in 2015 as a result of increased high-end memory and logic demand, and high-end FPD sales increased by $4.5 million to $70.9 million in 2015. High-end photomasks, which typically have higher ASPs, include photomask sets for IC products using 45 nanometer and below technologies, and for FPD products using Generation 8 and above and AMOLED technologies. By geographic area, net sales in 2015 as compared with 2014 increased (decreased) by $38.1 million or 22.8% in Taiwan, by $7.5 million or 5.4% in Korea, by $26.1 million or 24.4% in the United States and by $(2.9) million or (7.6)% in Europe. As a percent of total sales in 2015, sales were 39% in Taiwan, 28% in Korea, 25% in the United States, 7% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nNet sales for 2014 increased 7.9% to $455.5 million as compared with $422.2 million for 2013. The increase of $33.3 million was primarily related to increased IC sales of $32.1 million, principally associated with the acquisition of DPTT in Taiwan, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. High-end IC sales increased $24.1 million to $104 million, principally related to increased units from Asian foundry business in Taiwan and Korea. Total IC sales increased by $32.1 million or 10.0% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the increased sales in Taiwan. Total FPD sales increased by $1.2 million or 1.2% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased sales of mature units. By geographic area, net sales in 2014 as compared with 2013 increased (decreased) by $6.1 million or 4.5% in Korea, by $(20.3) million or (16.0)% in the United States, by $49.7 million or 42.4% in Taiwan, by $(2.4) million or (5.8)% in Europe and by $0.2 million at other international locations. As a percent of total sales in 2014, sales were 31% in Korea, 23% in the United States, 37% in Taiwan, 8% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nGross Margin\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit and gross margin increased in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to increased high-end IC sales and reduced manufacturing costs. Gross margin decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased equipment costs, including depreciation expense associated with additional high-end equipment. The Company operates in a high fixed cost environment and, to the extent that the Company's revenues and utilization increase or decrease, gross margin will generally be positively or negatively impacted.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S,G&A expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.3.\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million in 2015, as compared with 2014, primarily due to expenses incurred in 2014 related to the acquisition of DPTT, offset in part by increased compensation and benefits expenses.

Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily as a result of financing expenses incurred related to the exchange of convertible notes and reduced interest income, which were offset in part by increased foreign currency gains.\nIn April 2014 DNP Photomask Technology Taiwan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of DNP, merged into PSMC and operates under the name of Photronics DNP Mask Corporation. The acquisition resulted in the Company recording a gain of $16.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nInterest expense decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily as a result of reduced outstanding borrowing balances. Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily as a result of reduced interest income, offset in part by increased foreign currency exchange gains.\nIncome Tax Provision\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily due to earnings, including the fiscal year 2014 DPTT Acquisition gain, being taxed at lower statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of various investment credits claimed in a foreign jurisdiction as well as valuation allowances in jurisdictions with historic and continuing losses.\nThe Company considers all available evidence when evaluating the potential future realization of its deferred tax assets and when, based on the weight of all available evidence, it determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, it reduces its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance. As a result of these considerations, including any changes in its deferred tax liability, the valuation allowance was increased (decreased) by ($10.8 million), ($7.1 million) and $1.1 million as of the end of the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During fiscal year 2015, the Company determined that sufficient positive evidence existed in two foreign jurisdictions that it was more likely than not that additional deferred taxes of $2.4 million were realizable and, accordingly, reduced their related valuation allowances. The Company also regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future tax examinations and, accordingly, has recorded accruals for such contingencies.\nPKLT, the Company's FPD manufacturing facility in Taiwan, has been accorded a tax holiday which commenced in 2012 and expires in 2017. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to increase its Asian presence, which was in response to fundamental changes that took place in the semiconductor industry that the Company serves. This tax holiday had no dollar or per share effect on the 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years.\nPDMC acquired an IC manufacturing facility in Taiwan as a result of the DPTT Acquisition that has been accorded a tax holiday, which commenced in 2015 and expires in 2019. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to enter into the DPTT Acquisition and increase its Asian presence. The Company realized a $0.2 million tax benefit from the PDMC tax holiday in 2015. The tax holiday had no per share effect in 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6.2 million to $12.2 million in 2015, as compared with $6.0 million in 2014, and increased $4.4 million to $6.0 million in 2014, as compared with $1.6 million in 2013, primarily as a result of changes in the ownership structure of the Company's IC manufacturing facility located in Taiwan and increased net income at that facility. During 2014, the Company exchanged a 49.99% noncontrolling interest in this subsidiary in return for the net assets of an acquiree.

The Company's working capital decreased $26.0 million to $171.4 million at November 1, 2015, as compared with $197.4 million at November 2, 2014. The increase in cash in 2015 was primarily related to increased cash generated from operating activities, while the decrease in working capital was the result of $57.5 million 3.25% convertible senior notes due in April 2016 classified as a current liability at November 1, 2015, and as a long-term liability at November 2, 2014. The Company may use its cash available on hand for operations, capital expenditures, debt repayments, strategic opportunities, stock repurchases or other corporate uses, any of which may be material.\nAs of November 2, 2014, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $192.9 million compared with $215.6 million as of November 3, 2013. The Company's working capital decreased $16.5 million to $197.4 million at November 2, 2014, as compared with $213.9 million at November 3, 2013. The decrease in cash and working capital in 2014 was primarily related to the repayment of a term loan outstanding balance of $21.3 million in December 2013.\nAs of November 1, 2015 and November 2, 2014, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents include $102.9 million and $105.9 million, respectively, held by its foreign subsidiaries. The majority of earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The repatriation of these funds to the U.S. may subject these funds to U.S. federal income taxes and local country withholding tax in certain jurisdictions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries continue to grow through the reinvestment of earnings in additional manufacturing capacity and capability, particularly in the high-end IC and FPD areas.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to $133.2 million in fiscal 2015, as compared with $96.4 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased net income in 2015, excluding the 2014 noncash gain on the acquisition of DPTT. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $96.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared with $99.4 million in fiscal 2013, primarily due to reduced net income in 2014, less a noncash gain on the acquisition of DPTT discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $99.4 million in fiscal 2013, as compared with $132.5 million in fiscal 2012, primarily due to reduced year-over-year net income and depreciation and amortization, and less cash generated from accounts receivable in 2013 than in 2012.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 increased to $104.3 million, as compared with $87.5 million in 2014, and in fiscal 2014 increased to $87.5 million, as compared with $66.2 million in 2013, primarily due to increased capital expenditure payments. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 decreased to $66.2 million, as compared with $111.9 million in 2012, primarily due to less capital expenditure payments in 2013, and also due to no additional investments being made in the MP Mask joint venture in 2013, whereas $13.4 million was invested in 2012. Capital expenditure payments for the 2015, 2014, and 2013 fiscal years were $104.0 million, $91.1 million and $63.8 million, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditure payments for fiscal 2016 to range between $50 million and $75 million, primarily related to investment in high-end IC manufacturing capability.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million in fiscal 2015, which was primarily comprised of repayments of borrowings offset, in part, by proceeds from share-based arrangements. Net cash used in financing activities was $29.5 million in fiscal 2014, primarily comprised of repayments of borrowings, and was $39.8 million in fiscal 2013 primarily comprised of payments to purchase common stock of a subsidiary and repayments of borrowings. In fiscal 2014 the Company repaid a term loan with an outstanding balance of $21.3 million.\nIn March 2015 the Company announced that the MP Mask joint venture would not be renewed after May 5, 2016. The MP Mask operating agreement provides that Micron will make a payment to the Company to purchase the Company's equity interest in MP Mask based on the Company's ownership percentage of the net book value of MP Mask at that time, which, as of September 3, 2015, was approximately $93 million. The Company does not expect that it will incur a significant gain or loss on this transaction. Concurrently, the Company announced that it entered into supply and technology license agreements with Micron. This supply agreement, which commences on May 6, 2016, with a one-year term subject to mutually agreeable renewals, provides that the Company will be the majority outsource supplier of Micron's photomasks and related services. The technology license agreement commenced in March 2015 and continues through the earlier of one year from the termination of the initial technology license agreement, which will occur on May 5, 2016, or when Micron certifies that it has transferred certain defined technology to the Company. The Company forevermore has the rights to use the technology obtained under these technology license agreements.\nIn January 2015 the Company privately exchanged $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% convertible senior notes with a maturity date of April 1, 2016, for new 3.25% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million with a maturity date of April 1, 2019. The conversion rate of the new notes is the same as that of the exchanged notes, which were issued in March 2011 with a conversion rate of approximately 96 shares of common stock per $1,000 note principal, equivalent to a conversion price of $10.37 per share of common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which are described in the indenture dated January 22, 2015. Note holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2019, and the Company is not required to redeem the notes prior to their maturity date. Interest on the notes accrues in arrears, and is paid semiannually through the notes' maturity date.\nIn October 2014, in a non-cash transaction, the Company issued 4.3 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the fully matured, remaining outstanding $22.1 million principal amount 5.5% convertible senior notes, which were issued in September 2009.\nIn April 2014 the Company acquired DPTT in a non-cash transaction that resulted in the Company owning 50.01% and DNP owning 49.99% of PDMC, whose financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. PDMC has generated sufficient cash flows to fund its operating and capital requirements. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn August 2014 the Company amended its credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2018, has a $50 million limit with an expansion capacity to $75 million, and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets located in the United States and common stock the Company owns in certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The credit facility is subject to minimum interest coverage, total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balance financial covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at November 1, 2015. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit facility at November 1, 2015, and $50 million was available for borrowing. The interest rate on the credit facility (1.44% at November 1, 2015) is based on the Company's total leverage ratio at LIBOR plus a spread, as defined in the credit facility.\nIn December 2013 the Company repaid the $21.3 million outstanding balance of a term loan that it entered into in February 2012 to partially fund its purchase from Micron of the US nanoFab facility in Boise, Idaho, which it previously held under an operating lease. As a result of this purchase, the Company's operating lease commitments were reduced by a combined total of $15 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.\nIn June 2013 the Company completed a tender offer for shares of PSMC, a former subsidiary of the Company. A total of 50.3 million shares were tendered at the offering price of 16.30 NTD, equivalent to a total of $27.4 million. In September 2013 the Company purchased an additional 1.1 million shares of PSMC for $0.7 million, and in January 2014 the Company acquired all of the 3.0 million shares that were then held by noncontrolling interests at a cost of $1.7 million. In April 2014 PSMC merged with DPTT to form PDMC.\nPSMC, through a series of repurchase programs which commenced in 2011 and ended in 2013, repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock. These repurchase programs resulted in 9.2 million shares being purchased for $4.2 million in 2013, 35.9 million shares being purchased for $15.6 million in 2012 and 21.6 million shares being purchased for $9.9 million in 2011.\nIn August 2013 a $26.4 million principal amount, five year capital lease commenced to fund the purchase of a high-end lithography tool. Payments under the lease, which bears interest at 2.77% are $0.5 million per month through July 2018. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company must maintain the equipment in good working order, and is subject to a cross default with a cross acceleration provision related to certain nonfinancial covenants incorporated in its credit facility. As of November 1, 2015, the total amount payable through the end of the lease term was $16.0 million, of which $15.3 million represents principal and $0.7 million represents interest.\nThe Company's liquidity is highly dependent on its sales volume, cash conversion cycle, and the timing of its capital expenditures (which can vary significantly from period to period), as it operates in a high fixed cost environment. Depending on conditions in the semiconductor and FPD markets, the Company's cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet its current and long-term needs for capital expenditures, operations and debt repayments. Historically, in certain years, the Company has used external financing to fund these needs. Due to conditions in the credit markets and covenant restrictions on its existing debt, some financing instruments used by the Company in the past may not be currently available to it. The Company continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives. However, the Company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to it on commercially favorable terms, should its cash requirements exceed cash available from operations, existing cash, and cash available under its credit facility.\nAt November 1, 2015, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of $14 million, which included $3 million related to capital expenditures, primarily for investment in high-end IC photomask manufacturing capability. The Company intends to finance its capital expenditures with its working capital, cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, with additional borrowings.\nCash Requirements\nThe Company's cash requirements in fiscal 2016 will be primarily to fund its operations, including capital spending, and to service its debt. The Company believes that its cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months. The Company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets. However, the Company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the Company on commercially favorable terms, should the Company's cash requirements exceed its cash available from operations, existing cash, and cash available under its credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the Company's contractual obligations as of November 1, 2015:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payment due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 -

Cumulatively, through November 1, 2015, the Company has contributed $32.5 million to the joint venture, and has received distributions from the joint venture totaling $10.0 million. The Company did not make any contributions and received no distributions from MP Mask during fiscal 2015. On March 24, 2015, the Company announced that the MP Mask joint venture would not be renewed after May 5, 2016. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nUnder the PDMC joint venture operating agreement the shareholders of PDMC may be requested to make additional contributions to PDMC. In the event that PDMC requests additional capital from its shareholders, the Company may be required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture in order to maintain its 50.01% ownership. The PDMC operating agreement limits the amount of contributions that may be requested during both PDMC's first four years and during any individual year within those first four years. As of November 1, 2015, the Company had not been requested to and did not make any additional capital contributions to PDMC.\nThe Company leases certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases that may require it to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses related to the properties. Certain of these leases contain renewal or purchase options exercisable at the end of the lease terms. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these operating leases.\nBusiness Outlook\nA majority of the Company's revenue growth is expected to continue to come from the Asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of North America and Europe. Additional revenue growth is also anticipated in North America, as the Company expects to continue to benefit from advanced technology it may utilize under its technology license with Micron.\nThe Company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy and monitor its sales volume and related cash flows from operations. This ongoing assessment could result in future facility closures, asset redeployments, additional impairments of intangible or long-lived assets, workforce reductions, or the addition of increased manufacturing facilities, all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements.\nThe Company's future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties. While various risks and uncertainties have been discussed, a number of other unforeseen factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the Company's accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company's estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they are made. Changes in accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Actual results reported by the Company may differ from such estimates. The Company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period in which they are determined.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Company's 3.25% convertible senior notes is estimated by management based upon reference to quoted market prices and other available market information. The fair values of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, certain other current assets and current liabilities, and variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, except as explained below under \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,\" are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Repairs and maintenance, as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature, are charged to operations as incurred, while those that improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition, the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 15 to 40 years, machinery and equipment over 3 to 10 years, and furniture, fixtures and office equipment over 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods. The Company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property, plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn, plant closures, technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of a technology license agreement, a supply agreement and acquisition-related intangibles. These assets, except as explained below, are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 15 years, using the straight-line method or another method that more fairly represents the utilization of the assets.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. In the event that the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life has changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. If it is determined that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life, that intangible asset would be subject to impairment testing annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not, based on future undiscounted cash flows or market factors, be recoverable, and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined. The measurement of the impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the intangible asset.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the Company's judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets. The carrying values of assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values. Fair values of the impaired assets would generally be determined using a market or income approach.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen acquiring other businesses or participating in mergers or joint ventures in which the Company is deemed to be the acquirer, the Company generally recognizes identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests at their acquisition date fair values, and separately from any goodwill that may be required to be recognized. Goodwill, when recognizable, would be measured as the excess amount of any consideration transferred, which is generally measured at fair value, over the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nAccounting for such transactions requires the Company's management to make significant assumptions and estimates. These include, among others, any estimates or assumptions that may be made for the amounts of future cash flows that will result from any identified intangible assets, the useful lives of such intangible assets, the amount of any contingent liabilities to record at the time of the acquisition, the extent of any restructuring charges expected to be incurred as a result of the business combination, and the fair values of any tangible assets acquired. Although the Company believes any estimates and assumptions it makes to be reasonable and appropriate at the time they are made, unanticipated events and circumstances may arise that affect their accuracy, causing actual results to differ from those estimated by the Company.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nThe financial results of investments in joint ventures of which the Company has a controlling financial interest are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In the case of any investment in a joint venture that gave rise to goodwill, such goodwill would be tested for impairment annually or when an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not have reduced the fair value of the joint venture below its carry value. Goodwill would be tested for impairment using a two-step process. The Company might, at its option, assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If it was determined that the two-step test was necessary, the Company would use the test to identify potential goodwill impairment and to measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any).\nInvestments in joint ventures over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general, are at least 20 percent owned are accounted for under the equity method. An impairment loss would be recognized whenever a decrease in the value of such an investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary. In judging \"other than temporary,\" the Company would consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the investee, and the Company's longer-term intent of retaining its investment in the investee.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company accounts for the investments it makes in certain legal entities in which equity investors do not have 1) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, 2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have either the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or, 3) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. These certain legal entities are referred to as variable interest entities\u201d, or VIEs\u201d.\nThe Company would consolidate the results of any such entity in which it determined that it has a controlling financial interest. The Company would have a controlling financial interest\u201d in such an entity if the Company had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of, or right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Company reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in any investments it has in these certain legal entities.\nThe Company accounts for investments it makes in VIEs in which it has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over and holds at least a 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method. Any such investment not meeting the parameters to be accounted under the equity method would be accounted for using the cost method, unless the investment had a readily determinable fair value, at which it would then be reported.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision is computed on the basis of the various tax jurisdictions' income or loss before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required, if their realization is not more likely than not, by considering future market growth, forecasted operations, future taxable income, and the amounts of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.\nThe Company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate. Current income tax exposure is identified and temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes are assessed. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company evaluates the potential realization of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if their realization is deemed not more likely than not. Accordingly, income taxes charged against earnings may have been impacted by changes in the valuation allowances. Significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recording a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in its tax returns. The Company includes any applicable interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its income tax provision.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is determined by the shipping terms of the individual sales transactions. For sales with FOB destination or similar shipping terms, delivery occurs when the Company's product reaches its destination and is received by the customer. For sales with FOB shipping point terms, delivery occurs when the Company's product is received by the common carrier. The Company uses judgment when estimating the effect on revenue of discounts and sales incentives, both of which are accrued when the related revenue is recognized.\nWarranties and Other Post Shipment Obligations - For a 30-day period, the Company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specifications. However, the Company's liability is limited to the repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option. The Company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment. Accordingly, customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant. The Company's specific return policies include accepting returns of products with defects, or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Determining the appropriate option pricing model, calculating the grant date fair value of share-based awards and estimating forfeiture rates requires considerable judgment, including the estimations of stock price volatility and the expected term of options granted.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value employee stock options. The Company estimates stock price volatility based on daily averages of its historical volatility over a term approximately equal to the estimated time period the grant will remain outstanding. The expected term of options and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 8.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended November 1, 2015, November 2, 2014 and November 3, 2013\nOverview\nThe Company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers, and manufacturers of FPDs. Photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics, micro-electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications. The Company's selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications, particularly as they relate to the semiconductor industry's migration to more advanced product innovation, design methodologies and fabrication processes. The Company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products manufactured using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. However, the reduced use of customized ICs, reductions in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and FPDs increases. Advances in semiconductor, FPD and photomask design and semiconductor and FPD production methods that shift the burden of achieving device performance away from lithography could also reduce the demand for photomasks. Historically, the microelectronic industry has been volatile, experiencing periodic downturns and slowdowns in design activity. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices.\nThe Company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time, sometimes within 24 hours. This results in the Company having a minimal level of backlog orders, typically one to two weeks for IC photomasks and two to three weeks for FPD photomasks.\nThe global semiconductor industry, including mobile display devices, is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including, but not limited to, mobile communications and computing solutions.\nThe Company cannot predict the timing of the industry's transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy, but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future, beneficially and adversely affecting its business, financial condition and operating results as they occur. The Company believes its ability to remain successful in these environments is dependent upon its achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader and efficient solutions supplier, which it believes should enable it to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure.\nThe Company is focused on improving its competitiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs and, in connection therewith, has invested and plans to continue to invest in manufacturing equipment to serve the high-end market. As the Company continues to face challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness, it continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives.\nAs of December 2015 state-of-the-art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be 45 nanometer and lower for ICs and Generation 8 and above and AMOLED display based process technologies for FPDs. However, 65 nanometer and above geometries for semiconductors and Generation 7 and below, excluding AMOLED, process technologies for FPDs constitute the majority of designs currently being fabricated in volume. At these geometries, the Company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the Company's competitors that is not available to the Company. The Company expects 45 nanometer and below designs to continue to move to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal 2016, and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business as a result of its investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located.\nThe photomask industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. In order to remain competitive, the Company will be required to continually anticipate, respond to, and utilize changing technologies. In particular, the Company believes that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller, it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically-enhanced reticles, including optical proximity correction and phase-shift photomasks. Additionally, demand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks used, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field-programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs or the use of certain chip stacking methodologies that lessen the emphasis on conventional lithography technology. Furthermore, increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors. As of the end of fiscal 2015, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production, and the Company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of this or other alternative semiconductor design methodologies. However, should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring IC designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance, and the Company does not anticipate, respond to, or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource, technological or other constraints, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBoth revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high-end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities, but generally command higher average selling prices (\"ASPs\"). The Company's capital expenditure payments aggregated approximately $259 million for the three fiscal years ended November 1, 2015, which has significantly contributed to the Company's operating expenses. The Company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth, and expects capital expenditure payments to be between $50 million and $75 million in fiscal 2016.\nThe manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ICs and other related products built using comparable photomask-based process technologies has been, and continues to be, capital intensive. The Company's integrated global manufacturing network, which consists of nine manufacturing sites, and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base. Should sales volumes decrease as a result of a decrease in design releases from the Company's customers, the Company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins, or result in write-offs from asset impairments.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company announced that the MP Mask joint venture would not be renewed after May 5, 2016. The MP Mask operating agreement provides that Micron will make a payment to the Company to purchase the Company's equity interest in MP Mask based on the Company's ownership percentage of the net book value of MP Mask at that time, which, as of September 3, 2015, was approximately $93 million. The Company does not expect that it will incur a significant gain or loss on this transaction. Concurrently, the Company announced that it entered into supply and technology license agreements with Micron. This supply agreement, which commences on May 6, 2016, with a one-year term subject to mutually agreeable renewals, provides that the Company will be the majority outsource supplier of Micron's photomasks and related services. The technology license agreement commenced in March 2015 and continues through the earlier of one year from the termination of the initial technology license agreement, which will occur on May 5, 2016, or when Micron certifies that it has transferred certain defined technology to the Company. The Company forevermore has the rights to use the technology obtained under these technology license agreements.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company privately exchanged $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% convertible senior notes with a maturity date of April 1, 2016, for new 3.25% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million with a maturity date of April 1, 2019. The conversion rate of the new notes is the same as that of the exchanged notes, which were issued in March 2011 with a conversion rate of approximately 96 shares of common stock per $1,000 note principal, equivalent to a conversion price of $10.37 per share of common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which are described in the indenture dated January 22, 2015. Note holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2019, and the Company is not required to redeem the notes prior to their maturity date. Interest on the notes accrues in arrears, and is paid semiannually through the notes' maturity date.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired DPTT in a non-cash transaction that resulted in the Company owning 50.01% and DNP owning 49.99% of PDMC, whose financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. PDMC has generated sufficient cash flows to fund its operating and capital requirements. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company amended its credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2018, has a $50 million limit with an expansion capacity to $75 million, and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets located in the United States and common stock the Company owns in certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The credit facility is subject to a minimum interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balance financial covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at November 1, 2015. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit facility at November 1, 2015, and $50 million was available for borrowing. The interest rate on the credit facility (1.44% at November 1, 2015) is based on the Company's total leverage ratio at LIBOR plus a spread, as defined in the credit facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 a $26.4 million principal amount, five year capital lease commenced to fund the purchase of a high-end lithography tool. Payments under the lease, which bears interest at 2.77% are $0.5 million per month through July 2018. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company must maintain the equipment in good working order, and is subject to a cross default with a cross acceleration provision related to certain nonfinancial covenants incorporated in its credit facility. As of November 1, 2015, the total amount payable through the end of the lease term was $16.0 million, of which $15.3 million represents principal and $0.7 million represents interest.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company completed a tender offer for shares of PSMC. A total of 50.3 million shares were tendered at the offering price of 16.30 NTD (equivalent to a total of $27.4 million), which increased the Company's ownership interest in PSMC from 75.11% to 98.13%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company further increased its ownership interest in PSMC to 98.63% with the purchase of an additional 1.1 million shares of PSMC for $0.7 million, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired all of the 3.0 million shares that were then held by noncontrolling interests at a cost of $1.7 million. In April 2014 PSMC merged with DPTT to form PDMC.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2013 PSMC completed a stock repurchase plan that had been authorized by its board of directors in fiscal 2012. The completion of this repurchase plan resulted in the Company acquiring an additional 9.2 million shares at a cost $4.2 million, and increasing its ownership percentage in PSMC from 72.09% at October 28, 2012 to 75.11% as of January 27, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales:\n\nNote: All the following tabular comparisons, unless otherwise indicated, are for the fiscal years ended November 1, 2015 (2015), November 2, 2014 (2014) and November 3, 2013 (2013), in millions of dollars.\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales for 2015 increased 15.1% as compared with 2014. The increase was primarily a result of a full year impact of the acquisition of DPTT and increased high-end IC sales. High-end IC sales increased by $62.9 million to $166.9 million in 2015 as a result of increased high-end memory and logic demand, and high-end FPD sales increased by $4.5 million to $70.9 million in 2015. High-end photomasks, which typically have higher ASPs, include photomask sets for IC products using 45 nanometer and below technologies, and for FPD products using Generation 8 and above and AMOLED technologies. By geographic area, net sales in 2015 as compared with 2014 increased (decreased) by $38.1 million or 22.8% in Taiwan, by $7.5 million or 5.4% in Korea, by $26.1 million or 24.4% in the United States and by $(2.9) million or (7.6)% in Europe. As a percent of total sales in 2015, sales were 39% in Taiwan, 28% in Korea, 25% in the United States, 7% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nNet sales for 2014 increased 7.9% to $455.5 million as compared with $422.2 million for 2013. The increase of $33.3 million was primarily related to increased IC sales of $32.1 million, principally associated with the acquisition of DPTT in Taiwan, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. High-end IC sales increased $24.1 million to $104 million, principally related to increased units from Asian foundry business in Taiwan and Korea. Total IC sales increased by $32.1 million or 10.0% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the increased sales in Taiwan. Total FPD sales increased by $1.2 million or 1.2% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased sales of mature units. By geographic area, net sales in 2014 as compared with 2013 increased (decreased) by $6.1 million or 4.5% in Korea, by $(20.3) million or (16.0)% in the United States, by $49.7 million or 42.4% in Taiwan, by $(2.4) million or (5.8)% in Europe and by $0.2 million at other international locations. As a percent of total sales in 2014, sales were 31% in Korea, 23% in the United States, 37% in Taiwan, 8% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nGross Margin\n\nGross profit and gross margin increased in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to increased high-end IC sales and reduced manufacturing costs. Gross margin decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased equipment costs, including depreciation expense associated with additional high-end equipment. The Company operates in a high fixed cost environment and, to the extent that the Company's revenues and utilization increase or decrease, gross margin will generally be positively or negatively impacted.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million in 2015, as compared with 2014, primarily due to expenses incurred in 2014 related to the acquisition of DPTT, offset in part by increased compensation and benefits expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million in 2014, as compared with 2013, primarily as a result of increased expenses related to the acquisition of DPTT.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of global development efforts related to high-end process technologies. Research and development expenses were $21.9 million in 2015 and 2014, and increased $1.1 million in 2014 from $20.8 million in 2013, primarily due to increased activities at advanced technology nodes for IC photomask applications.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nInterest expense decreased in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily as a result of reduced average outstanding borrowings during the year. Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily as a result of financing expenses incurred related to the exchange of convertible notes and reduced interest income, which were offset in part by increased foreign currency gains.\nIn April 2014 DNP Photomask Technology Taiwan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of DNP, merged into PSMC and operates under the name of Photronics DNP Mask Corporation. The acquisition resulted in the Company recording a gain of $16.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nInterest expense decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily as a result of reduced outstanding borrowing balances. Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily as a result of reduced interest income, offset in part by increased foreign currency exchange gains.\nIncome Tax Provision\n\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily due to earnings, including the fiscal year 2014 DPTT Acquisition gain, being taxed at lower statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of various investment credits claimed in a foreign jurisdiction as well as valuation allowances in jurisdictions with historic and continuing losses.\nThe Company considers all available evidence when evaluating the potential future realization of its deferred tax assets and when, based on the weight of all available evidence, it determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, it reduces its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance. As a result of these considerations, including any changes in its deferred tax liability, the valuation allowance was increased (decreased) by ($10.8 million), ($7.1 million) and $1.1 million as of the end of the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During fiscal year 2015, the Company determined that sufficient positive evidence existed in two foreign jurisdictions that it was more likely than not that additional deferred taxes of $2.4 million were realizable and, accordingly, reduced their related valuation allowances. The Company also regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future tax examinations and, accordingly, has recorded accruals for such contingencies.\nPKLT, the Company's FPD manufacturing facility in Taiwan, has been accorded a tax holiday which commenced in 2012 and expires in 2017. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to increase its Asian presence, which was in response to fundamental changes that took place in the semiconductor industry that the Company serves. This tax holiday had no dollar or per share effect on the 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years.\nPDMC acquired an IC manufacturing facility in Taiwan as a result of the DPTT Acquisition that has been accorded a tax holiday, which commenced in 2015 and expires in 2019. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to enter into the DPTT Acquisition and increase its Asian presence. The Company realized a $0.2 million tax benefit from the PDMC tax holiday in 2015. The tax holiday had no per share effect in 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6.2 million to $12.2 million in 2015, as compared with $6.0 million in 2014, and increased $4.4 million to $6.0 million in 2014, as compared with $1.6 million in 2013, primarily as a result of changes in the ownership structure of the Company's IC manufacturing facility located in Taiwan and increased net income at that facility. During 2014, the Company exchanged a 49.99% noncontrolling interest in this subsidiary in return for the net assets of an acquiree. See Notes 2 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended November 1, 2015, November 2, 2014 and November 3, 2013\nOverview\nThe Company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers, and manufacturers of FPDs. Photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics, micro-electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications. The Company's selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications, particularly as they relate to the semiconductor industry's migration to more advanced product innovation, design methodologies and fabrication processes. The Company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products manufactured using photomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. However, the reduced use of customized ICs, reductions in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and FPDs increases. Advances in semiconductor, FPD and photomask design and semiconductor and FPD production methods that shift the burden of achieving device performance away from lithography could also reduce the demand for photomasks. Historically, the microelectronic industry has been volatile, experiencing periodic downturns and slowdowns in design activity. These downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices.\nThe Company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time, sometimes within 24 hours. This results in the Company having a minimal level of backlog orders, typically one to two weeks for IC photomasks and two to three weeks for FPD photomasks.\nThe global semiconductor industry, including mobile display devices, is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including, but not limited to, mobile communications and computing solutions.\nThe Company cannot predict the timing of the industry's transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy, but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future, beneficially and adversely affecting its business, financial condition and operating results as they occur. The Company believes its ability to remain successful in these environments is dependent upon its achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader and efficient solutions supplier, which it believes should enable it to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure.\nThe Company is focused on improving its competitiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs and, in connection therewith, has invested and plans to continue to invest in manufacturing equipment to serve the high-end market. As the Company continues to face challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness, it continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives.\nAs of December 2015 state-of-the-art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be 45 nanometer and lower for ICs and Generation 8 and above and AMOLED display based process technologies for FPDs. However, 65 nanometer and above geometries for semiconductors and Generation 7 and below, excluding AMOLED, process technologies for FPDs constitute the majority of designs currently being fabricated in volume. At these geometries, the Company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the Company's competitors that is not available to the Company. The Company expects 45 nanometer and below designs to continue to move to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal 2016, and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business as a result of its investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located.\nThe photomask industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. In order to remain competitive, the Company will be required to continually anticipate, respond to, and utilize changing technologies. In particular, the Company believes that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller, it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically-enhanced reticles, including optical proximity correction and phase-shift photomasks. Additionally, demand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks used, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field-programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs or the use of certain chip stacking methodologies that lessen the emphasis on conventional lithography technology. Furthermore, increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors. As of the end of fiscal 2015, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production, and the Company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of this or other alternative semiconductor design methodologies. However, should direct-write or any other alternative method of transferring IC designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance, and the Company does not anticipate, respond to, or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource, technological or other constraints, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBoth revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high-end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities, but generally command higher average selling prices (\"ASPs\"). The Company's capital expenditure payments aggregated approximately $259 million for the three fiscal years ended November 1, 2015, which has significantly contributed to the Company's operating expenses. The Company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth, and expects capital expenditure payments to be between $50 million and $75 million in fiscal 2016.\nThe manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ICs and other related products built using comparable photomask-based process technologies has been, and continues to be, capital intensive. The Company's integrated global manufacturing network, which consists of nine manufacturing sites, and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base. Should sales volumes decrease as a result of a decrease in design releases from the Company's customers, the Company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins, or result in write-offs from asset impairments.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company announced that the MP Mask joint venture would not be renewed after May 5, 2016. The MP Mask operating agreement provides that Micron will make a payment to the Company to purchase the Company's equity interest in MP Mask based on the Company's ownership percentage of the net book value of MP Mask at that time, which, as of September 3, 2015, was approximately $93 million. The Company does not expect that it will incur a significant gain or loss on this transaction. Concurrently, the Company announced that it entered into supply and technology license agreements with Micron. This supply agreement, which commences on May 6, 2016, with a one-year term subject to mutually agreeable renewals, provides that the Company will be the majority outsource supplier of Micron's photomasks and related services. The technology license agreement commenced in March 2015 and continues through the earlier of one year from the termination of the initial technology license agreement, which will occur on May 5, 2016, or when Micron certifies that it has transferred certain defined technology to the Company. The Company forevermore has the rights to use the technology obtained under these technology license agreements.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company privately exchanged $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% convertible senior notes with a maturity date of April 1, 2016, for new 3.25% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $57.5 million with a maturity date of April 1, 2019. The conversion rate of the new notes is the same as that of the exchanged notes, which were issued in March 2011 with a conversion rate of approximately 96 shares of common stock per $1,000 note principal, equivalent to a conversion price of $10.37 per share of common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which are described in the indenture dated January 22, 2015. Note holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2019, and the Company is not required to redeem the notes prior to their maturity date. Interest on the notes accrues in arrears, and is paid semiannually through the notes' maturity date.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired DPTT in a non-cash transaction that resulted in the Company owning 50.01% and DNP owning 49.99% of PDMC, whose financial results are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. PDMC has generated sufficient cash flows to fund its operating and capital requirements. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company amended its credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2018, has a $50 million limit with an expansion capacity to $75 million, and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets located in the United States and common stock the Company owns in certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The credit facility is subject to a minimum interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balance financial covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at November 1, 2015. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit facility at November 1, 2015, and $50 million was available for borrowing. The interest rate on the credit facility (1.44% at November 1, 2015) is based on the Company's total leverage ratio at LIBOR plus a spread, as defined in the credit facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 a $26.4 million principal amount, five year capital lease commenced to fund the purchase of a high-end lithography tool. Payments under the lease, which bears interest at 2.77% are $0.5 million per month through July 2018. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company must maintain the equipment in good working order, and is subject to a cross default with a cross acceleration provision related to certain nonfinancial covenants incorporated in its credit facility. As of November 1, 2015, the total amount payable through the end of the lease term was $16.0 million, of which $15.3 million represents principal and $0.7 million represents interest.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company completed a tender offer for shares of PSMC. A total of 50.3 million shares were tendered at the offering price of 16.30 NTD (equivalent to a total of $27.4 million), which increased the Company's ownership interest in PSMC from 75.11% to 98.13%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company further increased its ownership interest in PSMC to 98.63% with the purchase of an additional 1.1 million shares of PSMC for $0.7 million, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the Company acquired all of the 3.0 million shares that were then held by noncontrolling interests at a cost of $1.7 million. In April 2014 PSMC merged with DPTT to form PDMC.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2013 PSMC completed a stock repurchase plan that had been authorized by its board of directors in fiscal 2012. The completion of this repurchase plan resulted in the Company acquiring an additional 9.2 million shares at a cost $4.2 million, and increasing its ownership percentage in PSMC from 72.09% at October 28, 2012 to 75.11% as of January 27, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for 2015 increased 15.1% as compared with 2014. The increase was primarily a result of a full year impact of the acquisition of DPTT and increased high-end IC sales. High-end IC sales increased by $62.9 million to $166.9 million in 2015 as a result of increased high-end memory and logic demand, and high-end FPD sales increased by $4.5 million to $70.9 million in 2015. High-end photomasks, which typically have higher ASPs, include photomask sets for IC products using 45 nanometer and below technologies, and for FPD products using Generation 8 and above and AMOLED technologies. By geographic area, net sales in 2015 as compared with 2014 increased (decreased) by $38.1 million or 22.8% in Taiwan, by $7.5 million or 5.4% in Korea, by $26.1 million or 24.4% in the United States and by $(2.9) million or (7.6)% in Europe. As a percent of total sales in 2015, sales were 39% in Taiwan, 28% in Korea, 25% in the United States, 7% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nNet sales for 2014 increased 7.9% to $455.5 million as compared with $422.2 million for 2013. The increase of $33.3 million was primarily related to increased IC sales of $32.1 million, principally associated with the acquisition of DPTT in Taiwan, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. High-end IC sales increased $24.1 million to $104 million, principally related to increased units from Asian foundry business in Taiwan and Korea. Total IC sales increased by $32.1 million or 10.0% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the increased sales in Taiwan. Total FPD sales increased by $1.2 million or 1.2% in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased sales of mature units. By geographic area, net sales in 2014 as compared with 2013 increased (decreased) by $6.1 million or 4.5% in Korea, by $(20.3) million or (16.0)% in the United States, by $49.7 million or 42.4% in Taiwan, by $(2.4) million or (5.8)% in Europe and by $0.2 million at other international locations. As a percent of total sales in 2014, sales were 31% in Korea, 23% in the United States, 37% in Taiwan, 8% in Europe, and 1% at other international locations.\nGross Margin\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit and gross margin increased in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to increased high-end IC sales and reduced manufacturing costs.

As a result of these considerations, including any changes in its deferred tax liability, the valuation allowance was increased (decreased) by ($10.8 million), ($7.1 million) and $1.1 million as of the end of the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During fiscal year 2015, the Company determined that sufficient positive evidence existed in two foreign jurisdictions that it was more likely than not that additional deferred taxes of $2.4 million were realizable and, accordingly, reduced their related valuation allowances. The Company also regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future tax examinations and, accordingly, has recorded accruals for such contingencies.\nPKLT, the Company's FPD manufacturing facility in Taiwan, has been accorded a tax holiday which commenced in 2012 and expires in 2017. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to increase its Asian presence, which was in response to fundamental changes that took place in the semiconductor industry that the Company serves. This tax holiday had no dollar or per share effect on the 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years.\nPDMC acquired an IC manufacturing facility in Taiwan as a result of the DPTT Acquisition that has been accorded a tax holiday, which commenced in 2015 and expires in 2019. The availability of this tax holiday did not have a significant impact on the Company's decision to enter into the DPTT Acquisition and increase its Asian presence. The Company realized a $0.2 million tax benefit from the PDMC tax holiday in 2015. The tax holiday had no per share effect in 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $6.2 million to $12.2 million in 2015, as compared with $6.0 million in 2014, and increased $4.4 million to $6.0 million in 2014, as compared with $1.6 million in 2013, primarily as a result of changes in the ownership structure of the Company's IC manufacturing facility located in Taiwan and increased net income at that facility. During 2014, the Company exchanged a 49.99% noncontrolling interest in this subsidiary in return for the net assets of an acquiree.
