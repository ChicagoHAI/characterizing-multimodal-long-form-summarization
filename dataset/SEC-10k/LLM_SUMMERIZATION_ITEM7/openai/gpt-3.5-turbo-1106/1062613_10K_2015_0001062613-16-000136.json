MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business, actions of regulatory authorities and competitors and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Executive Summary\n\u2022Labor Matters\n\u2022Regulatory and Legislative\n\u2022Basis of Presentation\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Summary of Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022New Accounting Standards\n\u2022Inflation\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of advanced communications services to business, wholesale and residential customers within our service territories. We offer our customers a suite of advanced services including Ethernet, SIP-Trunking, hosted PBX, managed services, data center colocation services, high capacity data transport and other IP-based services over our fiber-based network, in addition to Internet access, HSD and local and long distance voice services. Our service territory spans 17 states where we are the incumbent communications provider primarily serving rural communities and small urban markets. Many of our LECs have served their respective communities for more than 80 years. As of December 31, 2015, we operated with approximately 311,000 broadband subscribers, approximately 14,500 Ethernet circuits and approximately 410,000 residential voice lines.\nWe own and operate an extensive fiber-based Ethernet network with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable, including approximately 17,000 miles of fiber optic cable in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, giving us capacity to support more HSD services and extend our fiber reach into more communities across the region. The IP/MPLS network architecture of our fiber-based network allows us to provide Ethernet, transport and other IP-based services with the highest level of reliability at a lower cost of service. This fiber-based Ethernet network also supplies critical infrastructure for wireless carriers serving the region as their bandwidth needs increase, driven by mobile data from smartphones, tablets and other wireless devices. As of December 31, 2015, we provide cellular transport, also known as backhaul, through over 1,900 mobile Ethernet backhaul connections. We have fiber connectivity to approximately 1,300 cellular communications towers in our service footprint.\nExecutive Summary\nOur mission is to empower businesses, consumers and communities with advanced data, IT and voice services by leveraging our network, technology and operational expertise to exceed their expectations. Our vision includes operating and technology platforms that will meet our customers' technology needs by providing them with reliable and secure connections and ready access to what matters most to them.\nOur executive management team is focused on utilizing our network assets, our outstanding operating platform and our proven ability to develop and deploy market-driven products to build brand awareness, aid in generating new revenue and sustain existing revenue. We will enhance our network to bring new services and more robust technologies to our markets, enable effective and secure technology to ensure our product and service offerings remain competitive, and provide excellent customer service to create a loyal customer base, all while maintaining a sharp focus on managing costs.\nOur objective is to transform our revenue by continuing to add advanced data products and services such as Ethernet, high capacity data transport and other IP-based services over our fiber-based network in addition to HSD services, to minimize our dependence on voice access lines. Communications companies, including us, continue to experience a decline in access lines due to increased competition from wireless carriers, cable television operators and CLECs and increased availability of alternative communications services, including wireless and voice over IP (\"VoIP\"). We will continue our efforts to retain customers to mitigate the loss of voice access lines through bundled packages, including video and other value added services. We believe access lines as a measure of the business are increasingly less meaningful measures of trend and are being replaced by revenue generating broadband subscribers and Ethernet circuits.\nOver the past few years, we have made significant capital investments in our fiber-based Ethernet network to expand our business service offerings to meet the growing data needs of our customers and to increase broadband speeds and capacity in our consumer markets. We have also focused our sales and marketing efforts on these advanced data solutions. Specifically, within the last few years, we built and launched high capacity Ethernet services to allow us to meet the capacity needs of our business customers as well as supply high capacity infrastructure to our wholesale customers. In the past year, Ethernet demand has remained strong amid increased price pressure. We continue to see a market trend, largely led by cable companies, of reduced Ethernet prices to business and wholesale customers. We continue to see growth in Ethernet units and speeds amid declining prices in the market. These advanced data services are our flagship product and are laying the foundation not only for new business but also for additional IP-based voice services in the future.\nWe believe that our extensive fiber network, with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable, including approximately 17,000 miles of fiber optic cable in northern New England and 1,300 cellular communications towers currently served with fiber, puts us in an excellent position to serve the cellular backhaul needs in our markets. We further believe the bandwidth needs of cellular backhaul will grow with the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive technology. As a result, we expect to see wireless carriers developing new technologies as demand increases on existing fiber-connected towers, including the use of \"small cell\" architecture. By satisfying additional demand for bandwidth, both traditionally and through new and evolving technology, we expect to partially offset the decline we have seen, and expect to continue to see, in legacy wholesale offerings, including TDM transport services, DS1s, DS3s and wholesale switched access.\nCoupled with recent regulatory reform in the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont that will serve to promote fair competition among communications service providers in the region, we believe that there is a significant organic growth opportunity within the business and wholesale markets given our extensive fiber network and IP-based product suite, combined with our relative low market share in these areas.\nLabor Matters\nTwo of our collective bargaining agreements that covered approximately 1,700 employees in the aggregate in northern New England were ratified on February 22, 2015 by their respective unions and employees returned to work on February 25, 2015. The respective collective bargaining agreements expire in August 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $48.9 million and $73.6 million of labor negotiation related expenses, respectively, primarily for contracted services, contingent workforce expenses (including training) and legal, communications and public relations expenses.\nUpon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements on February 22, 2015, a remeasurement of the net obligations of the represented employees pension plan and the represented employees post-employment benefit plan was required as of that date. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from February 23, 2015 to July 31, 2015 for the represented employee pension plan was determined using the remeasured obligation as of February 22, 2015 for that plan. As the result of a workforce reduction, a curtailment occurred related to the represented employee pension plan and a subsequent remeasurement of the net obligation was performed as of July 31, 2015. Accordingly, net periodic benefit cost from August 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was determined using the remeasured obligation as of July 31, 2015. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from February 23, 2015 to December 31, 2015 for the represented post-employment benefit Plan was determined using the remeasured obligation as of February 22, 2015 for that plan. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from January 1, 2015 to February 22, 2015 for these plans was determined using the respective net obligations as reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014.\nThe net pension obligation was $150.6 million at December 31, 2015, or a reduction of $62.2 million from $212.8 million at December 31, 2014. The net pension obligation includes the net obligation for certain management employees, which was not\naffected by the collective bargaining agreements, in addition to the represented employees pension plan.\nThe combined obligations for the post-employment benefit plans were $100.2 million at December 31, 2015 ($6.2 million in other accrued liabilities and $94.0 million in accrued other post-employment benefit obligations), or a reduction of $641.2 million from $741.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nFor 2015, we recognized an increase to our net long-term deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet due to a decrease in the deferred income tax asset associated with the qualified pension and other post-employment benefit obligations, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance. We do not expect a change in cash taxes or to our net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the remeasurement noted above.\nSee notes (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" and (11) \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information, as well as \"Results of Operations\" herein.\nRegulatory and Legislative\nWe are generally subject to common carrier regulation primarily by federal and state governmental agencies. At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over common carriers, such as us, to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over common carriers to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate intrastate telecommunications. In addition, pursuant to the Communications Act, state and federal regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing the domestic pro-competitive policies introduced by that legislation.\nWe are required to comply with the Communications Act which requires, among other things, that common carriers offer communication services at just and reasonable rates and on terms and conditions that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Communications Act also contains requirements intended to promote competition in the provision of local services and lead to deregulation as markets become more competitive.\nFor a detailed description of the federal and state regulatory environment in which we operate and the FCC's recently promulgated CAF/ICC Order and other recent regulatory changes, as well as the effects and potential effects of such regulation on us, see \"Item 1. Business-Regulatory and Legislative Environment\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The impact of these changes for 2015 is described further below. However, in the long run, we are uncertain of the ultimate impact as federal and state regulations continue to evolve.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe view our business of providing data, voice and communications services to business, wholesale and residential customers as one reportable segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified regulatory funding revenue to a separate line item from voice services and access revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 to be consistent with our current period presentation.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results reflected in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results (in thousands, except for operating metrics):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

business and residential customers, generally for a fixed monthly charge and service charges for special calling features. We also generate revenue through long distance services within our service areas on our network and through resale agreements with national interexchange carriers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, residential voice lines in service decreased 12.2%, 11.4% and 10.0% year-over-year, respectively, which directly impacts local voice services revenues and our opportunity to provide long distance services to our customers, resulting in a decrease of minutes of use. The decline in residential voice lines in 2015 and 2014 were partially due to the impact of the strike. Evolving competition, including reduced voice pricing from cable competitors as well as cellular adoption, has contributed to the decrease in residential voice lines. There are very few areas within our northern New England footprint where cable voice service and cellular are not alternatives for our customers. In addition, business voice services revenue also declined in part because of reduced access lines as businesses shifted from traditional voice products to our Ethernet or other advanced services. We expect the trend of decline in voice lines in service, and thereby a decline in aggregate voice services revenue, to continue as customers continue to turn to the use of alternative communication services as a result of ever-increasing competition.\nEffective June 1, 2015, the Performance Assurance Plan (\"PAP\") that was previously adopted in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont was retired and we began measuring and reporting certain wholesale local service performance\nresults pursuant to the terms of a simplified measurement plan. The new plan, called the Wholesale Performance Plan (\"WPP\"), was developed collaboratively with CLECs over several years and was approved by the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont regulatory commissions. Under the WPP, we are subject to significantly fewer performance criteria and our annual service penalty exposure was reduced from a maximum of $87 million to a maximum of $12 million ($4.75 million in each of Maine and New Hampshire and $2.5 million in Vermont). A portion of the penalty credits resulting from these commitments were recorded to voice services revenues; however, the majority were recorded to access revenues.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in voice services revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Local voice services revenues, excluding:\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(30.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long distance services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accrual of PAP/WPP service credits (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestiture of Idaho-based operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in accrual of SQI penalties (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in voice services revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(39.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(29.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAP and WPP service credits resulted in a decrease of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to local voice services revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2013, SQI penalties resulted in an increase of $0.1 million to local voice services revenues. There were no SQI penalties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Access Revenues\nWe receive revenues for the provision of network access through carrier Ethernet based products and legacy access products to end user customers and long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities to provide interexchange services to their customers. Network access can be provided to carriers and end users that buy dedicated local and interexchange capacity to support their private networks (i.e. special access) or it can be derived from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network (i.e. switched access).\nCarriers are migrating from legacy access products, such as DS1, DS3, frame relay, ATM and private line, to carrier Ethernet based products. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, wholesale Ethernet circuits grew by 17.1%, 44.4% and 76.8%, respectively. These carrier Ethernet based products are more sustainable, but generally, at the outset, have lower average revenue per user of broadband capacity than the legacy products they are replacing, resulting in a decline in access revenues. We expect the decline in access revenues to continue with customer migration. This decline in legacy access products is expected to be partially offset with the increasing need for bandwidth, including cellular backhaul and demand for carrier Ethernet based products, both of which are expected to increase over time. With the entry of cable competitors into the wholesale market, we continue to experience an increased decline in access lines due to this new competition. However, our extensive fiber-based Ethernet network with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable (of which approximately 17,000 miles are in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont), including approximately 1,300 cellular communications towers currently served with fiber, puts us in a position to grow our revenue base as demand for cellular backhaul and other Ethernet services expands. We also construct new fiber routes to cellular communications towers when the business case presents itself. Additionally, we continue to evaluate new services to provide to carriers, including the selective use of dark fiber and professional services, to continue to meet carrier access needs.\nAs described above, we adopted a separate PAP for certain services provided on a wholesale basis to CLECs in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, pursuant to which we are required to issue service credits in the event we are unable to meet the provisions of the respective PAP. These PAPs were retired effective June 1, 2015 and replaced with the WPP. Our maximum exposure to wholesale service credits has been reduced through the implementation of the WPP. The service credits are allocated to access revenues or voice services revenues based on services provided to the wholesale carrier.\nIn June 2014, Maine established a new POLR SQI standard, which may subject us to future SQI penalties.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in access revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrier Ethernet services (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy access services (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in revenues from special access pool (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accrual of PAP/WPP service credits (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestiture of Idaho-based operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in access revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We offer carrier Ethernet services throughout our market to our business and wholesale customers, which include Ethernet virtual circuit technology for cellular backhaul.

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $53.8 million, $45.6 million and $45.2 million, respectively, of regulatory funding revenues. The year-over-year changes are\nprimarily due to the transition CAF Phase II revenue we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. CAF Phase II support revenue does not include any for Colorado and Kansas. We expect the amount of regulatory funding revenue to decline as the amount of CAF Phase II transition funding decreases in 2016 and is phased out through 2018.\nOther Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues from other services, including special purpose projects on behalf of third parties, video services (including cable television and video-over-DSL), billing and collection, directory services, the sale and maintenance of customer premise equipment and certain other miscellaneous revenues. Other services revenues also include revenue we receive from late payment charges to end users and interexchange carriers.

We expect other post-employment benefits expense to increase once the prior service credit has been fully amortized.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in other post-employment benefit and pension expense (dollars in millions):\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other post-employment benefits expense (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(236.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension expense (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in other post-employment benefit and pension expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(245.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The decrease in the 2015 net periodic benefit cost compared to 2014 for our other post-employment benefit plans is primarily attributable to the benefit recognized from amortization of net prior service credits of $304.6 million partially offset by the amortization expense of the net actuarial loss of $113.4 million in 2015, a decrease in interest cost resulting from the lower obligation and a decrease in service cost due to elimination of benefits for active represented employees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in the 2014 net periodic benefit cost compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to an increase in interest cost resulting from an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to value the other post-employment benefit obligations, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses and service cost in 2014 compared to 2013.\nAt December 31, 2014, we recognized actuarial losses of $148.4 million, which resulted in an increase in the amount of actuarial losses being amortized in 2015 compared to 2014. At December 31, 2013, we recognized actuarial gains of $78.6 million, which resulted in a decrease in the amount of actuarial losses being amortized in 2014 compared to 2013. The actuarial gains/losses can be attributed primarily to the change in discount rates.\nSee note (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8.

The prior service credit is related to pension bands that were frozen under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in the 2014 net periodic benefit cost compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to a decrease in service cost and lower amortized actuarial losses.\nThe decrease in service cost in both 2015 and 2014 resulted from a reduction in the projected benefit obligation. The reduction in the projected benefit obligation used to measure service cost in 2015 is primarily the result of the collective bargaining agreements described in Labor Matters\u201d herein. The decrease in service cost in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to a reduction in the projected benefit obligation attributed to an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to value the qualified pension obligations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we recognized actuarial losses of $66.7 million, which resulted in an increase in the amount of actuarial losses being amortized in 2015 compared to 2014. At December 31, 2013, we recognized actuarial gains of $42.8 million, which resulted in a decrease in the amount of actuarial losses being amortized in 2014 compared to 2013. The actuarial gains/losses can be attributed primarily to the change in discount rates and the gains/losses incurred on payment of significant lump sums in each of those years.\nSee note (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information on our company-sponsored qualified pension plans.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense includes salaries and wages and benefits (including stock based compensation, but excluding the net periodic benefit cost of other post-employment benefit plans and qualified pension plans) not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, professional service fees and rent for administrative space. We expect SG&A expense in 2016 to decrease primarily due to lower labor negotiation related expense as a result of the execution of the collective bargaining agreements described in Labor Matters\u201d herein.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in SG&A expense (dollars in millions):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee expense (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Labor negotiation related expense (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance expense (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total changes in SG&A expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $101.8 million, $110.9 million and $123.7 million, respectively, of employee expense in SG&A expense. The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the work stoppage described in \"Labor Matters\" herein and reduction in headcount.

We require significant capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. Our capital expenditures in the coming years will be impacted by our CAF Phase II elections described in \"Regulatory and Legislative\" herein. We expect amortization expense to remain consistent throughout the remainder of our intangible assets' useful lives.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $212.8 million, $209.7 million and $271.3 million of depreciation expense, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher additions than retirements. The decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 was primarily related to certain asset classes becoming fully depreciated during 2013 and the impact of changes to the estimated remaining useful lives implemented in 2013. We recognized $11.0 million, $11.0 million and $11.1 million of amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nReorganization Related Expense/(Income)\nReorganization related expense/(income) represents amounts that have been recognized as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, occurring after the Effective Date. We will continue to incur expenses associated with the Chapter 11 Cases until all of the remaining claims have been closed. In addition, income may be recognized to the extent that we favorably settle outstanding claims in the claims reserve established to pay outstanding bankruptcy claims and various other bankruptcy related fees (the \"Claims Reserve\") or receive other payments related to the Chapter 11 Cases. As of December 31, 2015, the Claims Reserve had a balance of $0.2 million; however, the remaining claims were either paid or closed in the first quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table reflects a summary of interest expense recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively (in millions):\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Agreement Loans (as defined hereinafter)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes (as defined hereinafter)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Old credit agreement loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issue costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swap agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $0.3 million (0.4%) in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $1.7 million (2%) in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance fees related to the Credit Agreement Loans as a result of the Refinancing (as defined hereinafter in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\"), partially offset by lower weighted average long-term debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013.\nOn February 14, 2013, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes and entered into the Credit Agreement Loans, which include the $640.0 million Term Loan outstanding and the undrawn $75.0 million Revolving Facility (as defined hereinafter in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\"). The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement Loans accrues at an annual rate equal to either LIBOR or the base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. In addition, the Term Loan was issued at a $19.4 million discount, which is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2015, we were party to interest rate swap agreements.\nFor further information regarding the Credit Agreement Loans and the Notes, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" herein and note (7) \"Long-term Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nLoss on Debt Refinancing\nOn February 14, 2013, we completed the Refinancing (as defined hereinafter in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\") and paid all amounts outstanding under the old credit agreement. In connection with this Refinancing, we incurred $5.6 million in related fees and wrote off $1.2 million of debt issue costs and other prepayments related to the old credit agreement.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income generally includes non-operating gains and losses. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, net other income was $0.5 million, $7.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively. 2013 included a one-time settlement of $3.3 million.\nOn the Effective Date, as required by the Plan, the FairPoint Litigation Trust (the \"Trust\") was created and the Company transferred to the Trust the \"Litigation Trust Claims\", as defined in the FairPoint Litigation Trust Agreement among the Company, its subsidiaries and the trustee. The Trust thereafter settled the \"Litigation Trust Claims\" against Verizon Communications Inc. During 2014, we received payment from the settlement proceeds and recorded one-time, non-operating income of $6.7 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded a tax benefit on the income/(loss) from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $1.1 million, $29.8 million and $90.3 million, respectively, which equates to an effective tax rate of (1.2)%, 17.9% and 46.6%, respectively. For 2015, the effective tax rate differs from the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance as well as a tax benefit related to state taxes. A tax benefit recorded on pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in a negative effective tax rate. For 2014, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance offset by a tax benefit related to state taxes. For 2013, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, as well as a decrease to the valuation allowance.\nFor further information, see note (11) \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nGain on Sale of Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nOn January 31, 2013, we completed the sale of our capital stock in our Idaho-based operations to Blackfoot Telecommunications Group for $30.5 million in gross cash proceeds. The operating results of these Idaho-based operations were immaterial and, accordingly, were not segregated as discontinued operations for reporting purposes. A gain, before $6.7 million of income taxes, of $16.7 million was recorded upon the closing of the transaction, which is reported within discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nFor details of our Idaho-based operations' operating results, see note (17) \"Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and the adjustments to the most directly comparable GAAP measure used to determine the non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors in understanding period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. In addition, management believes the non-GAAP measures are useful for investors because they enable them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management. Management believes earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as adjusted to exclude the effect of items that are further described below (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), provides a useful measure of covenant compliance and Unlevered Free Cash Flow may be useful to investors in assessing the Company's ability to generate cash and meet its debt service requirements. The maintenance covenants contained in the Company's credit facility are based on Consolidated EBITDA, which is consistent with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA below.\nFor purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA (in accordance with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in our Credit Agreement), costs, expenses and charges related to the renegotiation of labor contracts including, but not limited to, expenses for third-party vendors and losses related to disruption of operations (including any associated penalties under service level agreements and regulatory performance plans) are permitted to be excluded from the calculation. We believe this includes, among others, the costs paid to third-parties for the contingent workforce and service quality penalties due to the disruption of operations. On October 17, 2014, two of our labor unions in northern New England initiated a work stoppage and returned to work on February 25, 2015. As a result, significant union employee and vehicle and other related expenses related to northern New England were not incurred between October 17, 2014 and February 24, 2015 (the \"work stoppage period\"). Therefore, to assist in the evaluation of the Company's operating performance without the impact of the work stoppage, we estimated the union employee and vehicle and other related expenses using historical data for the work stoppage period that we believe would have been incurred absent the work stoppage (\"Estimated Avoided Costs\"). Estimated Avoided Costs is a pro forma estimate only. Actual costs absent the strike\nmay have been different. In 2014 and 2015, had our incumbent workforce been in place, actual labor costs during the work stoppage period may have been higher than the $33 million and $27 million, respectively, recorded as Estimated Avoided Costs due to significant winter storm activity that increased our service demands; however, those incremental storm-related costs would have been an allowed add back to Adjusted EBITDA under the Credit Agreement. Estimated employee expenses avoided during the work stoppage period include salaries and wages, bonus, overtime, capitalized labor, benefits, payroll taxes, travel expenses and other employee related costs based on a trailing 12-month average calculated per striking employee per day during the work stoppage period less any actual expense incurred. Estimated vehicle fuel and maintenance expense savings, which resulted from the contingent workforce utilizing their own vehicles, for the work stoppage period were estimated based on a trailing 12-month average of historical costs less actual expense incurred. Management believes \"Adjusted EBITDA minus Estimated Avoided Costs\" and \"Unlevered Free Cash Flow minus Estimated Avoided Costs\" may be useful to investors in understanding our operating performance without the impact of the two unions' work stoppage in northern New England as described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income or loss, operating income, cash flow or other combined income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA minus Estimated Avoided Costs, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow minus Estimated Avoided Costs should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or reduce indebtedness. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using the non-GAAP measures only supplementally.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA minus Estimated Avoided Costs, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow minus Estimated Avoided Costs to net income/(loss) is provided in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 142:

EBITDA (in accordance with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the Company's credit agreement), the Company adjusts net income/(loss) for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, in addition to:\n(a)the add-back of aggregate pension and other post-employment benefits expense,\n(b)the add-back (or subtraction) of the adjustment to the compensated absences accrual to eliminate the impact of changes in the accrual,\n(c)the add-back of costs related to the reorganization, including professional fees for advisors and consultants,\n(d)the add-back of costs and expenses, including those imposed by regulatory authorities, with respect to casualty events, acts of God or force majeure to the extent they are not reimbursed from proceeds of insurance,\n(e)the add-back of other non-cash items, including stock compensation expense, except to the extent they will require a cash payment in a future period, and\n(f)the add-back (or subtraction) of other items, including facility and office closures, labor negotiation related expenses (including losses related to disruption of operations), non-cash gains/losses and non-operating dividend and interest income and other extraordinary gains/losses.\n(2)Unlevered Free Cash Flow refers to Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures, cash pension contributions and other post-employment benefits cash payments.\n(3)See paragraphs preceding the table above for information regarding the calculation of this non-GAAP measure.\n(4)On October 16, 2014, we received payment from the Trust settlement proceeds and recorded one-time, non-operating income of $6.7 million, which is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. For further information regarding this payment, see \"Results of Operations-Other Income\" included herein.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur current and future liquidity is dependent upon our operating results. We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be net cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and funds available under the Revolving Facility. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>interest and principal payments on our indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capital expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>working capital requirements as may be needed to support and grow our business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>contributions to our qualified pension plans and payments under our other post-employment benefit plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, the Revolving Facility and net cash provided by operating activities will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements for at least the next 12 months. We were in compliance with the maintenance covenants contained in the Credit Agreement (as defined hereinafter in \"Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\") through the end of 2015 and expect to remain in compliance for 2016.\nCash Flows\nCash at December 31, 2015 totaled $26.6 million compared to $37.6 million at December 31, 2014, excluding restricted cash of $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. During 2015, cash flows from operations of $112.0 million, which included outflows due to the scheduled semi-annual interest payments on the Notes and the payment of 2014 annual performance bonuses, were partially offset by cash outflows largely associated with $116.2 million of capital expenditures. During 2014, cash flows from operations of $121.1 million, which included outflows due to the scheduled semi-annual interest payments on the Notes and the payment of 2013 annual performance bonuses, were partially offset by cash outflows largely associated with $119.5 million of capital expenditures.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flow results reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(115.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities is our primary source of funds. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 decreased $9.1 million compared to 2014, primarily due to increased labor negotiation related expenses and a reduction in revenues partially offset by lower operating expenses as well as lower cash pension contributions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2014 decreased by $50.0 million compared to 2013, primarily due to a reduction in revenues, increased outflows for interest due to the timing of semi-annual payments on the Notes (as defined in \"Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\" below) in 2014 compared to 2013, as well as the full-year impact of higher interest rates resulting from financing, increased cash pension contributions and labor negotiation related expenses in 2014 compared to 2013.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities for 2015 decreased $2.5 million compared to 2014. Capital expenditures were $116.2 million, $119.5 million and $128.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2013, cash outflows in capital expenditures were partially offset by the sale of our Idaho-based operations during 2013 for $30.5 million in cash proceeds.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for 2015 decreased $0.7 million compared to 2014, primarily due to a reduction in repayments of capital lease obligations. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 decreased $47.8 million compared to 2013. This decrease is largely due to the Refinancing (as defined in \"Debt-February 2013 Refinancing\" below) during 2013.\nPension Contributions and Post-Employment Benefit Plan Expenditures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we contributed $15.0 million to our Company sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plans and funded benefit payments of $5.6 million under our post-employment benefit plans. Contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2015 exceeded the minimum funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\nOn August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act was signed into law. This act contained a pension funding stabilization provision which allows pension plan sponsors to use higher discount rate assumptions when determining the funded status and, accordingly, the funding obligations for its pension plans.\nThe provisions of the Act resulted in our 2015 minimum required pension plan contribution being lower than it would have been in the absence of this stabilization provision. We believe that the intent of the stabilization provision is to alter the timing of pension plan contributions, not to reduce the long-term funding of pension plans. Accordingly, the relief we will receive as a result of the stabilization provision may be temporary in nature in that our near-term minimum required contributions will be less than they otherwise would have been without the passage of this Act and will increase in the medium to long-term.\nIn 2016, we expect our aggregate cash pension contributions and cash post-employment benefit payments to be approximately $20 million. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-The amount we are required to contribute to our qualified pension plans and post-employment benefit plans is impacted by several factors that are beyond our control and changes in those factors may result in a significant increase in future cash contributions.\"\nCapital Expenditures\nWe require significant capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. In 2015, our net capital expenditures totaled $116.2 million, compared to $119.5 million in 2014. We anticipate that we will fund future capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and cash on hand (including amounts available under the Revolving Facility). In 2016, capital expenditures are expected to be between $115 million to $120 million. Our capital expenditures in the coming years will be impacted by our CAF Phase II elections as further described in \"Regulatory and Legislative\" herein.\nDebt\nFebruary 2013 Refinancing. On February 14, 2013 (the \"Refinancing Closing Date\"), we completed the refinancing of our old credit agreement (the \"Refinancing\"). In connection with the Refinancing, we (i) issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% senior secured notes due in 2019 (the \"Notes\") in a private offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to an indenture that we entered into on the Refinancing Closing Date (the \"Indenture\") and (ii) entered into a new credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), dated as of the Refinancing Closing Date. The Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0 million revolving credit facility, including a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $40.0 million in letters of credit (the \"Revolving Facility\"), and a $640.0 million term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\" and, together with the Revolving Facility, the \" Credit Agreement Loans\"). On the Refinancing Closing Date, we used the proceeds of the Notes offering, together with $640.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan and cash on hand to (i) repay principal of $946.5 million outstanding on the old term loan, plus approximately $7.7 million of accrued interest and (ii) pay approximately $32.6 million of fees, expenses and other costs related to the Refinancing.\nThe Credit Agreement. In connection with the Refinancing, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for the $75.0 million Revolving Facility, including a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $40.0 million in letters of credit, and the $640.0 million Term Loan. The principal amount of the Term Loan and commitments under the Revolving Facility may be increased by an aggregate amount up to $200.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions specified in the Credit Agreement. The Term\nLoan will mature on February 14, 2019 and the Revolving Facility will mature on February 14, 2018, subject in each case to extensions pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we had $60.8 million, net of $14.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility.\nInterest Rates and Fees. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement Loans accrue at an annual rate equal to either LIBOR or the base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. LIBOR is the per annum rate for an interest period of one, two, three or six months (at our election), with a minimum LIBOR floor of 1.25% for the Term Loan. The base rate for any date is the per annum rate equal to the greatest of (x) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (y) the rate of interest publicly quoted from time to time by The Wall Street Journal as the United States ''Prime Rate'' and (z) LIBOR with an interest period of one month plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the Term Loan is (a) 6.25% per annum with respect to term loans bearing interest based on LIBOR or (b) 5.25% per annum with respect to term loans bearing interest based on the base rate. The applicable rate for the Revolving Facility is, initially, (a) 5.50% with respect to revolving loans bearing interest based on LIBOR or (b) 4.50% per annum with respect to revolving loans bearing interest based on the base rate, in each case subject to adjustment based on our consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. We are required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee on the average daily amount available to be drawn under letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility equal to the applicable rate for revolving loans bearing interest based on LIBOR plus a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount available to be drawn under such letters of credit. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Facility, which is 0.50% initially, subject to reduction to 0.375% based on our consolidated total leverage ratio. In the third quarter of 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $170.0 million with three counterparties that are effective for a two year period beginning on September 30, 2015 and maturing on September 30, 2017. Each respective swap agreement requires us to pay a fixed rate of 2.665% and provides that we will receive a variable rate based on the three month LIBOR rate, subject to a minimum LIBOR floor of 1.25%. Amounts payable by or due to us will be net settled with the respective counterparties on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, commencing December 31, 2015. For further information regarding these agreements, see note (8) \"Interest Rate Swap Agreements\" to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSecurity/Guarantors. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, together with certain designated hedging obligations and cash management obligations, are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain subsidiaries of FairPoint Communications (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\") and secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all personal property of FairPoint Communications and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the related security documents, pari passu with the lien securing the obligations under the Notes.\nMandatory Repayments. We are required to make quarterly repayments of the Term Loan in a principal amount equal to $1.6 million during the term of the Credit Agreement, with such repayments being reduced based on the application of mandatory and optional prepayments of the Term Loan made from time to time. In addition, mandatory repayments are due under the Credit Agreement with (i) a percentage, initially equal to 50% and subject to reduction to 25% in subsequent fiscal years based on our consolidated total leverage ratio, of our excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement, (ii) the net cash proceeds of certain asset dispositions, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards and (iii) issuances of debt not permitted to be incurred under the Credit Agreement. Optional prepayments and mandatory prepayments resulting from the incurrence of debt not permitted to be incurred under the Credit Agreement were required to be made at 101.0% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid if such prepayment was made prior to February 14, 2016. No premium is required to be paid for prepayments made after February 14, 2016. We did not make any optional or mandatory prepayments under the Credit Agreement, excluding mandatory quarterly repayments discussed above, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment for fiscal year 2015.\nCovenants. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants for a transaction of this type, including two financial maintenance covenants: (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio and (ii) a consolidated total leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant limiting the maximum amount of capital expenditures that we and our subsidiaries may make in any fiscal year.\nEvents of Default. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default for a transaction of this type.\nThe Notes. On the Refinancing Closing Date, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture in a private offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act.\nThe terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture. The Notes are senior secured obligations of FairPoint Communications and are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all personal property of FairPoint Communications and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the related security documents, pari passu with the lien securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.\nOn or after February 15, 2016, we may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the applicable redemption date. Notes redeemed on or after February 15, 2016 and prior to February 15, 2017 may be redeemed at 104.375% of the aggregate principal amount; Notes redeemed on or after February 15, 2017 and prior to February 15, 2018 may be redeemed at 102.188% of the aggregate principal amount; and Notes redeemed on or after February 15, 2018 may be redeemed at their par value.\nThe holders of the Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase all or any part of the Notes if we experience certain kinds of changes in control or engage in certain asset sales, in each case at the repurchase prices and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants which are customary with respect to non-investment grade debt securities, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.\nThe Indenture also provides for customary events of default, including cross defaults to other specified debt of FairPoint Communications and certain of its subsidiaries.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 we had $14.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility and $4.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of surety bonds. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements other than our operating lease obligations, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. See -Summary of Contractual Obligations\u201d for further detail.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the periods in which payments are due (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\nthan\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nthan\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including current maturities (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>922,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>903,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including current maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (d)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,520,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>948,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Long-term debt obligations exclude outstanding letters of credit totaling $14.2 million under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2015.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allowance for doubtful accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accounting for qualified pension and other post-employment benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accounting for income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Depreciation of property, plant and equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Stock-based compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation of long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue Recognition. We recognize service revenues based upon usage of our local exchange network and facilities and contract fees. Fixed fees for voice services, Internet services and certain other services are recognized in the month the service is provided. Revenue from other services that are not fixed fee or that exceed contracted amounts is recognized when those services are provided. Non-recurring customer activation fees, along with the related costs up to, but not exceeding, the activation fees, are deferred and amortized over the customer relationship period. SQI penalties and certain PAP/WPP service credits are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nWe recognize certain revenues pursuant to various cost recovery programs from state and federal USF, CAF/ICC and from revenue sharing agreements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association (\"NECA\"). Revenues are calculated based on our investment in our network and other network operations and support costs. We have historically collected revenues recognized through this program; however, adjustments to estimated revenues in future periods are possible. These adjustments could be necessitated by adverse regulatory developments with respect to these subsidies and revenue sharing arrangements, changes in the allowable rates of return, the determination of recoverable costs and/or decreases in the availability of funds in the programs due to increased participation by other carriers.\nWe make estimated adjustments, as necessary, to revenue and accounts receivable for billing errors, including certain disputed amounts. If circumstances related to these adjustments change or our knowledge evolves, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided in our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. In evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customer's or carrier's ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nAccounting for Qualified Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits. Certain of our employees participate in our qualified pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. In the aggregate, the projected benefit obligations of the qualified pension plans exceed the fair value of their respective assets and the post-employment benefit plans do not have plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant qualified pension and other post-employment benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate-of-return on plan assets, and medical cost trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets and obligations reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The actuarial assumptions\nwe used in determining our qualified pension and post-employment benefit plans obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect our financial position or results of operations.\nOur qualified pension and post-employment benefit liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. We currently estimate that a movement of 1% in the discount rate would change our December 31, 2015 qualified pension plan benefit obligations by approximately 17%. We currently estimate that a 1% fluctuation in the discount rate would change our December 31, 2015 post-employment benefit obligations by approximately 12%.\nThe post-employment benefit obligations are also highly sensitive to the medical trend rate assumption. A 1% increase in the medical trend rate assumed for post-employment benefits at December 31, 2015 would result in an increase in the post-employment benefit obligations of approximately $10.9 million and a 1% decrease in the medical trend rate assumed at December 31, 2015 would result in a decrease in the post-employment benefit obligations of approximately $9.0 million.\nFor additional information on our qualified pension and post-employment benefit plans, see note (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management determines its estimates of future taxable income based upon the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is estimated to be more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized.\nFairPoint Communications files a consolidated income tax return with its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment. We recognize depreciation on property, plant and equipment principally on the composite group remaining life method and straight-line composite rates. This method provides for the recognition of the cost of the remaining net investment in telephone plant, less anticipated net salvage value (if any), over the remaining asset lives. When an asset is retired, the original cost, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation and no immediate gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the asset. Under this method, we review depreciable lives periodically and may revise depreciation rates when appropriate. The Company utilizes straight-line depreciation for its non-telephone property, plant and equipment.\nPeriodically, the Company reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of its group asset categories to address continuing changes in technology, competition and the Company's overall reduction in capital spending and increased focus on more efficient utilization of its existing assets.\nStock-based Compensation. Compensation expense for share-based awards made to employees and directors are recognized based on the estimated fair value of each award over the award's vesting period. We estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using one of the following: an option-pricing model for stock options; the closing market value of our stock for restricted stock and non-market performance share awards; and the Monte Carlo valuation model for market performance share awards. We expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period in the statement of operations. We assess the probability of achievement of the performance conditions for the non-market performance share awards at each period-end.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock option grants and the Monte Carlo valuation method to estimate the fair value of the market portion of the performance share awards. The key assumptions used include the expected life of the stock option, the expected dividend rate, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and potential total shareholder return outcomes. The expected life of the stock options granted represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rates are based on United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected life. The expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model reflects our historical\nvolatility. Our assumptions of these key inputs, in addition to our assumption made about the portion of the awards that will ultimately vest, requires subjective judgment.\nFor additional information on share-based awards, including key assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values, see note (15) \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets. We review our long-lived assets, which include our amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, we review non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever indicators of impairment exist. Indicators of impairment could include, but are not limited to:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an inability to perform at levels that were forecasted;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline in planned revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a permanent decline in market capitalization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>implementation of restructuring plans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in industry trends; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates or capital expenditures levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our only non-amortizable intangible asset is the FairPoint trade name. An annual quantitative impairment analysis was performed on October 1, 2015. We assess the fair value of our trade name utilizing the relief from royalty method. If the carrying amount of our trade name exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired. For this annual impairment review, we made certain assumptions including an estimated royalty rate, long-term growth rate, effective tax rate and discount rate and applied these assumptions to projected future cash flows, exclusive of cash flows associated with wholesale and other revenues not generated through brand recognition. As of October 1, 2015, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value; therefore, an impairment was not necessary. However, future changes in one or more of our assumptions discussed above may result in the recognition of an impairment loss.\nFor additional information on our FairPoint trade name, see note (5) \"Other Intangible Assets\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor details of recent Accounting Standards Updates and our evaluation of their adoption on our consolidated financial statements, see note (3) \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business, actions of regulatory authorities and competitors and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Executive Summary\n\u2022Labor Matters\n\u2022Regulatory and Legislative\n\u2022Basis of Presentation\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Summary of Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022New Accounting Standards\n\u2022Inflation\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of advanced communications services to business, wholesale and residential customers within our service territories. We offer our customers a suite of advanced services including Ethernet, SIP-Trunking, hosted PBX, managed services, data center colocation services, high capacity data transport and other IP-based services over our fiber-based network, in addition to Internet access, HSD and local and long distance voice services. Our service territory spans 17 states where we are the incumbent communications provider primarily serving rural communities and small urban markets. Many of our LECs have served their respective communities for more than 80 years. As of December 31, 2015, we operated with approximately 311,000 broadband subscribers, approximately 14,500 Ethernet circuits and approximately 410,000 residential voice lines.\nWe own and operate an extensive fiber-based Ethernet network with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable, including approximately 17,000 miles of fiber optic cable in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, giving us capacity to support more HSD services and extend our fiber reach into more communities across the region. The IP/MPLS network architecture of our fiber-based network allows us to provide Ethernet, transport and other IP-based services with the highest level of reliability at a lower cost of service. This fiber-based Ethernet network also supplies critical infrastructure for wireless carriers serving the region as their bandwidth needs increase, driven by mobile data from smartphones, tablets and other wireless devices. As of December 31, 2015, we provide cellular transport, also known as backhaul, through over 1,900 mobile Ethernet backhaul connections. We have fiber connectivity to approximately 1,300 cellular communications towers in our service footprint.\nExecutive Summary\nOur mission is to empower businesses, consumers and communities with advanced data, IT and voice services by leveraging our network, technology and operational expertise to exceed their expectations. Our vision includes operating and technology platforms that will meet our customers' technology needs by providing them with reliable and secure connections and ready access to what matters most to them.\nOur executive management team is focused on utilizing our network assets, our outstanding operating platform and our proven ability to develop and deploy market-driven products to build brand awareness, aid in generating new revenue and sustain existing revenue. We will enhance our network to bring new services and more robust technologies to our markets, enable effective and secure technology to ensure our product and service offerings remain competitive, and provide excellent customer service to create a loyal customer base, all while maintaining a sharp focus on managing costs.\nOur objective is to transform our revenue by continuing to add advanced data products and services such as Ethernet, high capacity data transport and other IP-based services over our fiber-based network in addition to HSD services, to minimize our dependence on voice access lines. Communications companies, including us, continue to experience a decline in access lines due to increased competition from wireless carriers, cable television operators and CLECs and increased availability of alternative communications services, including wireless and voice over IP (\"VoIP\"). We will continue our efforts to retain customers to mitigate the loss of voice access lines through bundled packages, including video and other value added services. We believe access lines as a measure of the business are increasingly less meaningful measures of trend and are being replaced by revenue generating broadband subscribers and Ethernet circuits.\nOver the past few years, we have made significant capital investments in our fiber-based Ethernet network to expand our business service offerings to meet the growing data needs of our customers and to increase broadband speeds and capacity in our consumer markets. We have also focused our sales and marketing efforts on these advanced data solutions. Specifically, within the last few years, we built and launched high capacity Ethernet services to allow us to meet the capacity needs of our business customers as well as supply high capacity infrastructure to our wholesale customers. In the past year, Ethernet demand has remained strong amid increased price pressure. We continue to see a market trend, largely led by cable companies, of reduced Ethernet prices to business and wholesale customers. We continue to see growth in Ethernet units and speeds amid declining prices in the market. These advanced data services are our flagship product and are laying the foundation not only for new business but also for additional IP-based voice services in the future.\nWe believe that our extensive fiber network, with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable, including approximately 17,000 miles of fiber optic cable in northern New England and 1,300 cellular communications towers currently served with fiber, puts us in an excellent position to serve the cellular backhaul needs in our markets. We further believe the bandwidth needs of cellular backhaul will grow with the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive technology. As a result, we expect to see wireless carriers developing new technologies as demand increases on existing fiber-connected towers, including the use of \"small cell\" architecture. By satisfying additional demand for bandwidth, both traditionally and through new and evolving technology, we expect to partially offset the decline we have seen, and expect to continue to see, in legacy wholesale offerings, including TDM transport services, DS1s, DS3s and wholesale switched access.\nCoupled with recent regulatory reform in the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont that will serve to promote fair competition among communications service providers in the region, we believe that there is a significant organic growth opportunity within the business and wholesale markets given our extensive fiber network and IP-based product suite, combined with our relative low market share in these areas.\nLabor Matters\nTwo of our collective bargaining agreements that covered approximately 1,700 employees in the aggregate in northern New England were ratified on February 22, 2015 by their respective unions and employees returned to work on February 25, 2015. The respective collective bargaining agreements expire in August 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $48.9 million and $73.6 million of labor negotiation related expenses, respectively, primarily for contracted services, contingent workforce expenses (including training) and legal, communications and public relations expenses.\nUpon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements on February 22, 2015, a remeasurement of the net obligations of the represented employees pension plan and the represented employees post-employment benefit plan was required as of that date. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from February 23, 2015 to July 31, 2015 for the represented employee pension plan was determined using the remeasured obligation as of February 22, 2015 for that plan. As the result of a workforce reduction, a curtailment occurred related to the represented employee pension plan and a subsequent remeasurement of the net obligation was performed as of July 31, 2015. Accordingly, net periodic benefit cost from August 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was determined using the remeasured obligation as of July 31, 2015. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from February 23, 2015 to December 31, 2015 for the represented post-employment benefit Plan was determined using the remeasured obligation as of February 22, 2015 for that plan. Net periodic benefit cost for the period from January 1, 2015 to February 22, 2015 for these plans was determined using the respective net obligations as reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014.\nThe net pension obligation was $150.6 million at December 31, 2015, or a reduction of $62.2 million from $212.8 million at December 31, 2014. The net pension obligation includes the net obligation for certain management employees, which was not\naffected by the collective bargaining agreements, in addition to the represented employees pension plan.\nThe combined obligations for the post-employment benefit plans were $100.2 million at December 31, 2015 ($6.2 million in other accrued liabilities and $94.0 million in accrued other post-employment benefit obligations), or a reduction of $641.2 million from $741.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nFor 2015, we recognized an increase to our net long-term deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet due to a decrease in the deferred income tax asset associated with the qualified pension and other post-employment benefit obligations, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance. We do not expect a change in cash taxes or to our net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the remeasurement noted above.\nSee notes (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" and (11) \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information, as well as \"Results of Operations\" herein.\nRegulatory and Legislative\nWe are generally subject to common carrier regulation primarily by federal and state governmental agencies. At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over common carriers, such as us, to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over common carriers to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate intrastate telecommunications. In addition, pursuant to the Communications Act, state and federal regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing the domestic pro-competitive policies introduced by that legislation.\nWe are required to comply with the Communications Act which requires, among other things, that common carriers offer communication services at just and reasonable rates and on terms and conditions that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Communications Act also contains requirements intended to promote competition in the provision of local services and lead to deregulation as markets become more competitive.\nFor a detailed description of the federal and state regulatory environment in which we operate and the FCC's recently promulgated CAF/ICC Order and other recent regulatory changes, as well as the effects and potential effects of such regulation on us, see \"Item 1. Business-Regulatory and Legislative Environment\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The impact of these changes for 2015 is described further below. However, in the long run, we are uncertain of the ultimate impact as federal and state regulations continue to evolve.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe view our business of providing data, voice and communications services to business, wholesale and residential customers as one reportable segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified regulatory funding revenue to a separate line item from voice services and access revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 to be consistent with our current period presentation.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results reflected in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results (in thousands, except for operating metrics):\n\nVoice Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues through the provision of local calling services to business and residential customers, generally for a fixed monthly charge and service charges for special calling features. We also generate revenue through long distance services within our service areas on our network and through resale agreements with national interexchange carriers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, residential voice lines in service decreased 12.2%, 11.4% and 10.0% year-over-year, respectively, which directly impacts local voice services revenues and our opportunity to provide long distance services to our customers, resulting in a decrease of minutes of use. The decline in residential voice lines in 2015 and 2014 were partially due to the impact of the strike. Evolving competition, including reduced voice pricing from cable competitors as well as cellular adoption, has contributed to the decrease in residential voice lines. There are very few areas within our northern New England footprint where cable voice service and cellular are not alternatives for our customers. In addition, business voice services revenue also declined in part because of reduced access lines as businesses shifted from traditional voice products to our Ethernet or other advanced services. We expect the trend of decline in voice lines in service, and thereby a decline in aggregate voice services revenue, to continue as customers continue to turn to the use of alternative communication services as a result of ever-increasing competition.\nEffective June 1, 2015, the Performance Assurance Plan (\"PAP\") that was previously adopted in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont was retired and we began measuring and reporting certain wholesale local service performance\nresults pursuant to the terms of a simplified measurement plan. The new plan, called the Wholesale Performance Plan (\"WPP\"), was developed collaboratively with CLECs over several years and was approved by the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont regulatory commissions. Under the WPP, we are subject to significantly fewer performance criteria and our annual service penalty exposure was reduced from a maximum of $87 million to a maximum of $12 million ($4.75 million in each of Maine and New Hampshire and $2.5 million in Vermont). A portion of the penalty credits resulting from these commitments were recorded to voice services revenues; however, the majority were recorded to access revenues.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in voice services revenues (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAP and WPP service credits resulted in a decrease of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to local voice services revenues. \n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2013, SQI penalties resulted in an increase of $0.1 million to local voice services revenues. There were no SQI penalties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Access Revenues\nWe receive revenues for the provision of network access through carrier Ethernet based products and legacy access products to end user customers and long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities to provide interexchange services to their customers. Network access can be provided to carriers and end users that buy dedicated local and interexchange capacity to support their private networks (i.e. special access) or it can be derived from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network (i.e. switched access).\nCarriers are migrating from legacy access products, such as DS1, DS3, frame relay, ATM and private line, to carrier Ethernet based products. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, wholesale Ethernet circuits grew by 17.1%, 44.4% and 76.8%, respectively. These carrier Ethernet based products are more sustainable, but generally, at the outset, have lower average revenue per user of broadband capacity than the legacy products they are replacing, resulting in a decline in access revenues. We expect the decline in access revenues to continue with customer migration. This decline in legacy access products is expected to be partially offset with the increasing need for bandwidth, including cellular backhaul and demand for carrier Ethernet based products, both of which are expected to increase over time. With the entry of cable competitors into the wholesale market, we continue to experience an increased decline in access lines due to this new competition. However, our extensive fiber-based Ethernet network with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable (of which approximately 17,000 miles are in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont), including approximately 1,300 cellular communications towers currently served with fiber, puts us in a position to grow our revenue base as demand for cellular backhaul and other Ethernet services expands. We also construct new fiber routes to cellular communications towers when the business case presents itself. Additionally, we continue to evaluate new services to provide to carriers, including the selective use of dark fiber and professional services, to continue to meet carrier access needs.\nAs described above, we adopted a separate PAP for certain services provided on a wholesale basis to CLECs in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, pursuant to which we are required to issue service credits in the event we are unable to meet the provisions of the respective PAP. These PAPs were retired effective June 1, 2015 and replaced with the WPP. Our maximum exposure to wholesale service credits has been reduced through the implementation of the WPP. The service credits are allocated to access revenues or voice services revenues based on services provided to the wholesale carrier.\nIn June 2014, Maine established a new POLR SQI standard, which may subject us to future SQI penalties.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in access revenues (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) We offer carrier Ethernet services throughout our market to our business and wholesale customers, which include Ethernet virtual circuit technology for cellular backhaul. As of December 31, 2015, we provide cellular transport on our fiber-based Ethernet network through over 1,900 fiber-to-the-tower connections compared to over 1,700 and 1,300 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n (2) Legacy access services include products such as DS1, DS3, frame relay, ATM and private line. \n (3) In July 2013, we discontinued participation for wholesale DSL services within the National Exchange Carrier Association (\"NECA\") special access rate of return pool for our remaining rural operating companies. \n (4) During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAP and WPP service credits resulted in a decrease of $1.0 million, $1.2 million and $3.6 million to access revenues, respectively.  Data and Internet Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues from monthly recurring charges for the provision of data and Internet services to residential and business customers through DSL technology, fiber-to-the-home technology, retail Ethernet, Internet dial-up, high speed cable modem and wireless broadband.\nWe have invested in our broadband network to extend the reach and capacity of the network to customers who did not previously have access to data and Internet products and to offer more competitive services to existing customers, including retail Ethernet products. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, retail Ethernet circuits grew by 12.4%, 20.5%, and 45.2% respectively. Our broadband subscribers decreased by 2.7% and 2.5% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and grew by 1.0% during the year ended December 31, 2013, which directly impacts data and Internet services revenues. We expect to continue our investment in our broadband network to further grow data and Internet services revenues in the coming years.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in data and Internet services revenues (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Retail Ethernet services revenue is comprised of data services provided through E-LAN, E-LINE and E-DIA technology on our fiber-based Ethernet network. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $42.4 million, $37.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of retail Ethernet revenues. \n (2) Includes all other services such as DSL, dial-up, high speed cable modem and wireless broadband.  Regulatory Funding Revenues\nWe receive certain federal and state government funding that we classify as regulatory funding, which is further described in Regulatory and Legislative\u201d herein, including: CAF Phase II support effective January 1, 2015 to build and operate broadband services; CAF Phase II transition funding (scheduled to phase down over three years); CAF Phase I frozen support (for Kansas and Colorado in 2015 and until a reverse auction is completed); CAF funding under the CAF/ICC Order; and universal service fund support from certain states in which we operate. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $53.8 million, $45.6 million and $45.2 million, respectively, of regulatory funding revenues. The year-over-year changes are\nprimarily due to the transition CAF Phase II revenue we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. CAF Phase II support revenue does not include any for Colorado and Kansas. We expect the amount of regulatory funding revenue to decline as the amount of CAF Phase II transition funding decreases in 2016 and is phased out through 2018.\nOther Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues from other services, including special purpose projects on behalf of third parties, video services (including cable television and video-over-DSL), billing and collection, directory services, the sale and maintenance of customer premise equipment and certain other miscellaneous revenues. Other services revenues also include revenue we receive from late payment charges to end users and interexchange carriers. Due to the composition of other services revenues, it is difficult to predict future trends.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in other services revenues (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Special purpose projects are completed on behalf of third party requests. \n (2) Late payment fees are related to customers who have not paid their bills in a timely manner. \n (3) Other revenues were primarily attributable to fluctuations in directory services, billing and collections and various other miscellaneous services revenues.  Supplementary revenue information. In addition to the revenue information discussed above, we are providing the following additional strategic revenue categorization information. Management believes that providing this additional revenue information will afford better visibility into our revenue trends as a result of product and service evolution within our industry. Management believes these metrics will enhance investors' ability to evaluate our business and assist investors in their understanding of the changing composition of our revenue (in millions).\n\n(1) Growth revenue is comprised of products and services that are generally viewed as in-demand by communications consumers over the medium- to long-term and are expected to increase over time.\na) Broadband revenue is comprised of both residential and business customers delivered through DSL, ADSL, VDSL or other similar services.\nb) Ethernet revenue includes Ethernet over copper (\"EOC\") or Ethernet over fiber (\"EOF\") services delivered to end-users or to wholesalers, who then sell to their end-users.\nc) Hosted and Advanced Services includes VoIP and other digital voice services including unified messaging and other IP features as well as revenue generated from our various advanced services including the next-generation emergency 9-1-1 contracts in several of our service territories as well as data center colocation and managed services.\n(2) Convertible revenues are revenues that could move from", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements.

The respective collective bargaining agreements expire in August 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $48.9 million and $73.6 million of labor negotiation related expenses, respectively, primarily for contracted services, contingent workforce expenses (including training) and legal, communications and public relations expenses.\nUpon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements on February 22, 2015, a remeasurement of the net obligations of the represented employees pension plan and the represented employees post-employment benefit plan was required as of that date.

Net periodic benefit cost for the period from January 1, 2015 to February 22, 2015 for these plans was determined using the respective net obligations as reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014.\nThe net pension obligation was $150.6 million at December 31, 2015, or a reduction of $62.2 million from $212.8 million at December 31, 2014. The net pension obligation includes the net obligation for certain management employees, which was not\naffected by the collective bargaining agreements, in addition to the represented employees pension plan.\nThe combined obligations for the post-employment benefit plans were $100.2 million at December 31, 2015 ($6.2 million in other accrued liabilities and $94.0 million in accrued other post-employment benefit obligations), or a reduction of $641.2 million from $741.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nFor 2015, we recognized an increase to our net long-term deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet due to a decrease in the deferred income tax asset associated with the qualified pension and other post-employment benefit obligations, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance. We do not expect a change in cash taxes or to our net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the remeasurement noted above.\nSee notes (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" and (11) \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information, as well as \"Results of Operations\" herein.\nRegulatory and Legislative\nWe are generally subject to common carrier regulation primarily by federal and state governmental agencies. At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over common carriers, such as us, to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over common carriers to the extent those carriers provide, originate or terminate intrastate telecommunications. In addition, pursuant to the Communications Act, state and federal regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing the domestic pro-competitive policies introduced by that legislation.\nWe are required to comply with the Communications Act which requires, among other things, that common carriers offer communication services at just and reasonable rates and on terms and conditions that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Communications Act also contains requirements intended to promote competition in the provision of local services and lead to deregulation as markets become more competitive.\nFor a detailed description of the federal and state regulatory environment in which we operate and the FCC's recently promulgated CAF/ICC Order and other recent regulatory changes, as well as the effects and potential effects of such regulation on us, see \"Item 1. Business-Regulatory and Legislative Environment\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The impact of these changes for 2015 is described further below. However, in the long run, we are uncertain of the ultimate impact as federal and state regulations continue to evolve.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe view our business of providing data, voice and communications services to business, wholesale and residential customers as one reportable segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified regulatory funding revenue to a separate line item from voice services and access revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 to be consistent with our current period presentation.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results reflected in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results (in thousands, except for operating metrics):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

business and residential customers, generally for a fixed monthly charge and service charges for special calling features. We also generate revenue through long distance services within our service areas on our network and through resale agreements with national interexchange carriers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, residential voice lines in service decreased 12.2%, 11.4% and 10.0% year-over-year, respectively, which directly impacts local voice services revenues and our opportunity to provide long distance services to our customers, resulting in a decrease of minutes of use. The decline in residential voice lines in 2015 and 2014 were partially due to the impact of the strike. Evolving competition, including reduced voice pricing from cable competitors as well as cellular adoption, has contributed to the decrease in residential voice lines. There are very few areas within our northern New England footprint where cable voice service and cellular are not alternatives for our customers. In addition, business voice services revenue also declined in part because of reduced access lines as businesses shifted from traditional voice products to our Ethernet or other advanced services. We expect the trend of decline in voice lines in service, and thereby a decline in aggregate voice services revenue, to continue as customers continue to turn to the use of alternative communication services as a result of ever-increasing competition.\nEffective June 1, 2015, the Performance Assurance Plan (\"PAP\") that was previously adopted in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont was retired and we began measuring and reporting certain wholesale local service performance\nresults pursuant to the terms of a simplified measurement plan. The new plan, called the Wholesale Performance Plan (\"WPP\"), was developed collaboratively with CLECs over several years and was approved by the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont regulatory commissions. Under the WPP, we are subject to significantly fewer performance criteria and our annual service penalty exposure was reduced from a maximum of $87 million to a maximum of $12 million ($4.75 million in each of Maine and New Hampshire and $2.5 million in Vermont). A portion of the penalty credits resulting from these commitments were recorded to voice services revenues; however, the majority were recorded to access revenues.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in voice services revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Local voice services revenues, excluding:\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(30.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(24.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long distance services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accrual of PAP/WPP service credits (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestiture of Idaho-based operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in accrual of SQI penalties (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in voice services revenues\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(39.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(29.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAP and WPP service credits resulted in a decrease of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to local voice services revenues. \n (2) During the year ended December 31, 2013, SQI penalties resulted in an increase of $0.1 million to local voice services revenues. There were no SQI penalties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Access Revenues\nWe receive revenues for the provision of network access through carrier Ethernet based products and legacy access products to end user customers and long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities to provide interexchange services to their customers. Network access can be provided to carriers and end users that buy dedicated local and interexchange capacity to support their private networks (i.e. special access) or it can be derived from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network (i.e. switched access).\nCarriers are migrating from legacy access products, such as DS1, DS3, frame relay, ATM and private line, to carrier Ethernet based products. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, wholesale Ethernet circuits grew by 17.1%, 44.4% and 76.8%, respectively. These carrier Ethernet based products are more sustainable, but generally, at the outset, have lower average revenue per user of broadband capacity than the legacy products they are replacing, resulting in a decline in access revenues. We expect the decline in access revenues to continue with customer migration. This decline in legacy access products is expected to be partially offset with the increasing need for bandwidth, including cellular backhaul and demand for carrier Ethernet based products, both of which are expected to increase over time. With the entry of cable competitors into the wholesale market, we continue to experience an increased decline in access lines due to this new competition. However, our extensive fiber-based Ethernet network with more than 21,000 miles of fiber optic cable (of which approximately 17,000 miles are in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont), including approximately 1,300 cellular communications towers currently served with fiber, puts us in a position to grow our revenue base as demand for cellular backhaul and other Ethernet services expands. We also construct new fiber routes to cellular communications towers when the business case presents itself. Additionally, we continue to evaluate new services to provide to carriers, including the selective use of dark fiber and professional services, to continue to meet carrier access needs.\nAs described above, we adopted a separate PAP for certain services provided on a wholesale basis to CLECs in each of the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, pursuant to which we are required to issue service credits in the event we are unable to meet the provisions of the respective PAP. These PAPs were retired effective June 1, 2015 and replaced with the WPP. Our maximum exposure to wholesale service credits has been reduced through the implementation of the WPP. The service credits are allocated to access revenues or voice services revenues based on services provided to the wholesale carrier.\nIn June 2014, Maine established a new POLR SQI standard, which may subject us to future SQI penalties.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in access revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrier Ethernet services (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy access services (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in revenues from special access pool (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in accrual of PAP/WPP service credits (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divestiture of Idaho-based operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in access revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We offer carrier Ethernet services throughout our market to our business and wholesale customers, which include Ethernet virtual circuit technology for cellular backhaul. As of December 31, 2015, we provide cellular transport on our fiber-based Ethernet network through over 1,900 fiber-to-the-tower connections compared to over 1,700 and 1,300 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n (2) Legacy access services include products such as DS1, DS3, frame relay, ATM and private line. \n (3) In July 2013, we discontinued participation for wholesale DSL services within the National Exchange Carrier Association (\"NECA\") special access rate of return pool for our remaining rural operating companies. \n (4) During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAP and WPP service credits resulted in a decrease of $1.0 million, $1.2 million and $3.6 million to access revenues, respectively.  Data and Internet Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues from monthly recurring charges for the provision of data and Internet services to residential and business customers through DSL technology, fiber-to-the-home technology, retail Ethernet, Internet dial-up, high speed cable modem and wireless broadband.\nWe have invested in our broadband network to extend the reach and capacity of the network to customers who did not previously have access to data and Internet products and to offer more competitive services to existing customers, including retail Ethernet products. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, retail Ethernet circuits grew by 12.4%, 20.5%, and 45.2% respectively. Our broadband subscribers decreased by 2.7% and 2.5% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and grew by 1.0% during the year ended December 31, 2013, which directly impacts data and Internet services revenues. We expect to continue our investment in our broadband network to further grow data and Internet services revenues in the coming years.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in data and Internet services revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Ethernet services (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other data and Internet technology based services (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in data and Internet revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Retail Ethernet services revenue is comprised of data services provided through E-LAN, E-LINE and E-DIA technology on our fiber-based Ethernet network. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $42.4 million, $37.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively, of retail Ethernet revenues. \n (2) Includes all other services such as DSL, dial-up, high speed cable modem and wireless broadband.  Regulatory Funding Revenues\nWe receive certain federal and state government funding that we classify as regulatory funding, which is further described in Regulatory and Legislative\u201d herein, including: CAF Phase II support effective January 1, 2015 to build and operate broadband services; CAF Phase II transition funding (scheduled to phase down over three years); CAF Phase I frozen support (for Kansas and Colorado in 2015 and until a reverse auction is completed); CAF funding under the CAF/ICC Order; and universal service fund support from certain states in which we operate. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $53.8 million, $45.6 million and $45.2 million, respectively, of regulatory funding revenues. The year-over-year changes are\nprimarily due to the transition CAF Phase II revenue we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. CAF Phase II support revenue does not include any for Colorado and Kansas. We expect the amount of regulatory funding revenue to decline as the amount of CAF Phase II transition funding decreases in 2016 and is phased out through 2018.\nOther Services Revenues\nWe receive revenues from other services, including special purpose projects on behalf of third parties, video services (including cable television and video-over-DSL), billing and collection, directory services, the sale and maintenance of customer premise equipment and certain other miscellaneous revenues. Other services revenues also include revenue we receive from late payment charges to end users and interexchange carriers. Due to the composition of other services revenues, it is difficult to predict future trends.\nThe following table reflects the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in other services revenues (dollars in millions):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 vs. December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special purpose projects (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late payment fees (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in other services revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Special purpose projects are completed on behalf of third party requests. \n (2) Late payment fees are related to customers who have not paid their bills in a timely manner. \n (3) Other revenues were primarily attributable to fluctuations in directory services, billing and collections and various other miscellaneous services revenues.
