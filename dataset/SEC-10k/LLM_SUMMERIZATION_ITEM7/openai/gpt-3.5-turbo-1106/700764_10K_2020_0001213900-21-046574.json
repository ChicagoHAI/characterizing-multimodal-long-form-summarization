MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. MD&A is presented in the following seven sections:\nTable 60: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Business Overview; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Results of Operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Recently Adopted Accounting Standards; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Recently Issued Accounting Standards. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and our audited consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes thereto.\nIn MD&A, we use we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Victory\u201d and the Company\u201d to refer to Victory Oilfield Tech. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context requires otherwise. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. We caution readers that important facts and factors described in MD&A and elsewhere in this document sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect our actual results, and could cause our actual results during 2021 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us.\nAs reported in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements, we have suffered recurring losses from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nMany statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In particular, the words anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d suggests,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d estimates,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d forecast,\u201d variations of such words, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:\nTable 67: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continued operating losses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>adverse developments in economic conditions and, particularly, in conditions in the oil and gas industries; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our inability to successfully execute on our growth strategy; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the competitive nature of our industry; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>credit risk exposure from our customers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>price increases or business interruptions in our supply of raw materials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>failure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>business disruptions, security threats and security breaches, including security risks to our information technology systems; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>failure to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>risks associated with protecting data privacy; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>significant environmental liabilities and costs as a result of our current and past operations or products, including operations or products related to our licensed coating materials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>transporting certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>litigation and other commitments and contingencies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>ability to recruit and retain the experienced and skilled personnel we need to compete; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>work stoppages, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>delays in obtaining permits by our future customers or acquisition targets for their operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>intellectual property infringement suits against us by third parties; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and divestitures; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>risk that the insurance we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>risks associated with changes in tax rates or regulations, including unexpected impacts of the new U.S. TCJA legislation, which may differ with further regulatory guidance and changes in our current interpretations and assumptions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our substantial indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the results of pending litigation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other factors beyond our control. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. Potential investors should not make an investment decision based solely on our projections, estimates or expectations.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are an Austin, Texas based publicly held oilfield energy technology products company focused on improving well performance and extending the lifespan of the industry's most sophisticated and expensive equipment. America's resurgence in oil and gas production is largely driven by new innovative technologies and processes as most dramatically and recently demonstrated by fracking. One such process is hardbanding, in which a wear-resistant alloy is applied to the tool joints of drillpipe or drill collars to prolong the life of oilfield tubulars. We utilize wear-resistant alloys which are mechanically stronger, harder and more corrosion resistant than typical alloys found in the market today. This combination of characteristics creates opportunities for drillers to dramatically improve lateral drilling lengths, well completion time and total well costs.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe plan to continue our U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already recognized as a high-quality services provider to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, we expect that each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our existing products and services. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.\nWe believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the Company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy.\nRecent Developments\nImpact of Coronavirus Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Most states and cities have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, stay-at-home\u201d rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.\nAlthough stay at home orders and lock downs on businesses in the areas where we operate have caused our staff to conduct business operations from their homes, this change has not resulted in a significant impact to our ability to operate. However, the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the world has driven sharp demand destruction for crude oil as whole economies ordered curtailed activity. As a result, companies across the industry have responded with severe capital spending budget cuts, personnel layoffs, facility closures and bankruptcy filings. We expect industry activity levels and spending by customers to remain depressed throughout the remainder of 2021 as destruction of demand for oil and gas continues.\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our operators, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent of the pandemic's continued effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the pace at which jurisdictions across the country re-open and restrictions begin to lift, the availability of government financial support to our business and our customers, and whether a resurgence of the outbreak occurs. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, but it could be material.\nVPEG Note\nDuring the period of January 1, 2021 through August 20, 2021 we received additional loan proceeds of $278,100 from VPEG pursuant to the New VPEG Note (See Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the New VPEG Note).\nOn January 31, 2021 we and VPEG entered into an amendment to the New Debt Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d pursuant to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $3,500,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nOn September 3, 2021 we and VPEG entered into Amendment No. 3 to the New Debt Agreement to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $4,000,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nPPP Note\nAs of August 6, 2021 we have received notice from Arvest Bank and the SBA that the full amount of the first PPP Note for $168,800 has been forgiven. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The amount forgiven will be recorded as income in our financial statements as of the date of forgiveness.\nOn February 1, 2021, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $98,622 pursuant to a second draw loan under the PPP. The unsecured loan (the Second PPP Loan\u201d) is evidenced by a promissory note (the Second PPP Note\u201d) issued by us, dated January 28, 2021, in the principal amount of $98,622 with Arvest Bank.\nUnder the terms of the Second PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first 10 months. The term of the Second PPP Note is five years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Second PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the Second PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a 10-month deferral period provided in the Second PPP Note and through January 28, 2026.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for forgiveness for all or a part of the Second PPP Loan. The amount of Second PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on Second PPP Loan forgiveness, only that portion of the Second PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty-four -week period will qualify for forgiveness. Although we have used the entire amount of the Second PPP Loan for qualifying expenses, no assurance is provided that we will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan in whole or in part.\nThe Second PPP Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Second PPP Note provide for certain customary events of default, including our: (i) failure to make a payment when due; (ii) breach of the note terms; (iii) default on any other loan with the Lender; (iv) filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against us; (v) reorganization merger, consolidation or other change in ownership or business structure without the Lender's prior written consent; (vi) adverse change in financial condition or business operation that the Lender believes may affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note; and (vii) default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if the Lender believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender has customary remedies and may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owed under the Second PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from us and file suit and obtain judgment against us.\nThe foregoing description of the Second PPP Note does not purport to be complete is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.\nFilings with the SEC\nOn September 16, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) adopted extensive amendments to Rule 15c2-11 ( Rule\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act\u201d). The Rule governs the publication of quotations for securities in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, including the OTC Pink Market where our common stock is quoted. Rule 15c2-11 makes it unlawful for a broker-dealer to initiate a quotation for a security unless the broker dealer has in its records prescribed information about the issuer that is current and publicly available. The lack of full time accounting personnel and financial constraints resulting in delayed payments to our external professional services providers have restricted our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. For these reasons, we were unable to timely file our quarterly and annual reports during 2019 and 2020 and our quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of 2021. We continue to actively seek additional sources of capital which we believe will allow the resumption of timely current public reporting practices no later than the third quarter of 2021.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nTotal revenue\nWe generate revenue from hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars and grinding services.\nOur revenues are generally impacted by the following factors:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to successfully develop and launch new solutions and services </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>changes in buying habits of our customers </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>changes in the level of competition faced by our products </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>domestic drilling activity and spending by the oil and natural gas industry in the United States </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of revenue\nThe costs associated with generating our revenue fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes, average selling prices, product mix, and changes in the price of raw materials and consist primarily of the following:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hardbanding production materials purchases </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hardbanding supplies </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>labor </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>depreciation expense for hardbanding equipment </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>field expenses </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nOur selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as administrative overhead costs, including:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, which includes share-based compensation expense </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>rent expense, communications expense, and maintenance and repair costs </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees and insurance expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese expenses are not expected to materially increase or decrease directly with changes in total revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation of hardbanding equipment which is reported in Total cost of revenue\nInterest expense\nInterest expense, net consists primary of interest expense and loan fees on borrowings as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our indebtedness.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, from various non-operating items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, interest income, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, as well as non-operational gains and losses unrelated to our core business.\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\nWe are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, our operating results, the availability of any net operating loss carryforwards, any future business combinations, and changes to tax laws and regulations are key factors that will determine our future book and taxable income.\nIncome from discontinued operations\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues, related expenses and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

by 61%, from $2,204,104 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $851,393 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in hardbanding revenue generated by Pro-Tech as a result of as a result of less drilling due to the low price of a barrel of oil and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for oil and gas.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by 47%, from $1,015,855 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $537,427 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to decreases in materials, direct labor, other direct costs resulting from decreases in Pro-Tech's revenue generating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and to a lesser extent, other reductions in expenses such as depreciation on equipment.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 32%, from $1,705,704 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,165,009 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Consulting fees were reduced by eliminating the number of consultants and moving others to payroll </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Payroll related expenses were reduced due to employee downsizing </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Premiums for Directors and Officers liability insurance were reduced </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese decreases were partially offset by increases in accounting fees.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by 93%, from $265,318 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $19,609 during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the reduction of amortization of Intangible Assets, which were impaired at the end of 2019. In addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nImpairment loss\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairments to the AVV Sublicense, the Trademark License and the Non-Compete Agreements of $2,214,167, $1,182,500 and $67,500, respectively, which net of accumulated amortization of $847,462 represented 100% of the remaining value of each of these assets, for a total impairment loss of $2,616,705.\nIn addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by 56%, from $197,851 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87,677 in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the restructuring of our notes payable to VPEG as well as the Rogers Note, the Kodak Note, and the Matheson Note. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.\nTax benefit\nThere is no material provision for income tax expenses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to the net operating losses, ( NOL\u201d) in each of the respective years. The realization of future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income within the NOL carry forward period. Given our history of net operating losses, management has determined that it is more-likely-than-not we will not be able to realize the tax benefit of our NOL carry forwards. Current standards require that a valuation allowance thus be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Income from Discontinued Operations, and Loss Applicable to Common Stockholders\nWe reported an operating loss for 2020 of $(953,858) compared to an operating loss of $(3,530,835) for 2019.\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues and related expenses resulting from the trailing activity of Aurora and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs a result of the foregoing, loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(953,858), or $(0.03) per share, compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of $(3,530,835), or $(0.13) per share, for 2019 on weighted average shares of 28,037,713 in each of the respective periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGoing Concern\nHistorically we have experienced, and we continue to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities, and working capital deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement anticipates that operating losses will continue in the near term as we continue efforts to leverage our intellectual property through the platform provided by the acquisition of Pro-Tech and, potentially, other acquisitions. In the near term, we are relying on financing obtained from VPEG through the New VPEG Note to fund operations as we seek to generate positive cash flows from operations. See Note 8 Notes Payable,\u201d and Note 13 Related Party Transactions,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the New VPEG Note. In addition to increasing cash flow from operations, we will be required to obtain other liquidity resources in order to support ongoing operations. We are addressing this need by developing additional capital sources which we believe will enable us to execute our recapitalization and growth plan. This plan includes the expansion of Pro-Tech's core hardbanding business through additional drilling services and the development of additional products and services including wholesale materials, RFID enclosures and mid-pipe coating solutions.\nBased upon capital formation activities as well as the ongoing near-term funding provided through the New VPEG Note, we believe we will have enough capital to cover expenses through at least the next twelve months. We will continue to monitor liquidity carefully, and in the event we do not have enough capital to cover expenses, we will make the necessary and appropriate reductions in spending to remain cash flow positive.\nCapital Resources\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we obtained $1,102,776 from VPEG through the New VPEG Note. As of August 20, 2021 and for the foreseeable future, we expect to cover operating shortfalls with funding through the New VPEG Note while we enact our strategy to become a technology-focused oilfield services company and seek additional sources of capital. As of August 20, 2021 the remaining amount available to us for additional borrowings on the New VPEG Note, as amended, was approximately $640,224.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nOn April 15, 2020, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $168,800 under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP\u201d). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act\u201d) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA\u201d), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The unsecured loan (the First PPP Loan\u201d) is evidenced by a promissory note (the First PPP Note\u201d) issued by us, dated April 14, 2020, in the principal amount of $168,800 with Arvest Bank\nUnder the terms of the First PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first seven months. The term of the First PPP Note is two years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the First PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the First PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a seven-month deferral period provided in the First PPP Note and through April 14, 2022.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for forgiveness for all or a part of the First PPP Loan. The amount of First PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including: (i) the amount of First PPP Loan proceeds that are used by the Company during the 24-week period after the First PPP Loan origination date for certain specified purposes including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 75% of the First PPP Loan amount is used for eligible payroll costs; (ii) our maintaining or rehiring employees, and maintaining salaries at certain levels; and (iii) other factors established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on First PPP Loan forgiveness, only that portion of the First PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty four -week period will qualify for forgiveness. As of August 6, 2021, the Company received notice from Arvest Bank and SBA that the full amount of the First PPP Loan in the amount of $168,800 has been forgiven. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe foregoing description of the First PPP Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the First PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.5 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan\nAdditionally, on June 15, 2020, we received $150,000 in loan funding from the SBA under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL\u201d) program administered by the SBA, which program was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. The EIDL is evidenced by a promissory note, dated June 11, 2020 (the EIDL Note\u201d) in the original principal amount of $150,000 with the SBA, the lender.\nUnder the terms of the EIDL Note, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The term of the EIDL Note is 30 years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under the EIDL Note. Under the EIDL Note, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning on July 11, 2021 through the maturity date of June 11, 2050. The EIDL Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty.\nThe EIDL Note provides for certain customary events of default, including: (i) a failure to comply with any provision of the EIDL Note, the related Loan Authorization and Agreement, or other EIDL loan documents; (ii) a default on any other SBA loan; (iii) a sale or transfer of, or failure to preserve or account to SBA's satisfaction for, any of the collateral or its proceeds; (iv) a failure of us or anyone acting on its behalf to disclose any material fact to SBA; (v) the making of a materially false or misleading representation to SBA by us or anyone acting on our behalf; (vi) a default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if SBA believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note; (vii) a failure to pay any taxes when due; (viii) if we become the subject of a proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law; (ix) if a receiver or liquidator is appointed for any part of our business or property; (x) the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (xi) has any adverse change in financial condition or business operation that SBA believes may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note; (xii) effects any reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other transaction changing ownership or business structure without SBA's prior written consent; or (xiii) becomes the subject of a civil or criminal action that SBA believes may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note. The foregoing description of the EIDL Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EIDL Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current of future effect on our financial condition.\nCash Flow\nThe following table provides detailed information about our net cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(508.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(372.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash and cash equivalent at end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $508,162. Net loss adjusted for non-cash items (impairment of intangible assets, depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation expense) used cash of $711,385. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $203,223. The most significant drivers were decreases in accounts receivable (due to timing of collections) and other receivables, inventory, and prepaid and other current assets. These decreases, which provided net cash, were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable, which used net cash.\nThis compares to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $372,139. Net loss adjusted for non-cash items (impairment of intangible assets, depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation expense) used cash of $282,518. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $89,621. The most significant drivers were decreases in accounts receivable (due to timing of collections) and other receivables which were partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable.\nNet cash provided by/used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9,758 due to equipment maintenance. This compares to $0 of cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $693,181 compared to $312,469 in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. In each of 2020 and 2019 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to debt financing proceeds from affiliates, net of repayments. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our financing activities.\nWe believe it will be necessary to obtain additional liquidity resources in order to support our operations. We are addressing our liquidity needs by seeking to generate positive cash flows from operations and developing additional backup capital sources.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nWhile there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements, areas that are particularly significant include:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Cash and cash equivalents; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Property, plant, and equipment; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Other property and equipment; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Fair value; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Concentration of Credit Risk, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Inventory </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Goodwill and other intangible assets </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenue recognition </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Business combinations </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Share-based compensation, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Income taxes and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Earnings per share </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, please refer to Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nWe consider all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents. We had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When property, plant and equipment is disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any gain or loss is included in Other income/(expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, as follows:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>Asset category </td> <td> </td> <td>Useful Life </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Welding equipment, Trucks, Machinery and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>5 - 7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computer hardware and software </td> <td> </td> <td>7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 4, Property, plant and equipment, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOther Property and Equipment:\nOur office equipment in Austin, Texas is being depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three to seven years.\nFair Value:\nFinancial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, established a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;\nLeve1 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Leve1 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\nLeve1 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity's own data).\nReceivables are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset, based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable forecasts of future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible.\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method. Elements of cost in inventories include:\nTable 115: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>raw materials, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>direct labor, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>manufacturing and indirect overhead. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; cost is generally determined by the weighted average cost method. Inventories deemed to have costs greater than their respective market values are reduced to net realizable value with a loss recorded in income in the period recognized.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of our financial instruments such as accounts receivable and payables approximated their fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of short-term notes and advances approximated their fair values because the underlying interest rates approximated market rates at the balance sheet dates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents placed with high credit quality institutions and accounts receivable due from Pro-Tech's customers. Management evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. If management becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations after a sale has occurred, we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectable from the customer. Accounts receivable are written off at the point they are considered uncollectible. Due to historically very low uncollectible balances and no specific indications of current uncollectibility, we have not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2020. If the financial conditions of Pro-Tech's customers were to deteriorate or if general economic conditions were to worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 4 customers comprised 73 % of our gross accounts receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 2 customers comprised 64 % of our total revenue.\nInventory\nOur inventory balances are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consists of products purchased by Pro-Tech for use in the process of providing hardbanding services. No impairment losses on inventory were recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization and, if applicable, impairment charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nWe perform an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We have determined that the Company is comprised of one reporting unit at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the goodwill balances of $145,149 at December of each year are included in the single reporting unit. To date, an impairment of goodwill has not been recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we bypassed the qualitative assessment, and proceeded directly to the quantitative test for goodwill impairment.\nOur Goodwill balance consists of the amount recognized in connection with the acquisition of Pro-Tech. Our other intangible assets are comprised of contract-based and marketing-related intangible assets, as well as acquisition-related intangibles. Acquisition-related intangibles include the value of Pro-Tech's trademark and customer relationships, both of which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of 10 years beginning August 2018.\nOur contract-based intangible assets include an agreement to sublicense certain patents belonging to AVV (the AVV Sublicense\u201d), a license (the Trademark License\u201d) to the trademark of Liquidmetal Coatings Enterprises LLC ( Liquidmetal\u201d), and several non-compete agreements made in connection with the acquisition of the AVV Sublicense and the Trademark License (the Non-Compete Agreements\u201d). The contract-based intangible assets have useful lives of approximately 11 years for the AVV Sublicense and 15 years for the Trademark License. With the initiation of a multi-year strategy plan involving synergies between the acquisition of Pro-Tech and our existing intellectual property, we have begun to use the economic benefits of its intangible assets, and therefore began amortization of its intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the useful lives indicated above beginning July 31, 2018, the effective date of the Pro-Tech acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment of the AVV Sublicense, the Trademark License and the Non-Compete Agreements totaling $2,616,705. Effective September 1, 2020, we and AVV have mutually agreed to terminate the AVV Sublicense Agreement and Trademark License. Since the date of the Transaction Agreement, we have not realized any revenue from products or services related to the AVV Sublicense Agreement or Trademark License. Also effective September 1, 2020, we and LMCE have agreed to terminate the supply and services agreement dated September 6, 2019 although we continue to purchase and utilize the products of LMCE. We are evaluating our business strategy in light of the current conditions of the national and global oil and gas markets.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue as it satisfies contractual performance obligations by transferring promised goods or services to the customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services. A good or service is transferred to a customer when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service.\nWe have one revenue stream, which relates to the provision of hardbanding services by its subsidiary Pro-Tech. All performance obligations of our contracts with customers are satisfied over the duration of the contract as customer-owned equipment is serviced and then made available for immediate use as completed during the service period. We have reviewed our contracts with Pro-Tech customers and determined that due to their short-term nature, with durations of several days of service at the customer's location, it is only those contracts that occur near the end of a financial reporting period that will potentially require allocation to ensure revenue is recognized in the proper period. We have reviewed all such transactions and recorded revenue accordingly.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our revenue was recognized from contracts with oilfield operators, and we did not recognize impairment losses on any receivables or contract assets.\nBecause our contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, we have elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations.\nBusiness combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nShare-Based Compensation\nFrom time to time we may issue stock options, warrants and restricted stock as compensation to employees, directors, officers and affiliates, as well as to acquire goods or services from third parties. In all cases, we calculate share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expenses awards based on fair value at the grant date on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which in the case of third party suppliers is the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period, and for employees, directors, officers and affiliates is typically the vesting period. Share-based compensation is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9, Warrants, and Note 10, Stock Options to the consolidated financial statements, for further information.\nIncome Taxes:\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nEarnings per Share:\nBasic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 28,037,713 at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilutive effects of common stock equivalents such as options, warrants and convertible securities.\nThe following table outlines outstanding common stock shares and common stock equivalents.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common Stock Shares Outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,037,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,037,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,706,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,783,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock Options </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,918,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,994,812 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nOn October 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 require goodwill impairment to be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit and require the loss recognized to not exceed that total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 has been applied on a prospective basis, effective for our annual goodwill impairment test beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), which expands the scope of ASC 718 to include all share-based payments arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both employees and nonemployees. Under this ASU, an entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor's own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity's adoption date of Topic 606. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which, together with amendments comprising ASC 842, requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases and generally recognized, for operating and finance leases with terms exceeding twelve months, a right-of-use asset (or ROU\u201d) and lease liability on the balance sheet. In addition to this main provision, this standard included a number of additional changes to lease accounting. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either the adoption date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We used the adoption date as our date of initial application. As a result, historical financial information was not updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard are not provided as of and for periods before January 1, 2019.\nThe new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting. We elected the short term lease recognition exemption and we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for qualifying leases (leases with a term of less than 12 months from lease commencement). We also elected the accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes.\nWe have determined that adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because it does not currently have any arrangements that must be accounted for as leases.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on our financial statements.", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive analysis of Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc.'s financial condition and operational results. It discusses key sections such as Forward-Looking Statements, Business Overview, Recent Developments, Financial Results, and Liquidity & Capital Resources. The company faced a significant revenue decrease, cost reduction, and impairment losses from the year ended December 31, 2019, to the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the report notes that the company experienced financial constraints, leading to delayed filings and uncertainties about its ability to continue as a going concern. These uncertainties are a result of net losses, negative cash flow, and working capital deficits.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. MD&A is presented in the following seven sections:\n \u25cf Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements; \n \u25cf Business Overview; \n \u25cf Results of Operations; \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; \n \u25cf Recently Adopted Accounting Standards; and \n \u25cf Recently Issued Accounting Standards. \nMD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and our audited consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes thereto.\nIn MD&A, we use we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Victory\u201d and the Company\u201d to refer to Victory Oilfield Tech. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context requires otherwise. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. We caution readers that important facts and factors described in MD&A and elsewhere in this document sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect our actual results, and could cause our actual results during 2021 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us.\nAs reported in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements, we have suffered recurring losses from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nMany statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In particular, the words anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d suggests,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d estimates,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d forecast,\u201d variations of such words, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:\n \u25cf continued operating losses; \n \u25cf adverse developments in economic conditions and, particularly, in conditions in the oil and gas industries; \n \u25cf volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets; \n \u25cf our inability to successfully execute on our growth strategy; \n \u25cf the competitive nature of our industry; \n \u25cf credit risk exposure from our customers; \n \u25cf price increases or business interruptions in our supply of raw materials; \n \u25cf failure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles; \n \u25cf business disruptions, security threats and security breaches, including security risks to our information technology systems; \n \u25cf terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; \n \u25cf failure to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes; \n \u25cf risks associated with protecting data privacy; \n \u25cf significant environmental liabilities and costs as a result of our current and past operations or products, including operations or products related to our licensed coating materials; \n \u25cf transporting certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature; \n \u25cf litigation and other commitments and contingencies; \n \u25cf ability to recruit and retain the experienced and skilled personnel we need to compete; \n \u25cf work stoppages, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force; \n \u25cf delays in obtaining permits by our future customers or acquisition targets for their operations; \n \u25cf our ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; \n \u25cf intellectual property infringement suits against us by third parties; \n \u25cf our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u25cf risk that the insurance we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures; \n \u25cf risks associated with changes in tax rates or regulations, including unexpected impacts of the new U.S. TCJA legislation, which may differ with further regulatory guidance and changes in our current interpretations and assumptions; \n \u25cf our substantial indebtedness; \n \u25cf the results of pending litigation; \n \u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited; \n \u25cf any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; \n \u25cf other factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and \n \u25cf other factors beyond our control. \nThese cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. Potential investors should not make an investment decision based solely on our projections, estimates or expectations.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are an Austin, Texas based publicly held oilfield energy technology products company focused on improving well performance and extending the lifespan of the industry's most sophisticated and expensive equipment. America's resurgence in oil and gas production is largely driven by new innovative technologies and processes as most dramatically and recently demonstrated by fracking. One such process is hardbanding, in which a wear-resistant alloy is applied to the tool joints of drillpipe or drill collars to prolong the life of oilfield tubulars. We utilize wear-resistant alloys which are mechanically stronger, harder and more corrosion resistant than typical alloys found in the market today. This combination of characteristics creates opportunities for drillers to dramatically improve lateral drilling lengths, well completion time and total well costs.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe plan to continue our U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already recognized as a high-quality services provider to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, we expect that each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our existing products and services. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.\nWe believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the Company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy.\nRecent Developments\nImpact of Coronavirus Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Most states and cities have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, stay-at-home\u201d rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.\nAlthough stay at home orders and lock downs on businesses in the areas where we operate have caused our staff to conduct business operations from their homes, this change has not resulted in a significant impact to our ability to operate. However, the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the world has driven sharp demand destruction for crude oil as whole economies ordered curtailed activity. As a result, companies across the industry have responded with severe capital spending budget cuts, personnel layoffs, facility closures and bankruptcy filings. We expect industry activity levels and spending by customers to remain depressed throughout the remainder of 2021 as destruction of demand for oil and gas continues.\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our operators, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent of the pandemic's continued effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the pace at which jurisdictions across the country re-open and restrictions begin to lift, the availability of government financial support to our business and our customers, and whether a resurgence of the outbreak occurs. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, but it could be material.\nVPEG Note\nDuring the period of January 1, 2021 through August 20, 2021 we received additional loan proceeds of $278,100 from VPEG pursuant to the New VPEG Note (See Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the New VPEG Note).\nOn January 31, 2021 we and VPEG entered into an amendment to the New Debt Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d pursuant to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $3,500,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nOn September 3, 2021 we and VPEG entered into Amendment No. 3 to the New Debt Agreement to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $4,000,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nPPP Note\nAs of August 6, 2021 we have received notice from Arvest Bank and the SBA that the full amount of the first PPP Note for $168,800 has been forgiven. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The amount forgiven will be recorded as income in our financial statements as of the date of forgiveness.\nOn February 1, 2021, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $98,622 pursuant to a second draw loan under the PPP. The unsecured loan (the Second PPP Loan\u201d) is evidenced by a promissory note (the Second PPP Note\u201d) issued by us, dated January 28, 2021, in the principal amount of $98,622 with Arvest Bank.\nUnder the terms of the Second PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first 10 months. The term of the Second PPP Note is five years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Second PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the Second PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a 10-month deferral period provided in the Second PPP Note and through January 28, 2026.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for forgiveness for all or a part of the Second PPP Loan. The amount of Second PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on Second PPP Loan forgiveness, only that portion of the Second PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty-four -week period will qualify for forgiveness. Although we have used the entire amount of the Second PPP Loan for qualifying expenses, no assurance is provided that we will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan in whole or in part.\nThe Second PPP Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Second PPP Note provide for certain customary events of default, including our: (i) failure to make a payment when due; (ii) breach of the note terms; (iii) default on any other loan with the Lender; (iv) filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against us; (v) reorganization merger, consolidation or other change in ownership or business structure without the Lender's prior written consent; (vi) adverse change in financial condition or business operation that the Lender believes may affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note; and (vii) default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if the Lender believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender has customary remedies and may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owed under the Second PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from us and file suit and obtain judgment against us.\nThe foregoing description of the Second PPP Note does not purport to be complete is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.\nFilings with the SEC\nOn September 16, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) adopted extensive amendments to Rule 15c2-11 ( Rule\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act\u201d). The Rule governs the publication of quotations for securities in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, including the OTC Pink Market where our common stock is quoted. Rule 15c2-11 makes it unlawful for a broker-dealer to initiate a quotation for a security unless the broker dealer has in its records prescribed information about the issuer that is current and publicly available. The lack of full time accounting personnel and financial constraints resulting in delayed payments to our external professional services providers have restricted our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. For these reasons, we were unable to timely file our quarterly and annual reports during 2019 and 2020 and our quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of 2021. We continue to actively seek additional sources of capital which we believe will allow the resumption of timely current public reporting practices no later than the third quarter of 2021.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nTotal revenue\nWe generate revenue from hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars and grinding services.\nOur revenues are generally impacted by the following factors:\n \u25cf our ability to successfully develop and launch new solutions and services \n \u25cf changes in buying habits of our customers \n \u25cf changes in the level of competition faced by our products \n \u25cf domestic drilling activity and spending by the oil and natural gas industry in the United States \nTotal cost of revenue\nThe costs associated with generating our revenue fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes, average selling prices, product mix, and changes in the price of raw materials and consist primarily of the following:\n \u25cf hardbanding production materials purchases \n \u25cf hardbanding supplies \n \u25cf labor \n \u25cf depreciation expense for hardbanding equipment \n \u25cf field expenses \nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nOur selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as administrative overhead costs, including:\n \u25cf compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, which includes share-based compensation expense \n \u25cf rent expense, communications expense, and maintenance and repair costs \n \u25cf legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees and insurance expenses. \nThese expenses are not expected to materially increase or decrease directly with changes in total revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation of hardbanding equipment which is reported in Total cost of revenue\nInterest expense\nInterest expense, net consists primary of interest expense and loan fees on borrowings as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our indebtedness.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, from various non-operating items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, interest income, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, as well as non-operational gains and losses unrelated to our core business.\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\nWe are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, our operating results, the availability of any net operating loss carryforwards, any future business combinations, and changes to tax laws and regulations are key factors that will determine our future book and taxable income.\nIncome from discontinued operations\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues, related expenses and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations summarized and analyzed below may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\n\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased by 61%, from $2,204,104 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $851,393 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in hardbanding revenue generated by Pro-Tech as a result of as a result of less drilling due to the low price of a barrel of oil and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for oil and gas.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by 47%, from $1,015,855 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $537,427 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to decreases in materials, direct labor, other direct costs resulting from decreases in Pro-Tech's revenue generating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and to a lesser extent, other reductions in expenses such as depreciation on equipment.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 32%, from $1,705,704 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,165,009 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following:\n \u25cf Consulting fees were reduced by eliminating the number of consultants and moving others to payroll \n \u25cf Payroll related expenses were reduced due to employee downsizing \n \u25cf Premiums for Directors and Officers liability insurance were reduced \nThese decreases were partially offset by increases in accounting fees.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by 93%, from $265,318 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $19,609 during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the reduction of amortization of Intangible Assets, which were impaired at the end of 2019. In addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nImpairment loss\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairments to the AVV Sublicense, the Trademark License and the Non-Compete Agreements of $2,214,167, $1,182,500 and $67,500, respectively, which net of accumulated amortization of $847,462 represented 100% of the remaining value of each of these assets, for a total impairment loss of $2,616,705.\nIn addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by 56%, from $197,851 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87,677 in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the restructuring of our notes payable to VPEG as well as the Rogers Note, the Kodak Note, and the Matheson Note. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.\nTax benefit\nThere is no material provision for income tax expenses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to the net operating losses, ( NOL\u201d) in each of the respective years. The realization of future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income within the NOL carry forward period. Given our history of net operating losses, management has determined that it is more-likely-than-not we will not be able to realize the tax benefit of our NOL carry forwards. Current standards require that a valuation allowance thus be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Income from Discontinued Operations, and Loss Applicable to Common Stockholders\nWe reported an operating loss for 2020 of $(953,858) compared to an operating loss of $(3,530,835) for 2019.\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues and related expenses resulting from the trailing activity of Aurora and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs a result of the foregoing, loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(953,858), or $(0.03) per share, compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of $(3,530,835), or $(0.13) per share, for 2019 on weighted average shares of 28,037,713 in each of the respective periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGoing Concern\nHistorically we have experienced, and we continue to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities, and working capital deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. MD&A is presented in the following seven sections:\n \u25cf Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements; \n \u25cf Business Overview; \n \u25cf Results of Operations; \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; \n \u25cf Recently Adopted Accounting Standards; and \n \u25cf Recently Issued Accounting Standards. \nMD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and our audited consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes thereto.\nIn MD&A, we use we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Victory\u201d and the Company\u201d to refer to Victory Oilfield Tech. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context requires otherwise. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. We caution readers that important facts and factors described in MD&A and elsewhere in this document sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect our actual results, and could cause our actual results during 2021 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us.\nAs reported in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements, we have suffered recurring losses from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nMany statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In particular, the words anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d suggests,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d estimates,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d forecast,\u201d variations of such words, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:\n \u25cf continued operating losses; \n \u25cf adverse developments in economic conditions and, particularly, in conditions in the oil and gas industries; \n \u25cf volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets; \n \u25cf our inability to successfully execute on our growth strategy; \n \u25cf the competitive nature of our industry; \n \u25cf credit risk exposure from our customers; \n \u25cf price increases or business interruptions in our supply of raw materials; \n \u25cf failure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles; \n \u25cf business disruptions, security threats and security breaches, including security risks to our information technology systems; \n \u25cf terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; \n \u25cf failure to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes; \n \u25cf risks associated with protecting data privacy; \n \u25cf significant environmental liabilities and costs as a result of our current and past operations or products, including operations or products related to our licensed coating materials; \n \u25cf transporting certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature; \n \u25cf litigation and other commitments and contingencies; \n \u25cf ability to recruit and retain the experienced and skilled personnel we need to compete; \n \u25cf work stoppages, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force; \n \u25cf delays in obtaining permits by our future customers or acquisition targets for their operations; \n \u25cf our ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; \n \u25cf intellectual property infringement suits against us by third parties; \n \u25cf our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u25cf risk that the insurance we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures; \n \u25cf risks associated with changes in tax rates or regulations, including unexpected impacts of the new U.S. TCJA legislation, which may differ with further regulatory guidance and changes in our current interpretations and assumptions; \n \u25cf our substantial indebtedness; \n \u25cf the results of pending litigation; \n \u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited; \n \u25cf any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; \n \u25cf other factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and \n \u25cf other factors beyond our control. \nThese cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. Potential investors should not make an investment decision based solely on our projections, estimates or expectations.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are an Austin, Texas based publicly held oilfield energy technology products company focused on improving well performance and extending the lifespan of the industry's most sophisticated and expensive equipment. America's resurgence in oil and gas production is largely driven by new innovative technologies and processes as most dramatically and recently demonstrated by fracking. One such process is hardbanding, in which a wear-resistant alloy is applied to the tool joints of drillpipe or drill collars to prolong the life of oilfield tubulars. We utilize wear-resistant alloys which are mechanically stronger, harder and more corrosion resistant than typical alloys found in the market today. This combination of characteristics creates opportunities for drillers to dramatically improve lateral drilling lengths, well completion time and total well costs.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe plan to continue our U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already recognized as a high-quality services provider to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, we expect that each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our existing products and services. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.\nWe believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the Company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy.\nRecent Developments\nImpact of Coronavirus Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The virus has since spread to over 150 countries and every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Most states and cities have reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, stay-at-home\u201d rules and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate, as well as guidance in response to the pandemic and the need to contain it.\nAlthough stay at home orders and lock downs on businesses in the areas where we operate have caused our staff to conduct business operations from their homes, this change has not resulted in a significant impact to our ability to operate. However, the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the world has driven sharp demand destruction for crude oil as whole economies ordered curtailed activity. As a result, companies across the industry have responded with severe capital spending budget cuts, personnel layoffs, facility closures and bankruptcy filings. We expect industry activity levels and spending by customers to remain depressed throughout the remainder of 2021 as destruction of demand for oil and gas continues.\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our operators, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent of the pandemic's continued effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the pace at which jurisdictions across the country re-open and restrictions begin to lift, the availability of government financial support to our business and our customers, and whether a resurgence of the outbreak occurs. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, but it could be material.\nVPEG Note\nDuring the period of January 1, 2021 through August 20, 2021 we received additional loan proceeds of $278,100 from VPEG pursuant to the New VPEG Note (See Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the New VPEG Note).\nOn January 31, 2021 we and VPEG entered into an amendment to the New Debt Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d pursuant to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $3,500,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nOn September 3, 2021 we and VPEG entered into Amendment No. 3 to the New Debt Agreement to which the parties agreed to increase the loan amount to up to $4,000,000 to cover future working capital needs.\nPPP Note\nAs of August 6, 2021 we have received notice from Arvest Bank and the SBA that the full amount of the first PPP Note for $168,800 has been forgiven. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The amount forgiven will be recorded as income in our financial statements as of the date of forgiveness.\nOn February 1, 2021, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $98,622 pursuant to a second draw loan under the PPP. The unsecured loan (the Second PPP Loan\u201d) is evidenced by a promissory note (the Second PPP Note\u201d) issued by us, dated January 28, 2021, in the principal amount of $98,622 with Arvest Bank.\nUnder the terms of the Second PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first 10 months. The term of the Second PPP Note is five years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Second PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the Second PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a 10-month deferral period provided in the Second PPP Note and through January 28, 2026.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for forgiveness for all or a part of the Second PPP Loan. The amount of Second PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on Second PPP Loan forgiveness, only that portion of the Second PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty-four -week period will qualify for forgiveness. Although we have used the entire amount of the Second PPP Loan for qualifying expenses, no assurance is provided that we will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan in whole or in part.\nThe Second PPP Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Second PPP Note provide for certain customary events of default, including our: (i) failure to make a payment when due; (ii) breach of the note terms; (iii) default on any other loan with the Lender; (iv) filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against us; (v) reorganization merger, consolidation or other change in ownership or business structure without the Lender's prior written consent; (vi) adverse change in financial condition or business operation that the Lender believes may affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note; and (vii) default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if the Lender believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender has customary remedies and may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owed under the Second PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from us and file suit and obtain judgment against us.\nThe foregoing description of the Second PPP Note does not purport to be complete is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.\nFilings with the SEC\nOn September 16, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) adopted extensive amendments to Rule 15c2-11 ( Rule\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act\u201d). The Rule governs the publication of quotations for securities in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, including the OTC Pink Market where our common stock is quoted. Rule 15c2-11 makes it unlawful for a broker-dealer to initiate a quotation for a security unless the broker dealer has in its records prescribed information about the issuer that is current and publicly available. The lack of full time accounting personnel and financial constraints resulting in delayed payments to our external professional services providers have restricted our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. For these reasons, we were unable to timely file our quarterly and annual reports during 2019 and 2020 and our quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of 2021. We continue to actively seek additional sources of capital which we believe will allow the resumption of timely current public reporting practices no later than the third quarter of 2021.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nTotal revenue\nWe generate revenue from hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars and grinding services.\nOur revenues are generally impacted by the following factors:\n \u25cf our ability to successfully develop and launch new solutions and services \n \u25cf changes in buying habits of our customers \n \u25cf changes in the level of competition faced by our products \n \u25cf domestic drilling activity and spending by the oil and natural gas industry in the United States \nTotal cost of revenue\nThe costs associated with generating our revenue fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes, average selling prices, product mix, and changes in the price of raw materials and consist primarily of the following:\n \u25cf hardbanding production materials purchases \n \u25cf hardbanding supplies \n \u25cf labor \n \u25cf depreciation expense for hardbanding equipment \n \u25cf field expenses \nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nOur selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as administrative overhead costs, including:\n \u25cf compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, which includes share-based compensation expense \n \u25cf rent expense, communications expense, and maintenance and repair costs \n \u25cf legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees and insurance expenses. \nThese expenses are not expected to materially increase or decrease directly with changes in total revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation of hardbanding equipment which is reported in Total cost of revenue\nInterest expense\nInterest expense, net consists primary of interest expense and loan fees on borrowings as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our indebtedness.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, from various non-operating items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, interest income, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, as well as non-operational gains and losses unrelated to our core business.\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\nWe are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, our operating results, the availability of any net operating loss carryforwards, any future business combinations, and changes to tax laws and regulations are key factors that will determine our future book and taxable income.\nIncome from discontinued operations\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues, related expenses and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations summarized and analyzed below may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years

by 61%, from $2,204,104 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $851,393 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in hardbanding revenue generated by Pro-Tech as a result of as a result of less drilling due to the low price of a barrel of oil and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for oil and gas.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by 47%, from $1,015,855 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $537,427 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to decreases in materials, direct labor, other direct costs resulting from decreases in Pro-Tech's revenue generating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and to a lesser extent, other reductions in expenses such as depreciation on equipment.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 32%, from $1,705,704 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,165,009 in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following:\n \u25cf Consulting fees were reduced by eliminating the number of consultants and moving others to payroll \n \u25cf Payroll related expenses were reduced due to employee downsizing \n \u25cf Premiums for Directors and Officers liability insurance were reduced \nThese decreases were partially offset by increases in accounting fees.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by 93%, from $265,318 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $19,609 during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the reduction of amortization of Intangible Assets, which were impaired at the end of 2019. In addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nImpairment loss\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairments to the AVV Sublicense, the Trademark License and the Non-Compete Agreements of $2,214,167, $1,182,500 and $67,500, respectively, which net of accumulated amortization of $847,462 represented 100% of the remaining value of each of these assets, for a total impairment loss of $2,616,705.\nIn addition, please refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased by 56%, from $197,851 during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87,677 in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the restructuring of our notes payable to VPEG as well as the Rogers Note, the Kodak Note, and the Matheson Note. See Note 7, Notes Payable, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.\nTax benefit\nThere is no material provision for income tax expenses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to the net operating losses, ( NOL\u201d) in each of the respective years. The realization of future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income within the NOL carry forward period. Given our history of net operating losses, management has determined that it is more-likely-than-not we will not be able to realize the tax benefit of our NOL carry forwards. Current standards require that a valuation allowance thus be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Income from Discontinued Operations, and Loss Applicable to Common Stockholders\nWe reported an operating loss for 2020 of $(953,858) compared to an operating loss of $(3,530,835) for 2019.\nIncome from discontinued operations consist of revenues and related expenses resulting from the trailing activity of Aurora and loss on disposal of Aurora. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAs a result of the foregoing, loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(953,858), or $(0.03) per share, compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of $(3,530,835), or $(0.13) per share, for 2019 on weighted average shares of 28,037,713 in each of the respective periods.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGoing Concern\nHistorically we have experienced, and we continue to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities, and working capital deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The"}
