MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (All dollar values in this section are in thousands.)\nThe following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. The detailed financial discussion that follows focuses on 2019 results compared to 2018. For a discussion of 2018 results compared to 2017 see the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results, including those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.\nThe Company's accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The critical accounting policies require judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. Management has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief summary of the more significant policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes a loan has become noncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDR) and classified as impaired.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nAll loans classified as substandard or worse are individually evaluated for potential designation as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nTDRs are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For TDRs that subsequently default, the Bank determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on a combination of the Bank's loss history and loss history from the Bank's peer group. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.\nOverview\nThe Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $14,822, compared to $34,521 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $28,099 for the year ended December 31, 2017. After earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, the Company's net earnings available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $14,806, $34,505, and $28,083, respectively. Net earnings available to shareholders decreased by $19,699 when comparing 2019 with 2018, primarily driven by specific reserves of $9,759 related to a Shared National Credit ( SNC\u201d) relationship, and $20,657 related to two lending relationships in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios discussed below, along with $4,301 related to post-employment and retirement expense recorded during 2019. Interest income increased $14,747 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 mainly due to an increased volume of loans and fluctuating rates during 2019.\nIn connection with our year-end audit process, and subsequent to our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019, we have determined the need to record an additional loan loss provision of $18,761 to provide specific reserves for two lending relationships, which were both on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2019 and comprised a material portion of our classified assets, in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios. Our determination to record this additional provision was primarily the result of certain developments and circumstances regarding the collectability of these two relationships that arose following our earnings release, and have been amplified by various macroeconomic developments. Under GAAP we are required to reflect the additional provision during the fourth quarter of 2019, and the specific reserves as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, this Form 10-K reflects the updated provision and reserves and, as a result, contains financial information that is different than the information previously presented in our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFurthermore at this time, we expect to experience certain ongoing lending and depository losses occurring during the first quarter of 2020 related to at least one of these relationships, which would be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of 2020. We continue to monitor these two relationships, and we could experience additional losses attributed to these relationships in future periods.\nPlanned Reduction of Non-Strategic Loan Portfolio\nAs previously announced, on January 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with FB Financial Corporation ( FB Financial\u201d), pursuant to which the Company will merge into FB Financial, with FB Financial continuing as the surviving corporation (the merger\u201d). In connection with the announcement of the merger, FB Financial identified a group of nonstrategic loans that would be liquidated in connection with the consummation of the merger. As disclosed in FB Financials' merger investor presentation, the nonstrategic loans were comprised of shared national credits, corporate and healthcare lending relationships totaling approximately $429,500 at December 31, 2019, including criticized and classified loans totaling approximately $39,100, of which the two lending relationships identified above were included.\nThe Company has been in communication with FB Financial regarding its determination to record the additional 2019 provision for loan losses and specific reserves described above. The specific reserves discussed above are consistent with the overall anticipated impact of the liquidation of the nonstrategic loans and FB Financials' aggregate estimated credit marks associated with the acquired loan portfolio as disclosed in their merger investor presentation. Additionally, as a result of subsequent loans sales, payoffs and other ordinary course changes, the nonstrategic loans totaled approximately $412,600 as of February 28, 2020, reflecting a decrease of approximately $16,900 from December 31, 2019, which represents a 23.5% annualized decrease. The Company expects to continue to experience loan payoffs, customer migration and other ordinary course changes in this portfolio during the coming periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the presentation of loans and other assets as held for sale when the criteria for such classification are met.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense. Net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $111,160, $105,503, and $97,046, respectively, which is an increase of $5,657, or 5.4%, comparing 2019 and 2018, and an increase of $8,457, or 8.7%, comparing 2018 and 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income increased $14,747 and $37,492 primarily due to an asset rotation away from lower-yielding securities combined with growth in the loan portfolio. These were partially offset by increases of $9,090 and $29,035 in interest expense, which totaled $73,532, $64,442, and $35,407, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increases in interest-bearing deposits combined with increases in interest rates for money market deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances during 2019 and 2018 which had an impact on the cost of funds for the Bank.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $3,867,484, $3,995,592, and $3,361,320 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which is a decrease of $128,108, or 3.2%, and an increase of $634,272, or 18.9%, respectively, primarily due to significant growth in loans.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, average loans held for investment increased 14.3% and 22.5%, respectively, and investment securities decreased 36.3% during 2019 and increased 9.9% during 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our earning asset yield increased by 51 basis points and 21 basis points from the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while the total funding rates increased by 40 basis points and 64 basis points compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in yields throughout all three periods presented is primarily caused by fluctuations in the rate environment, intense competition, and our continued balance sheet rotation strategy.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the yield on taxable securities were 2.69%, 2.39% and 2.27%, respectively. The increase in yield in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates and a reduction in lower-yielding securities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the yield on tax exempt securities were 3.82%, 4.53% and 5.24%, respectively. The decrease in yield in 2019 is primarily due to the strategically-planned balance sheet rotation focused on core loan growth.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $3,255,747, $3,465,110, and $2,891,943, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which is a decrease of $209,363 or 6.0%, during 2019 compared to an increase of $573,167, or 19.8%, during 2018. The decrease for 2019 was due primarily to reduction in time deposits. The increases for 2018 and 2017 were due to growth in interest checking, money market deposits, time deposits and FHLB advances during these two years.\nDuring 2019, total average interest-bearing deposits decreased by $182,180, which included a decrease in average interest checking of $64,760, an increase of average money market accounts of $316,616, and a decrease in average time deposits outstanding of $426,060. During 2018, total average interest-bearing deposits grew $511,126, which included increases in average interest checking of $205,366, average money market accounts of $141,863, and average time deposits outstanding of $171,574.\nWith the decrease in the average loan portfolio during 2019, the average FHLB advances decreased by $15,173. Average FHLB advances increased $81,578 in 2018 as the average loans grew. Subordinated notes and other borrowings increased by $177 and $178, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases in 2019 and 2018 were due to the amortization of borrowing costs.\nThe cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 40 basis points to 2.26% during 2019 and increased 64 basis points to 1.86% during 2018. The increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities for 2019 and 2018 was due to increases in rates on interest checking, money market accounts, time deposits, FHLB advances and Federal funds purchased.\nThe tables below summarize average balances, yields, cost of funds, and the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nAverage Balances(7)-Yields & Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

evaluation, should be adequate to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior loan charge-offs.\nThe provision for loan losses was $32,047, $2,254 and $4,313 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $29,793 increase in the provision during 2019 was driven by a combination of both loan growth and specific reserves of $9,759 related to a SNC relationship and $20,657 related to two commercial and industrial lending relationships. The decrease in the provision in 2018 was driven by a strong local economy and improvements to other qualitative factors specific to the Bank resulting in the ALLL reserve of 88 basis points in 2018.\nIn connection with our year-end audit process, and subsequent to our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined to record an additional provision of $18,761 to fund a specific reserve in respect of two lending relationships in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios. Our determination to record this additional provision was primarily the result of certain developments and circumstances regarding the collectability from these two relationships that arose following our earnings release. Under GAAP we are required to reflect the additional provision during the fourth quarter of 2019, and the specific reserve as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, this Form 10-K contains financial information that reflects the updated provision and reserve that is different than the information previously presented in our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $17,775, $10,662 and $14,721, respectively. The following is a summary of the components of non-interest income (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-2018\nPercent\nIncrease </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2018-2017\nPercent\nIncrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service charges and fees </td> <td>3,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Banking revenue </td> <td>9,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth management </td> <td>2,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales and calls of securities </td> <td>2,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(564.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) gain on sale of loans held for investment </td> <td>(2,003) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain (loss) on foreclosed assets </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,400.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService charges on deposit accounts increased 46.1% in 2019 and 40.9% in 2018. The increase was mainly due to an increase in business analysis fees of $88 and $55 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other service charges and fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 17.0% when compared to 2018. The increase was due to an increase of $126 in ATM (Automated Teller Machine) fees, $98 in application fees, $88 in tax service fees, and $80 in unused commitment fees. Other service charges and fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 4.7% when compared to 2017. The increase for 2018 was mainly due to an increase of $118 in ATM fees.\nMortgage banking revenue consists primarily of net gains on mortgage loans sold, and mortgage servicing rights amortization. Gains on mortgage loans sold were $9,217 and $6,286, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The year-over-year increase in 2019 was attributable to an increase in production when compared to 2018. Mortgage servicing amortization was $1,289 and $867, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in amortization was a result of the decrease in rates causing higher prepayments leading to mortgage servicing rights being amortized over a shorter period when compared to 2018.\nWealth management income experienced a slight decrease of 3.0% for 2019 relative to 2018, mainly due to a decrease in overall commission's income. Wealth management income for 2018 was $2,969, an increase of 13.6% when compared with\n2017. The increase in wealth management income for 2018 is attributable to the growth in AUM and the growth in the investment markets during 2018. AUM was approximately $460, $374, and $359 million as of year-end 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nGains (losses) on sales and calls of securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $2,043, an increase of $6,203, when compared with the same period in 2018. The increase was due to the Company's election to sell certain securities to take advantage of the market conditions that existed during 2019, consistent with the strategic securities reduction. The Company evaluated its securities held-to-maturity and determined that certain securities no longer adhered to the Company's strategic focus and could be sold or reinvested to potentially improve the Company's liquidity position, duration profile and net interest margin. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity and, as a result, the Company transferred all of its securities held-to-maturity to securities available-for-sale. Once the securities were transferred to available-for-sale, certain securities were sold as part of the Company's balance sheet management initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss on sales and calls of securities was $4,160, a compared to a gain of $896 the year ended December 31, 2017. The large loss on sale in 2018 can be attributed to a balance sheet rotation strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2018 to ultimately re-purpose approximately $300,000 from lower-yielding securities into higher-yielding assets.\nNet loss on sale of loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2,003, a decrease of $2,003, or 100%, when compared to year ended December 31, 2018. The losses during the year ended December 31, 2019 were attributed to the sales of several SNC relationships during the year compared to no sales occurring during 2018. Net gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0, a decrease of $226, or 100%, from the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther non-interest income decreased $13, or 0.8%, when comparing the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and it increased $758, or 83.5%, when comparing the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in other non-interest income from 2019 is primarily attributable to a decrease in ceded premiums of $328. The increase in other non-interest income for 2018 is primarily attributable to increases in the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance (BOLI).\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $81,879, $73,478 and $60,824, respectively.

The expense increases for December 31, 2019, and 2018, were mainly due to general salary increases and certain post-employment and retirement benefits of $4.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment expense during 2019 and 2018 is attributable to the Company entering into various leases for new branch and office locations. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased in 2019 by 12.4% and in 2018 by 26.1%. Building rent expense increased $376 and $1,073 and software maintenance fees increased $737 and $658 in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe FDIC deposit insurance fund assessment decreased in 2019 by $1,605, or 46.5%, mainly due to a credit of approximately $900 that was received from the FDIC for a Small Bank Assessment Credit issued in 2019. The FDIC assessment expense also decreased due to the Company's decline in average assets, improved Leverage Ratio and other financial ratios considered in the FDIC's calculation for insurance assessments. The FDIC deposit insurance fund assessment\ndecreased 6.3% in 2018 due to improvements in demographics of loan portfolio and improvements in the Bank's risk profile in regulatory standing.\nMarketing expenses increased by 8.9% in 2019, and by 13.2% in 2018 due to efforts to gain a larger market share in Davidson County and the opening of two new branches during 2018.\nProfessional fee expenses remained steady during 2019 with a decrease of 1.3%. Professional fees increased by 29.1% during 2018 primarily due to increases in other professional fees $326, audit and accounting fees $125, merger expenses $334, and legal fees $213. A significant portion of the increase is related to expenses related to the acquisition of Civic.\nOther noninterest expense increased $1,657, or 19.6%, during 2019 and $648, or 8.3%, during 2018. The increase in 2019 can be attributed to ATM network expense $206; CDARS fee expense $367; captive insurance expense $134; and correspondent bank charges $130. The increase in 2018 was due to captive insurance expense $369; loan servicing expense $295; and board of director fees $108. Amortization of core deposit intangibles decreased $108 or 17.6%, during 2019 and increased $139, or 29.4%, during 2018.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following schedule details selected key ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on assets (Net income divided by average total assets)\n</td> <td>0.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on equity (Net income divided by average equity)\n</td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend payout ratio (Dividends declared per share divided by net income per share)\n</td> <td>17.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity to asset ratio (Average equity divided by average total assets)\n</td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage capital ratio (Equity divided by fourth quarter average total assets, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income)\n</td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe minimum leverage capital ratio required by the regulatory agencies is 4.00%.\nUnder guidelines developed by regulatory agencies a risk weight\u201d is assigned to various categories of assets and commitments ranging from 0% to 300% based on the risk associated with the asset.

Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon their maturity. Consequently, management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (ALLL)\nThe Company maintains the ALLL at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb the probable incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and is decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs. The ALLL is evaluated quarterly, although management is engaged in monitoring the adequacy of the allowance on a more frequent basis. In estimating the ALLL balance, the following factors are considered:\n\u2022past loan experience;\n\u2022the nature and volume of the portfolio;\n\u2022risks known about specific borrowers;\n\u2022underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans;\n\u2022current and anticipated economic conditions; and\n\u2022other factors which may affect the allowance for probable incurred losses.\nThe ALLL consists of two primary components: (1) a specific component that relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired, and (2) a general component which covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on a combination of the Bank's loss history and loss history from a peer group. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment.\nThe following loan portfolio segments have been identified: (1) Construction and land development loans, (2) Commercial real estate loans, (3) Residential real estate, (4) Commercial and industrial loans, and (5) Consumer and other loans. Management evaluates the risks associated with these segments based upon specific characteristics associated with the loan segments. These risk characteristics include, but are not limited to, the value of the underlying collateral, adverse economic conditions, and the borrower's cash flow. While the total ALLL consists of a specific portion and a general portion, both portions of the allowance are available to provide for probable incurred loan losses in the entire portfolio.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Loan\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>ALLL\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>ALLL\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>ALLL\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non impaired loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,730,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,575,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired loans (1)\n</td> <td>58,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>91,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,599) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired loans </td> <td>27,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,661 </td> <td> bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,816,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,674,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> bps </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Loans acquired pursuant to the acquisitions of MidSouth and Civic. These are performing loans recorded at estimated fair value at the respective acquisition dates. This fair value discount that was established at acquisition is accreted into interest income over the remaining lives of the related loans on a straight-line basis. The remaining fair value discount balance at December 31, 2019 related to the acquired loans was $726, or 1.2% of the outstanding aggregate loan balances. At December 31, 2019, loans identified as impaired beyond the extent of its recorded discount lead to an allowance for loan losses of $77 being recorded related to the acquired loans. The remaining fair value discount balance at December 31, 2018 related to the acquired loans was $1,210, or 1.3% of the outstanding aggregate loan balances. At December 31, 2018, loans identified as impaired beyond the extent of its recorded discount lead to an allowance for loan loss of $185 being recorded related to the acquired loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, the ALLL was $45,436, compared to $23,451 at December 31, 2018. ALLL as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.61% and 0.88% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Loan growth and deterioration of certain commercial loan relationships during the period is the primary reason for the increase in the ALLL.\nThe table below sets forth the activity in the ALLL for

The Company has relied heavily on the loss history of peer groups due to the lack of its own history of losses; therefore, reserve factors have been adjusted in accordance with the loss performance experienced by a select group of local peer banks. Allocations between categories of loans have also been affected by the change in the mix of loans among the categories.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the largest component of the ALLL was associated with commercial and industrial loans, followed by commercial real estate loans. The increase on these reserves as a percentage of the total allowance in these categories was primarily due to qualitative and specific risk factors in these portfolio segments, and specific reserves for impaired loans in the commercial and industrial segment. Commercial and industrial loans decreased 2.4% from $596,793, or 22.2% of total loans at the end of 2018, to $582,641, or 20.7% of total loans at year-end 2019. During 2019, construction and land development loans increased from $584,440 at December 31, 2018 to $591,541 at December 31, 2019, an increase of 1.2%. During the same period, commercial real estate loans increased 23.4%, from $805,260 at December 31, 2018 to $993,912 at December 31, 2019.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming loans consist of non-accrual loans and loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus OREO (i.e., real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure). Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days and management believes the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis, or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe primary component of nonperforming loans is nonaccrual loans, which as of December 31, 2019 totaled $27,035. The other component of nonperforming loans are loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing interest which totaled $654 at December 31, 2019. Loans past due greater than 90 days are placed on nonaccrual status unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection.\nIn connection with our year-end audit process, and subsequent to our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to fourth quarter of 2019, we determined to record an additional provision of $18,761 to fund a specific reserve in respect of two lending relationships in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios. Our determination to record this additional provision was primarily the result of certain developments and circumstances regarding the collectability from these two relationships that arose following our earnings release. Under GAAP we are required to reflect the additional provision during the fourth quarter of 2019, and the specific reserve as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, this Form 10-K contains financial information that reflects the updated provision and reserve that is different than the information previously presented in our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe table below summarizes nonperforming loans and assets for the periods presented.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans and assets </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Past due loans 90 days or more and still accruing interest </td> <td>654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans </td> <td>27,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreclosed real estate ( OREO\u201d) and repossessed assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans </td> <td>0.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>164 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>412 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>698 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>268 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>353 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were twenty loans on nonaccrual status.

Loan modifications are considered a TDR when the concession provided is not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources; however, not all loan modifications are TDRs. Our standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements, cash flow analysis, and collateral valuations; however, each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrower's specific circumstances at a point in time. TDRs can be either accruing or non-accruing loans. The Bank had one TDR for $311 at December 31, 2019, and one TDR for $167 as of December 31, 2018.\nGenerally, loans that are current as to principal and interest are not included in our nonperforming assets categories; however, a loan that is current may be classified as a potential problem loan if it exhibits potential weaknesses and management has information about possible credit problems of the borrower that has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be consistent with the Bank's loan policy established for loans classified as special mention or worse and less than 90 days past due, but not considered nonperforming. Loans are assigned risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually when classifying the loans as to credit risk.\nThe following definitions are used for assigning risk ratings to loans:\nSpecial Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans not meeting the criteria above are considered to be Pass\u201d rated loans. All loans in all loan categories are assigned risk ratings. As of December 31, 2019, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Dollars in Thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pass </td> <td> </td> <td>Special\nMention </td> <td> </td> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591,541 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td>991,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>993,912 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>637,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>643,601 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate </td> <td>2,219,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,229,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td>539,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582,641 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other </td> <td>4,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,764,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,816,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, the Bank realized a $12,291 decrease in classified and criticized loans compared to December 31, 2018.\nGain (loss) on Sale of Bonds\nGains (losses) on sales and calls of securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $2,043, an increase of $6,203, when compared with the same period in 2018. The loss from sales in 2018 is attributed to a balance sheet rotation strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2018 to re-purpose funds from lower yielding securities into higher yielding assets by selling those securities.\nThe AFS portfolio totaled $652,132 at December 31, 2019, compared to $1,030,668 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $378,536, or 36.7%. The decrease is due to the Company's continuation of the balance sheet rotation strategy during 2019 to unlock the value of the core bank.\nThe HTM portfolio totaled $0 at December 31, 2019, compared to $121,617 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $121,617, or 100%. The decrease can be attributed to the aforementioned balance sheet rotation strategy that included transferring securities from the HTM intention to the AFS intention during 2019.\nThe AFS securities represented 16.7% of total assets at December 31, 2019, and the combined AFS and HTM portfolios represented 27.1% of total assets at December 31, 2018. No securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,888 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: residential </td> <td>375,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>580,699 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: commercial </td> <td>17,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Notes </td> <td>33,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and political subdivisions </td> <td>225,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,799 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>652,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,030,668 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost of the HTM securities portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage backed securities: residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and political subdivisions </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents the maturities and yield characteristics of the AFS securities as of December 31, 2019.

The FHLB and Federal Reserve investments are restricted\u201d in that they can only be sold back to the respective institutions or another member institution at par, and are thus, not liquid, have no ready market or quoted market value, and are carried at cost.\nBank Premises and Equipment\nBank premises and equipment totaled $12,141 at December 31, 2019 compared to $12,371 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $230, or 1.9%.\nBOLI\nAs of December 31, 2019, the cash surrender value of the BOLI portfolio totaled $56,726, compared to $55,239 at December 31, 2018. The increase is attributed to the increase in cash surrender value during 2019.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $18,176 in goodwill related to the acquisition of MidSouth Bank in 2014 and Civic Bank & Trust in April of 2018. At December 31, 2019, there were no circumstances or significant changes that have occurred related to those acquisitions that, in management's assessment, would necessitate recording impairment of goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had net core deposit intangible of $448 and $952, respectively. At the time of the acquisitions, the Bank recorded a core deposit intangible of $3,059 and $558 related to MidSouth and Civic, respectively. These core deposit intangibles are amortizing over 8.2 and 3.2 years, respectively. Through December 31, 2019, the Company has recognized amortization of $3,169 related to the core deposit intangible.\nThe following table represents acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td>Accumulated\nAmortization </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td>Accumulated\nAmortization </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired intangible assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit intangibles </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,169) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,665) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAggregate amortization expense was $504, $612 and $473 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table presents the estimated remaining amortization expense:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $3,207,584, a decrease of $224,223, or 6.5%, compared to $3,431,807 at December 31, 2018. Included in the Company's funding strategy are brokered deposits and public funds deposits. Total brokered deposits decreased by 20.8%, to $632,241, at December 31, 2019 when compared with $797,795 at December 31, 2018. Public funds deposits decreased 50.6% from $782,890 at December 31, 2018 to $386,902 at December 31, 2019, because many of those deposits were placed in a reciprocal deposits program, providing FDIC insurance coverage to the public entities without having to pledge securities.\nTime deposits, excluding brokered deposits, as of December 31, 2019, amounted to $399,258, as compared to $532,445 as of December 31, 2018.\nThe average amounts for deposits for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are detailed in the following schedule.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands, except percentages </td> <td>Average\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest-bearing deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>297,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing checking accounts </td> <td>765,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>829,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market deposit accounts </td> <td>1,085,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>769,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>627,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings </td> <td>39,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits </td> <td>974,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,181,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,343,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,787,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows time deposits, excluding brokered deposits, of $100 or more by category based on time remaining until maturity.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three months through six months </td> <td>61,326 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six months through 12 months </td> <td>83,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over one year through three years </td> <td>128,630 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three years through five years </td> <td>15,933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over five years </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity, Other Borrowings, and Capital Resources\nFederal Funds Purchased and Repurchase Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no Federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and no securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nFHLB Advances\nThe Bank has established a line of credit with the FHLB of Cincinnati which is secured by a blanket pledge of 1-4 family residential mortgages, home equity lines of credit, multifamily real estate, and commercial real estate. At December 31, 2019, advances totaled $155,000 compared to $368,500 as of December 31, 2018.

In March 2016, $40,000 of 6.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes were issued in a public offering to accredited institutional investors, and in June 2016, $20,000 of 7.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes were issued to certain accredited institutional investors in a private offering. At December 31, 2019, subordinated notes, net of issuance costs, totaled $58,872 as compared to $58,693 at December 31, 2018. For regulatory capital purposes, the subordinated notes are treated as Tier 2 capital, subject to certain limitations, and are included in total regulatory capital when calculating the Company's total capital to risk weighted assets ratio as indicated in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe subordinated notes are unsecured and will rank at least equally with all of the Company's other unsecured subordinated indebtedness and will be effectively subordinated to all of our secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. The subordinated notes will be subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness, and will rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries including, in the case of the Company's bank subsidiary, its depositors, and any preferred equity holders of our subsidiaries. The holders of the subordinated notes may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.\nThe following table summarizes the terms of each subordinated note offering:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>March 2016\nSubordinated\nNotes </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2016\nSubordinated\nNotes </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal amount issued </td> <td>$40,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$20,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity date \u2020 </td> <td>March 30, 2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2026 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial fixed interest rate </td> <td>6.875% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial interest rate period </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First interest rate change date \u2020 </td> <td>March 30, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment frequency through year five </td> <td>Semiannually </td> <td> </td> <td>Semiannually </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment frequency after five years </td> <td>Quarterly </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarterly </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest repricing index and margin </td> <td>3-month LIBOR\nplus 5.636% </td> <td> </td> <td>3-month LIBOR\nplus 6.04% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repricing frequency </td> <td>Quarterly </td> <td> </td> <td>Quarterly </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2020 The March 2016 Subordinated Notes are redeemable at the Company's option in whole or in part on or after March 30, 2021, and the June 2016 Subordinated Notes are redeemable at the Company's option in whole or in part on or after July 1, 2021.\nFor more detail related to the subordinated notes, please see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nShareholders' equity was $410,333 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $37,593, or 10.1%, from $372,740 at December 31, 2018. Common dividends of $2,636 were paid during 2019, and no common dividends were paid during 2018 and 2017.\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action.\nThe final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Under the Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets (\"RWA\"). Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016 and the requirements were fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer threshold for 2019 was 2.5%. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% will not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% will be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The rule also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum capital ratios of (i) 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% Total Capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization's quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. Now that the new rule is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer exceed the prompt corrective action ( PCA\u201d) well-capitalized thresholds.\nPCA regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At December 31, 2019, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution's category.\nManagement believes as of December 31, 2019, the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Actual and required capital amounts and ratios are presented below as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for the Company and Bank.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

net of unearned income, excludes non-accrual loans.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost-effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, management focuses on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet the Company's needs. Our source of funds to pay interest on our March 2016 Notes and June 2016 Notes is generally in the form of a dividend from the Bank to the Company, or those payments may be serviced from cash balances held by the Company. The Bank's ability to pay a dividend may be restricted due to regulatory requirements as well as the Bank's future earnings and capital needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, payments of principal and interest as well as sales of investments classified as available-for-sale, and sales of brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2019, the entire investment securities portfolio, totaling $652,132, was classified as AFS and is reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. None of the portfolio was classified as HTM at December 31, 2019. Approximately $294,585 of the total $652,132 investment securities portfolio on hand at December 31, 2019, was pledged to secure public deposits and CRA investments. Other funding sources available include repurchase\nagreements, federal funds purchased, and borrowings from the FHLB. For more detail regarding funding sources see Note 10 and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation affects financial institutions' increased cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and shareholders' equity. Commercial and other loan originations and refinancing tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce the Company's earnings from such activities.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company generally does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than approved and unfunded loans and lines and letters of credit to customers in the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2019, the Company had unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $48,999, unused lines of credit of $790,366, and outstanding standby letters of credit of $55,869.\nGAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSome of the financial data included in our selected historical consolidated financial information are not measures of financial performance recognized by GAAP. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of our performance:\n\u2022 Common equity\u201d is defined as total shareholders' equity at end of period less the liquidation preference value of the preferred stock;\n\u2022 Tangible common equity\u201d is common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022 Total tangible assets\u201d is defined as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022 Other intangible assets\u201d is defined as the sum of core deposit intangible and SBA servicing rights;\n\u2022 Tangible book value per share\u201d is defined as tangible common equity divided by total common shares outstanding. This measure is important to investors interested in changes from period-to-period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets;\n\u2022 Tangible common equity ratio\u201d is defined as the ratio of tangible common equity divided by total tangible assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from period-to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets;\n\u2022 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity\u201d is defined as net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity;\n\u2022 Efficiency ratio\u201d is defined as noninterest expenses divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income;\n\u2022 Adjusted yield on loans\u201d is our yield on loans after excluding loan accretion from our acquired loan portfolio. Our management uses this metric to better assess the impact of purchase accounting on our yield on loans, as the effect of loan discount accretion is expected to decrease as the acquired loans mature or roll off of our balance sheet;\n\u2022 Net interest margin\u201d is defined as annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets for the period; and\n\u2022 Adjusted net interest margin\u201d is net interest margin after excluding loan accretion from the acquired loan portfolio and premiums for acquired time deposits. Our management uses this metric to better assess the\nimpact of purchase accounting on net interest margin, as the effect of loan discount accretion and accretion of net discounts and premiums related to deposits is expected to decrease as the acquired loans and deposits mature or roll off of our balance sheet.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, we acknowledge that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (All dollar values in this section are in thousands.)\nThe following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. The detailed financial discussion that follows focuses on 2019 results compared to 2018. For a discussion of 2018 results compared to 2017 see the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results, including those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.\nThe Company's accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The critical accounting policies require judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. Management has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief summary of the more significant policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes a loan has become noncollectable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDR) and classified as impaired.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nAll loans classified as substandard or worse are individually evaluated for potential designation as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nTDRs are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For TDRs that subsequently default, the Bank determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on a combination of the Bank's loss history and loss history from the Bank's peer group. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.\nOverview\nThe Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $14,822, compared to $34,521 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $28,099 for the year ended December 31, 2017. After earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, the Company's net earnings available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $14,806, $34,505, and $28,083, respectively. Net earnings available to shareholders decreased by $19,699 when comparing 2019 with 2018, primarily driven by specific reserves of $9,759 related to a Shared National Credit ( SNC\u201d) relationship, and $20,657 related to two lending relationships in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios discussed below, along with $4,301 related to post-employment and retirement expense recorded during 2019. Interest income increased $14,747 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 mainly due to an increased volume of loans and fluctuating rates during 2019.\nIn connection with our year-end audit process, and subsequent to our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019, we have determined the need to record an additional loan loss provision of $18,761 to provide specific reserves for two lending relationships, which were both on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2019 and comprised a material portion of our classified assets, in our healthcare and corporate loan portfolios. Our determination to record this additional provision was primarily the result of certain developments and circumstances regarding the collectability of these two relationships that arose following our earnings release, and have been amplified by various macroeconomic developments. Under GAAP we are required to reflect the additional provision during the fourth quarter of 2019, and the specific reserves as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, this Form 10-K reflects the updated provision and reserves and, as a result, contains financial information that is different than the information previously presented in our January 21, 2020 earnings release related to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFurthermore at this time, we expect to experience certain ongoing lending and depository losses occurring during the first quarter of 2020 related to at least one of these relationships, which would be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of 2020. We continue to monitor these two relationships, and we could experience additional losses attributed to these relationships in future periods.\nPlanned Reduction of Non-Strategic Loan Portfolio\nAs previously announced, on January 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with FB Financial Corporation ( FB Financial\u201d), pursuant to which the Company will merge into FB Financial, with FB Financial continuing as the surviving corporation (the merger\u201d). In connection with the announcement of the merger, FB Financial identified a group of nonstrategic loans that would be liquidated in connection with the consummation of the merger. As disclosed in FB Financials' merger investor presentation, the nonstrategic loans were comprised of shared national credits, corporate and healthcare lending relationships totaling approximately $429,500 at December 31, 2019, including criticized and classified loans totaling approximately $39,100, of which the two lending relationships identified above were included.\nThe Company has been in communication with FB Financial regarding its determination to record the additional 2019 provision for loan losses and specific reserves described above. The specific reserves discussed above are consistent with the overall anticipated impact of the liquidation of the nonstrategic loans and FB Financials' aggregate estimated credit marks associated with the acquired loan portfolio as disclosed in their merger investor presentation. Additionally, as a result of subsequent loans sales, payoffs and other ordinary course changes, the nonstrategic loans totaled approximately $412,600 as of February 28, 2020, reflecting a decrease of approximately $16,900 from December 31, 2019, which represents a 23.5% annualized decrease. The Company expects to continue to experience loan payoffs, customer migration and other ordinary course changes in this portfolio during the coming periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the presentation of loans and other assets as held for sale when the criteria for such classification are met.\nNet Interest Income/Margin\nNet interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets, less interest expense. Net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $111,160, $105,503, and $97,046, respectively, which is an increase of $5,657, or 5.4%, comparing 2019 and 2018, and an increase of $8,457, or 8.7%, comparing 2018 and 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income increased $14,747 and $37,492 primarily due to an asset rotation away from lower-yielding securities combined with growth in the loan portfolio. These were partially offset by increases of $9,090 and $29,035 in interest expense, which totaled $73,532, $64,442, and $35,407, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increases in interest-bearing deposits combined with increases in interest rates for money market deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances during 2019 and 2018 which had an impact on the cost of funds for the Bank.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $3,867,484, $3,995,592, and $3,361,320 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which is a decrease of $128,108, or 3.2%, and an increase of $634,272, or 18.9%, respectively, primarily due to significant growth in loans.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, average loans held for investment increased 14.3% and 22.5%, respectively, and investment securities decreased 36.3% during 2019 and increased 9.9% during 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our earning asset yield increased by 51 basis points and 21 basis points from the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while the total funding rates increased by 40 basis points and 64 basis points compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in yields throughout all three periods presented is primarily caused by fluctuations in the rate environment, intense competition, and our continued balance sheet rotation strategy.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the yield on taxable securities were 2.69%, 2.39% and 2.27%, respectively. The increase in yield in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates and a reduction in lower-yielding securities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the yield on tax exempt securities were 3.82%, 4.53% and 5.24%, respectively. The decrease in yield in 2019 is primarily due to the strategically-planned balance sheet rotation focused on core loan growth.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $3,255,747, $3,465,110, and $2,891,943, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which is a decrease of $209,363 or 6.0%, during 2019 compared to an increase of $573,167, or 19.8%, during 2018. The decrease for 2019 was due primarily to reduction in time deposits. The increases for 2018 and 2017 were due to growth in interest checking, money market deposits, time deposits and FHLB advances during these two years.\nDuring 2019, total average interest-bearing deposits decreased by $182,180, which included a decrease in average interest checking of $64,760, an increase of average money market accounts of $316,616, and a decrease in average time deposits outstanding of $426,060. During 2018, total average interest-bearing deposits grew $511,126, which included increases in average interest checking of $205,366, average money market accounts of $141,863, and average time deposits outstanding of $171,574.\nWith the decrease in the average loan portfolio during 2019, the average FHLB advances decreased by $15,173. Average FHLB advances increased $81,578 in 2018 as the average loans grew. Subordinated notes and other borrowings increased by $177 and $178, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases in 2019 and 2018 were due to the amortization of borrowing costs.\nThe cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 40 basis points to 2.26% during 2019 and increased 64 basis points to 1.86% during 2018. The increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities for 2019 and 2018 was due to increases in rates on interest checking, money market accounts, time deposits, FHLB advances and Federal funds purchased.\nThe tables below summarize average balances, yields, cost of funds, and the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nAverage Balances(7)-Yields & Rates\n(Dollars in thousands)\n\n(1)Loan balances include loans held in the Bank's portfolio and are net of deferred origination fees and costs. Non-accrual loans are included in total loan balances.\n(2)Includes federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank and other financial institutions.\n(3)Includes repurchase agreements.\n(4)Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\n(5)Represents net interest income (annualized) divided by total average earning assets.\n(6)Interest income and rates include the effects of tax-equivalent adjustments to adjust tax-exempt interest income on tax-exempt loans and investment securities to a fully taxable basis.\n(7)Average balances are average daily balances.\n(8)Includes finance lease.\nThe tables below detail the components of the changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volume and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category. The changes noted in the table below include tax equivalent adjustments, and as a result, will not agree to the amounts reflected on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the categories that have been adjusted to reflect tax equivalent income.\nAnalysis of Changes in Interest Income and Expenses\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

The decrease in yield in 2019 is primarily due to the strategically-planned balance sheet rotation focused on core loan growth.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $3,255,747, $3,465,110, and $2,891,943, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which is a decrease of $209,363 or 6.0%, during 2019 compared to an increase of $573,167, or 19.8%, during 2018. The decrease for 2019 was due primarily to reduction in time deposits. The increases for 2018 and 2017 were due to growth in interest checking, money market deposits, time deposits and FHLB advances during these two years.\nDuring 2019, total average interest-bearing deposits decreased by $182,180, which included a decrease in average interest checking of $64,760, an increase of average money market accounts of $316,616, and a decrease in average time deposits outstanding of $426,060. During 2018, total average interest-bearing deposits grew $511,126, which included increases in average interest checking of $205,366, average money market accounts of $141,863, and average time deposits outstanding of $171,574.\nWith the decrease in the average loan portfolio during 2019, the average FHLB advances decreased by $15,173. Average FHLB advances increased $81,578 in 2018 as the average loans grew. Subordinated notes and other borrowings increased by $177 and $178, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases in 2019 and 2018 were due to the amortization of borrowing costs.\nThe cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 40 basis points to 2.26% during 2019 and increased 64 basis points to 1.86% during 2018. The increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities for 2019 and 2018 was due to increases in rates on interest checking, money market accounts, time deposits, FHLB advances and Federal funds purchased.\nThe tables below summarize average balances, yields, cost of funds, and the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and
