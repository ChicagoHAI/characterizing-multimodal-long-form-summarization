Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nZendesk's mission is to help organizations and their customers build better relationships. We are a software development company that provides a SaaS customer service platform that enables our customers to provide tailored support through multiple channels, establish effective self-service support resources, proactively serve customers through customer engagement capabilities, integrate with other applications, and consolidate and analyze data from customer interactions. We also provide SaaS live chat software that can be utilized independently to facilitate proactive communications between organizations and their customers or integrated easily into our platform.\nOur business model is designed to drive organic growth, leverage positive word-of-mouth, and remove friction from the evaluation and purchasing process. We offer a range of subscription account plans for our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software that vary in pricing based on functionality, the type and, for our customer service platform, the amount of product support we offer and service-level guarantees.\nOur largest source of qualified sales leads is free trials of our customer service platform commenced by prospects. For larger organizations, our sales team focuses on a land and expand strategy, which leverages this grassroots adoption and seeks to expand our footprint within organizations. More recently we are developing and expanding our field sales and marketing teams primarily responsible for lead discovery, qualification, and account management for larger organizations. Many of our existing customers to date have been small to medium sized organizations that make purchasing decisions with limited interaction with our sales or other personnel; as we continue to focus on and become more dependent on sales to larger organizations and increase our investment in paid sources of qualified leads, we expect the percentage of qualified leads that come unpaid sources, such as organic search and customer referrals, to decrease and our sales cycles to lengthen and become less predictable.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of WAC. With the acquisition, we added technology that we anticipate will allow our customers to understand the ever-increasing diversity of data about their end customers. Over time, we expect this analytics software to become a core technology within our customer service platform, enabling us to further integrate data analytics capabilities across our products. We also expect to continue to sell our analytics software on a standalone basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our revenue was $208.8 million, $127.0 million, and $72.0 million, respectively, representing a 64% growth rate from 2014 to 2015 and 76% growth rate from 2013 to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 we derived $92.5 million, or 44%, $54.8 million, or 43%, and $29.6 million, or 41%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we generated net losses of $84.1 million, $67.4 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. We intend to invest aggressively to drive continued growth and market leadership.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depends on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business, or SMB, market, expand our enterprise customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected addition of new personnel and the investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including investments in additional capacity in data centers, leasehold improvements and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest in additional data center capacity and personnel to support our growth. The amount and timing of these investments will vary based on our estimates of projected growth. We also expect to continue to grow our customer support organization including expanding our product support and professional services teams. While we have moved significant portions of the hosting for our core platform to self-managed colocation data centers, improvements to our gross margin from such move have been partially offset by other hosting expenses, primarily related to the support of our platform infrastructure. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by utilizing capacity within our self-managed colocation data centers, efficient use of other hosting resources, and reducing the need for direct incremental personnel costs resulting from growth in our number of customers. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the future, although our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support team, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as amortization costs associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to introduce new products, broaden the functionality of our customer service platform, our live chat software, and our analytics software and to further integrate these products and services. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our enterprise customer base. We also expect to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts on our customer service platform and live chat software is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on our customer service platform, exclusive of our Starter plan, free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts using our live chat software, exclusive of free trials or other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier. Use of our customer service platform and live chat software requires separate subscriptions and each of these accounts are treated as separate paid customer account. Existing customers may also expand their utilization of our customer service platform or live chat software by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our customer service platform and live chat software to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. An increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our platform, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities. We do not currently incorporate accounts using our analytics software into determination of the number of paid customer accounts. We had approximately 69,100 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015, including approximately 35,700 paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and approximately 33,400 paid customer accounts using our live chat software. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline.\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we introduced our Essential plan for our customer service platform. This plan replaced our Starter plan as the least expensive paid plan on our customer service platform. Following the introduction of our Essential plan, we no longer made our Starter plan available for new accounts. Accounts that subscribe to our Essential plan are included in the determination of the number of paid customer accounts.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our customer service platform. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account on our customer service platform, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our customer service platform. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and upgrades in subscription plan, as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our live chat software or our analytics software into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our monthly recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our customer service platform. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any one-time discounts or any platform usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the paid customer accounts on our customer service platform as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving the transfer of agents between paid customer accounts, consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation results in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 32,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 35,700 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 123% as of December 31, 2015. We expect our dollar-based net expansion rate to decline over time as our aggregate monthly recurring revenue grows.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on our customer service platform and, to a lesser extent, live chat and analytics software. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each such user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans that vary in pricing based on functionality and, for our customer service platform, the type and amount of product support, and service-level commitments. Certain arrangements provide for unlimited usage for a fixed fee or incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Additionally, because of the mix of payment frequencies and contract lengths, we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful performance metric.\nWe derive an immaterial amount of revenue from implementation, voice usage, and training services, for which we recognize revenue upon completion.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, depreciation, hosting, and other expenses associated with our data centers, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, payment processing fees, third party license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, shared information technology and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nCurrently, we primarily operate out of four self-managed colocation data centers, in which we manage our own network equipment and systems, located in California, Virginia, Ireland, and Germany. Our live chat software was originally hosted in a managed hosting facility in Florida and in January 2015, we migrated all accounts to our self-managed colocation facility in Ireland. In addition, we utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia to support our platform infrastructure, for certain research and development purposes, and to host our analytics software. We intend to increase capacity in self-managed colocation data centers and/or with third-party managed hosting services over time to support our growth.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, through acquisitions and organically. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to incur ongoing capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capability of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software but also increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our products or for certain subscription plans, we expect third- party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such products and subscription plans to remain significant over time as we increase the number of customers using such products and subscription plans.\nGross Margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and costs associated with capitalized internal-use software. Although we expect that certain third- party technology license fees will remain significant, we expect these costs to decrease over time as we take steps necessary to secure long term access to such technology.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our products. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, commissions, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include online lead generation, advertising, promotional events, and public and community relations. Sales commissions and other incremental costs to acquire contracts are expensed as incurred.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our products, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of direct sales employees, developing our field sales and marketing teams, expanding our indirect sales channels, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services, and other corporate expenses and allocated shared costs.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, tax, and accounting services fees, insurance costs, board of directors' compensation and costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, executing significant transactions, including acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) and interest expense associated with our credit facility (terminated in June 2015), offset by interest income from marketable securities.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following

both a service condition and a performance condition, or Performance Awards. The service condition for substantially all of the Performance Awards is satisfied over four years. The performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. No share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the Performance Awards prior to the IPO. Upon the satisfaction of the performance condition in May 2014, we recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense for the portion of the Performance Awards that had met the service condition, with the remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards was $6.1 million and $12.7 million, including $0.2 million and $0.9 million in cost of revenue, $4.3 million and $7.8 million in research and development, $1.0 million and $2.4 million in sales and marketing, and $0.6 million and $1.6 million in general and administrative expenses, respectively.\nRevenue\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased $81.7 million, or 64%, in 2015 compared to 2014.

Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, we adjusted the acquisition date of customer accounts to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify as involving the transfer of agents from an existing customer account to a new customer account, or the split of an existing customer account into multiple customer accounts. In addition, revenue from customer accounts that share common corporate information is treated as being generated from a single customer account. The acquisition date of customer accounts that share common corporate information is determined using the establishment date of the earliest customer account. The increases in revenue attributable to new and existing accounts from 2013 to 2014 have been retrospectively adjusted to apply the revised customer acquisition date methodology.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $21.1 million, or 46%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $7.4 million driven by our headcount growth, as well as increased depreciation expense and other costs of $4.4 million. The increase in depreciation expense and other costs was due to building out and increasing capacity within our self-managed colocation data centers. The increase was also driven by increased amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software of $2.4 million, as we continue to develop additional features and functionalities of our platform. Further contributing to the increased cost of revenue was an increase in allocated shared costs of $2.3 million primarily due to increased facilities and information technology expenses.\nOur gross margin increased by 4.0 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. The improvement was primarily driven by a decrease of 2.0 percentage points in employee-related compensation costs, and a decrease of 1.5 percentage points in hosting fees as a percentage of revenue. The decreased employee-related compensation costs as a percentage of revenue were due to our ability to increase revenue with a more moderate increase in headcount. The decreased hosting fees as a percentage of revenue reflect increased cost efficiency as we expanded operations in our self-managed colocation data centers.\nCost of revenue increased $21.5 million, or 88%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs of $9.5 million associated with our substantial increase in headcount, share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards described above, increased depreciation expense and other costs associated with our self-managed colocation data centers of $2.9 million driven by our investments in building out and increasing capacity within our self-managed colocation data centers, and increased amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software of $1.5 million as we continue to develop additional features and functionalities of our platform. Further contributing to the increase was $1.2 million in hosting fees as we increased data center capacity to support our growth, an increase of $1.2 million in amortization expense of acquired intangibles in connection with our acquisition of Zopim, and an increase of $3.4 million in allocated shared costs primarily due to increased facilities expenses.\nOur gross margin decreased by 2.2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.6 percentage point increase in employee-related compensation costs, driven by increased share-based compensation expense, and a 1.1 percentage point increase in allocated shared costs as a percentage of revenue, offset by a 1.7 percentage point decrease in hosting fees as a percentage of revenue driven by efficiency realized from our investments in building out our self-managed colocation data centers.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $26.2 million, or 72% in 2015 compared to 2014.

Trends in Revenue and Cost of Revenue\nOur quarterly revenue increased sequentially for each period presented, primarily due to sales of new subscriptions to our products and net expansion by our existing customers. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential growth in revenue will continue. In future periods, as our rate of revenue growth declines, seasonality in our revenue may become more apparent.\nOur gross margin in the first quarter of any fiscal year is negatively impacted relative to the preceding fourth quarter due to the fewer number of days in the first quarter over which we record subscription revenue as compared to the preceding fourth quarter and the fact that certain expenses in our cost of revenue are not sensitive to the number of days in the quarter.\nQuarterly Trends in Costs and Expenses\nOur quarterly costs and expenses increased sequentially for each period presented, primarily due to increased compensation-related costs related to an increase in headcount in connection with the expansion of our business. In the three months ended June 30, 2014, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $6.1 million related to the Performance Awards. Of the total share-based compensation expense, we recorded $0.6 million in cost of revenue, $3.2 million in research and development, $1.3 million in sales and marketing, and $1.0 million in general and administrative expenses, respectively. In addition, in the three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded $2.8 million in share-based compensation expense as a component of sales and marketing expenses related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock awards.\nCredit Facility\nUntil its termination in June 2015, we had a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank consisting of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and a $10.0 million equipment line of credit. The revolving line of credit bore interest at the prime rate plus 2.0% per annum prior to our IPO and was reduced to the prime rate upon the consummation of our IPO. Borrowings on the equipment line of credit bore interest of 2.5% per annum. In June 2014, we repaid all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the revolving line of credit. In June 2015, we repaid all outstanding principal and interest under the equipment line of credit and terminated the Silicon Valley Bank credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $268.0 million. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate bonds, money market funds, asset backed securities, commercial paper and agency securities.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,721\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71,297\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,186\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities. From our inception through December 31, 2015, we have received cash proceeds of $364.7 million from the sale of equity securities, net of issuance costs paid. We have also financed our operations through customer payments for subscription to our customer service platform, live-chat software and analytics software, as well as borrowings under our credit facility. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including growth in our customer accounts and continued customer expansion, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, ongoing investments in our platform infrastructure, and the introduction of new and enhanced products, features and functionality. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of WAC. We acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of WAC in exchange for purchase consideration of $46.3 million in cash, including working capital adjustments. As partial security for standard indemnification obligations, $7.0 million of the consideration is held in escrow for a period of up to 18 months, with a portion to be released 12 months following the closing of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of WAC, we have also entered into retention arrangements pursuant to which we have issued restricted stock unit awards for an aggregate of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock, subject to vesting based on continued employment.\nIn March 2014, we completed the acquisition of Zopim. The purchase price of approximately $15.8 million ($4.9 million of cash and $10.9 million of our common stock) includes $1.1 million of cash and $2.4 million of common stock consideration held back between 12 and 18 months as partial security for standard indemnification obligations and which are payable in the future under terms specified in the stock purchase agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Zopim, we established a retention plan pursuant to which we will pay up to $13.9 million in cash and equity consideration over two and three years, respectively, to Zopim employees in connection with their continued employment.\nPrior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements in connection with our IPO, we had elected to net share settle our RSUs by withholding shares and remitting income tax on behalf of the applicable employees. Upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements in November 2014, we generally began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of RSUs in order to cover any required withholding taxes (sell-to-cover). This sell-to-cover approach reduced our cash outflows.\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers for subscription services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, leased facilities, and hosting fees.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $5.3 million, reflecting our net loss of $84.1 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $52.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $19.7 million, and changes in our working capital. The changes in our working capital were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $33.9 million due to the growth of our subscription services, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.2 million due to timing of payments and a higher level of expenses consistent with the overall growth of our business, and an increase in accrued compensation liabilities of $1.7 million primarily due to an increase in headcount and timing of payments. These sources of cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $15.0 million due to higher customer billings related to the increase in subscription services during the period and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.7 million, primarily due to increases in restricted cash pledged for charitable donation, prepaid subscriptions for software used in our operations, and prepaid rent.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $2.1 million, reflecting our net loss of $67.4 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including share-based compensation expense of $32.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $11.5 million, and changes in our working capital. The changes in our working capital were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $22.4 million due to the growth of our subscription services, an increase in accrued compensation liabilities of $5.8 million primarily due to a significant increase in headcount and timing of payments, an increase in other assets and liabilities of $1.7 million due to increased deferred rent, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.3 million due to timing of payments and a higher level of expenses consistent with the overall growth of our business. These sources of cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $3.8 million due to higher customer billings related to the increase in subscription services during the period and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.4 million primarily due to increases in prepaid subscriptions of business software.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $4.0 million, reflecting our net loss of $22.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including depreciation and amortization of $5.2 million, share-based compensation expense of $4.9 million, and changes in our working capital. The changes in our working capital were primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue of $13.9 million due to the growth of our subscription services, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.1 million due to timing of payments and a higher level of expenses consistent with the overall growth of our business, and an increase in accrued compensation liabilities of $2.0 million primarily due to a significant increase in headcount. These sources of cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6 million due to higher customer billings related to the increase in subscription services during the period and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.3 million primarily due to increases in prepaid rent.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 of $72.7 million was primarily attributable to cash paid for the acquisition of WAC, net of cash acquired of $42.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $23.0 million primarily associated with hosting equipment to build out our self-managed colocation data centers, capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.7 million associated with the development of additional features and functionality of our platform, purchases of marketable securities of $1.2 million, net of sales and maturities, and payments of $1.1 million in purchase consideration previously held back in connection with the acquisition of Zopim.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2014 of $71.3 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $39.9 million, net of sales and maturities, purchases of property and equipment of $21.7 million primarily associated with leasehold improvements related to our new offices and hosting equipment, capitalized internal-use software costs of $8.0 million associated with the development of additional features and functionality of our platform, and payments of $1.9 million for the acquisition of Zopim, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2013 of $24.2 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities of $12.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $7.1 million primarily associated with hosting equipment to build out our self-managed colocation data centers, and capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.7 million associated with the development of additional features and functionality of our platform.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of $203.1 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the follow-on public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs, of $190.1 million, proceeds from exercise of stock options of $10.6 million, and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $9.5 million. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit facility of $7.0 million in connection with the termination of our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2014 of $95.8 million was primarily attributable to net proceeds from our initial public offering of $103.1 million, proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee equity plans of $11.6 million, and borrowings under our credit facility of $3.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by principal payments on our credit facility of $20.7 million and payments for withholding taxes related to the net share settlement of RSUs of $2.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2013 of $25.2 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility of $23.8 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options of $1.8 million, partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations of $0.3 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases for office space, and contractual commitments for hosting and other support services. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct transactions, particularly intercompany transactions, in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar, Danish Krone, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Philippine peso, and Brazilian Real. While we have primarily transacted with customers in the U.S. dollar, we have also historically transacted in foreign currencies for subscriptions to our customer service platform and expect to significantly expand the number of transactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies in the near future. Except for our Singapore subsidiary, our international subsidiaries maintain certain monetary assets and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of these entities, which is the U.S. dollar. Our Singapore subsidiary's functional currency is the Singapore Dollar. Changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can result in fluctuations in our total assets, liabilities, revenue, operating expenses, and cash flows.\nForeign currency gains and losses were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In September 2015, we implemented a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings. For additional information, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $268.0 million at December 31, 2015, of which $73.1 million was invested in corporate bonds, money market funds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities and agency securities. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Our investments in marketable securities are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale,\u201d no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.\nAs of December 31, 2015, an immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of our cash equivalents and portfolio of marketable securities of approximately $0.4 million. Fluctuations in the value of our cash equivalents and portfolio of marketable securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on our customer service platform and, to a lesser extent, live chat software and analytics software. In addition, we generate revenue by providing additional features to certain of our subscription plans for a fee that is incremental to the base subscription rate for such plan. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting our customer service platform or live chat software at any time, and are therefore accounted for as service contracts. Subscription service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations or any other right of return. We record revenue net of sales or excise taxes.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The service has been or is being provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nCertain customers have arrangements that provide for a maximum number of users over the contract term, with usage measured monthly. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract terms. Incremental fees are incurred when the maximum number of users is exceeded, and any incremental fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining contractual term.\nWe derive an immaterial amount of revenue from implementation, voice usage, and training services, for which we recognize revenue upon completion.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with software development for our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The weighted-average useful life of our capitalized internal-use software was 3.0 years as of December 31, 2015. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairments to internal-use software during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the consolidated level, as we operate as a single reporting unit.\nAcquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives following the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed, generally straight-line. The carrying amounts of our acquired intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense to employees is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We measure the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, based on the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nPrior to our IPO, we granted Performance Awards to our employees that vested upon the satisfaction of both a service condition, generally over four years, and a performance condition. The performance condition, defined as a qualifying liquidation event, was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. No share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the Performance Awards prior to the IPO as such qualifying liquidation event was not deemed probable until that time. Upon the satisfaction of the performance condition, we recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense for the portion of the Performance Awards that had met the service condition, with the remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. Share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards was $6.1 million and $12.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Expected Term. We determine the expected term based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options vesting term and contractual expiration period, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatility of publicly traded industry peers. To determine our peer group of companies, we consider public companies in the technology industry and select those that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We do not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity is relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this methodology using the same or similar public companies until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term of the stock options for each stock option group\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Dividend Yield. We have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions, other than fair value of our common stock, relating to our stock options granted in the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49% - 54%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54% - 56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50% - 63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4% - 2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.75% - 2.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.63% - 2.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.02 - 6.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.02 - 6.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.47 - 6.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate utilized in our share-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\nItem 8.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Zendesk, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \u2003\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Zendesk Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, CA\nFebruary 26, 2016\nReport of Ernst & Young, LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Zendesk, Inc.\nWe have audited Zendesk, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), ( the COSO criteria\u201d). Zendesk Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Zendesk, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Zendesk Inc. and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 26, 2016\nZENDESK, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

Organization\nZendesk was founded in Denmark in 2007 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 2009.\nOur mission is to help organizations and their customers build better relationships. We are a software development company that provides a SaaS customer service platform that enables our customers to provide tailored support through multiple channels, establish effective self-service support resources, proactively serve customers through customer engagement capabilities, integrate with other applications, and consolidate and analyze data from customer interactions. We also provide SaaS live chat software that can be utilized independently to facilitate proactive communications between organizations and their customers or integrated easily into our platform.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of We Are Cloud SAS, or WAC, the maker of BIME Analytics software. With the acquisition, we added technology that we anticipate will allow our customers to understand the ever-increasing diversity of data about their end customers. Over time, we expect this analytics software to become a core technology within our customer service platform, enabling us to further integrate data analytics capabilities across our products. We also expect to continue to sell our analytics software on a standalone basis.\nReferences to Zendesk, the Company\u201d, our\u201d, or we\u201d in these notes refer to Zendesk, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zendesk, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn May 2014, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, in which we issued and sold 12.8 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $9.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $103.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.1 million and other offering expenses of $3.8 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all shares of our then-outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an aggregate of 34.3 million shares of common stock.\nFollow-On Public Offering\nIn March 2015, we completed a follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 8.8 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.75 per share. We received net proceeds of $190.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.7 million and other offering expenses of $0.9 million.\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods.\nSignificant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the fair value of our common stock (through the date of our IPO) and share-based awards, fair value of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, unrecognized tax benefits, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, and the capitalization and estimated useful life of our capitalized internal-use software.\nThese estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSegment Information\nOur chief operating decision maker reviews the financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating our financial performance. Accordingly, we have determined that we operate in a single operating segment.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on our customer service platform and, to a lesser extent, live chat software, and analytics software. In addition, we generate revenue by providing additional features to certain of our subscription plans for a fee that is incremental to the base subscription rate for such plan. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting our customer service platform or live chat software at any time, and are therefore accounted for as service contracts. Subscription service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations or any other right of return. We record revenue net of sales or excise taxes.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The service has been or is being provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nCertain customers have arrangements that provide for a maximum number of users over the contract term, with usage measured monthly. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract terms. Incremental fees are incurred when the maximum number of users is exceeded, and any incremental fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining contractual term.\nWe derive an immaterial amount of revenue from implementation, voice usage, and training services, for which we recognize revenue upon completion.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists primarily of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized. We invoice customers for subscriptions to our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software in monthly, quarterly, or annual installments. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent deferred revenue. Deferred revenue associated with implementation, voice usage, and training services was immaterial as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our platform infrastructure and our product support organizations, depreciation, hosting, and other expenses associated with our data centers, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, payment processing fees, third party license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated shared costs, including facilities, shared information technology and security costs.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nWe consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at fair value and consist primarily of bank deposits and money market funds.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our restricted cash balance was $1.3 million, consisting of $0.9 million pledged for charitable donation and $0.4 million related to a deposit for a leased building. There was no restricted cash as of December 31, 2014. Restricted cash is included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist of corporate bonds, asset backed securities, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities and agency securities. We classify marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. All marketable securities are recorded at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are recorded in other comprehensive loss. We evaluate our investments to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired. Impairments are considered other than temporary if they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely we will sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the age of each past due invoice, and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts consists of the following activity (in thousands):\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts, beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (782\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (861\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts, ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> Furniture and fixtures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hosting equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Computer equipment and software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation expense of assets acquired through capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts with certain financial institutions to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our future cash flows and earnings. All of our foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Our foreign currency forward contracts generally have maturities of fifteen months or less.\nWe recognize all forward contracts on our balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The effective portion of the gain or loss on each forward contract is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings to revenue, cost of revenue or operating expense in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses, if any, is recorded immediately in other income (expense), net. The change in time value related to our cash flow hedges is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is recorded immediately in other income (expense), net. We evaluate the effectiveness of our cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis.\nWe have a master netting agreement with each of our counterparties, which permits net settlement of multiple, separate derivative contracts with a single payment. We may also be required to exchange cash collateral with certain of our counterparties on a\nregular basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have not exchanged cash collateral with any counterparties. ASC 815 permits companies to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a net basis according to master netting arrangements. We have elected to present our derivative instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated financial statements. We do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value using a fair value hierarchy. A financial instrument's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.\nOur marketable securities are classified within either Level 1 or Level 2 and our foreign currency forward contracts are classified within Level 2. We have no financial assets or liabilities measured using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of our Level 1 marketable securities is based on quoted market prices of identical underlying securities. The fair value of our Level 2 marketable securities is based on indirect or directly observable market data, including readily available pricing sources for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets, such as currency spot rates, forward rates, and LIBOR.\nFor certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. Based on borrowing rates available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the carrying value of borrowings approximates fair value within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with software development for our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The weighted-average useful life of our capitalized internal-use software was 3.0 years as of December 31, 2015.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, and Impairment Assessment of Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAcquired Intangible Assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives following the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed, generally straight-line.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. The carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There were no material impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nShare Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense to employees is measured based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We measure the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, based on the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nAll RSUs and certain options granted to employees prior to the IPO vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. These RSUs and stock options with both a service condition and performance condition are collectively referred to as Performance Awards\u201d in the following discussion. The service condition for substantially all of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance condition was satisfied upon the occurrence of a qualifying liquidity event which occurred upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. No share-based compensation expense was recognized for the Performance Awards prior to the IPO as the performance condition had not been deemed probable to have been met. Upon the satisfaction of the performance condition in May 2014, we recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense for the portion of the Performance Awards that had met the service condition. The remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards was $6.1 million and $12.7 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31 2015, we had a total of $168.5 million in future period share-based compensation expense related to all equity awards, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.0 years.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, advertising expense was $16.5 million, $12.7 million, and $6.5 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have elected to record interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our consolidated financial statements as a component of provision for income taxes.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our Singapore subsidiary, is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary balance sheet accounts are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and non-monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Expenses are generally remeasured at the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains and losses are included in other expense, net on the statements of operations and were not material for the periods presented.\nThe functional currency of our Singapore subsidiary is the Singapore dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Amounts classified in stockholders' equity are translated at historical exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders' equity.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments potentially exposing us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high-credit-quality financial institutions. However, we maintain balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. We do not require our customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. We seek to mitigate counterparty credit risk related to our derivative instruments by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no customers that represented more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance. There were no customers that individually exceeded 10% of our revenue in any of the periods presented.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The purpose of this standard is to simplify the presentation of deferred liabilities and assets. We elected to prospectively adopt this standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material and prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d, which requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The new standard is required to be applied prospectively. We plan to adopt this guidance in our first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\u201d, which amended the existing accounting standards for intangible assets. The amendments provide explicit guidance to customers in determining the accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement, wherein the arrangements that do not convey a software license to the customer are accounted for as service contracts. We plan to adopt this guidance in our first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 regarding ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d This standard provides principles for recognizing revenue to which an entity expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendment may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption. We have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements, including revenue and commissions.\nNote 3. Business Combinations\nWe Are Cloud SAS\nOn October 13, 2015, we completed the acquisition of WAC, the maker of BIME Analytics software. We acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of WAC in exchange for purchase consideration of $46.3 million in cash, including working capital adjustments. As partial security for standard indemnification obligations, $7.0 million of the consideration will be held in escrow for a period of up to 18 months, with a portion to be released 12 months following the closing of the acquisition. We incurred transaction costs of $1.0 million in connection with the acquisition. The transaction costs were expensed as incurred and recognized within general and administrative expenses.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on a preliminary valuation and purchase price, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to working capital adjustments, the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, and residual goodwill. The total purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as set forth below (in thousands). The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is primarily attributable to expected synergies, including cost savings from integrating the analytics technology with our customer service platform and the opportunity to sell the analytics software alongside our existing products. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain indicators of impairment are present.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> Net tangible assets acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred tax liability recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,979\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Identifiable intangible assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Developed technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total purchase price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets were each assigned useful lives of 4.5 years.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we entered into retention arrangements with certain employees of WAC, pursuant to which we issued RSUs for approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock, most of which vest in three annual installments from the date of acquisition. The expense related to the RSUs will be accounted for as share-based compensation expense over the required service periods and was not included in the purchase consideration.\nThe results of operations of WAC have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2014, the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The unaudited pro forma results include: (i) recognition of the post-acquisition share-based compensation and other compensation expense; (ii) amortization associated with the acquired intangible assets, based on preliminary estimates of fair value; (iii) acquisition-related costs incurred by Zendesk and WAC; (iv) the impact of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and capitalized software; (v) the income tax benefit associated with WAC's historical loss before income taxes, and the pro forma adjustments.\nThe unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any cost saving synergies from operating efficiencies or the effect of the incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, nor are they indicative of future results of operations (in thousands):\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 210,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87,348\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74,670\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nZopim Technologies\nOn March 21, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd., or Zopim, a software development company that provides a SaaS live chat service. As of December 31, 2014, we finalized our purchase accounting after adjustments were made to the preliminary purchase price allocation. The total adjusted acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred was $15.8 million, including $4.9 million of cash and $10.9 million of our common stock, all of which was issued on the acquisition date. Of the total consideration transferred, $1.1 million of cash and $2.4 million of common stock consideration was held back between 12 and 18 months as partial security for standard indemnification obligations. These hold back amounts were released in equal installments in March and September 2015. The total adjusted purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as set forth below (in thousands). The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is attributable to expected synergies from future growth and potential future monetization opportunities, and is not deductible for tax purposes.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> Net tangible liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (385\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total purchase price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the acquisition, we also established a retention plan pursuant to which we issued RSUs for 0.9 million shares of our common stock, which vest in three annual installments from the date of acquisition. In addition, we agreed to pay cash in an aggregate amount of $3.0 million in two annual installments from the date of acquisition to Zopim employees in connection with their continued employment, which is recorded as compensation expense over the associated service periods of such employees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, RSUs for 0.3 million shares of our common stock became vested pursuant to the terms of the retention plan, and we paid the first installment of the cash retention bonus in the amount of $1.5 million.\nPro forma revenue and results of operations have not been presented because the historical results of Zopim were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any period presented.\nNote 4.

Credit Facility\nUntil its termination in June 2015, we had a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank consisting of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and a $10.0 million equipment line of credit. The revolving line of credit bore interest at the prime rate plus 2.0% per annum prior to our IPO and was reduced to the prime rate upon the consummation of our IPO. Borrowings on the equipment line of credit bore interest of 2.5% per annum. In June 2014, we repaid all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the revolving line of credit. In June 2015, we repaid all outstanding principal and interest under the equipment line of credit and terminated the Silicon Valley Bank credit facility.\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nWe lease office space under noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates. Certain of the office space lease agreements contain rent holidays or rent escalation provisions. Rent holiday and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the straight-line expense to be recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, rent expense was $7.5 million, $6.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Deferred rent of $6.9 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in other liabilities.\nWe leased computer equipment from various parties under capital lease agreements that expired in March 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the future minimum lease payments by year under noncancelable operating leases are as follows for the years ending December 31 (in thousands):\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total minimum lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a total of $3.7 million in unsecured letters of credit outstanding primarily related to our leased office space in San Francisco. These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through October 31, 2022.\nLitigation and Loss Contingencies\nWe accrue estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable. From time to time, we may become a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims, labor and employment claims, and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax, and other matters. We currently have no material pending litigation.\nWe are not currently aware of any litigation matters or loss contingencies that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated balance sheets, results of operations, comprehensive loss, or cash flows.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties, and other liabilities relating to or arising from our customer service platform, live chat software, analytics software, or our acts or omissions. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations may vary. To date, we have not incurred any material costs, and we have not accrued any liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as a result of these obligations.\nCertain of our product offerings include service-level agreements warranting defined levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits for future services in the event that we fail to meet those levels. To date, we have not accrued for any significant liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of these service-level agreements.\nNote 9. Common Stock and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of our IPO, we increased the number of shares authorized for issuance from 125 million to 400 million with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO, all outstanding convertible preferred stock was converted into 34.3 million shares of common stock.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 10 million shares of preferred stock were authorized for issuance with a par value of $0.01 per share and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.\nEmployee Equity Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur board of directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, in February 2014, which became effective in May 2014 upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are granted options to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP provides for eighteen-month offering periods, which include three six-month purchase periods. At the end of each purchase period, employees are able to purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of an offering period or the fair market value of our common stock at the end of the purchase period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 1.0 million and 0.4 million shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, the number of shares reserved under the ESPP increased by 0.9 million shares and 0.8 shares on January 1, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, 2.9 million shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.\nStock Option and Grant Plans\nOur board of directors adopted the 2009 Stock Option and Grant Plan, or the 2009 Plan, in July 2009. The 2009 Plan was terminated in connection with our IPO, and accordingly, no shares are available for issuance under this plan. The 2009 Plan continues to govern outstanding awards granted thereunder.\nOur 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan, serves as the successor to our 2009 Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan increased by 4.5 million and 3.8 million shares on January 1, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had 4.3 million shares of common stock available for future grants under the 2014 Plan.\nA summary of our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except per share information):\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Options Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> RSUs Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Remaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Intrinsic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Grant Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> for Grant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Exercise Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> RSUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding -

Aggregate intrinsic value for options exercised represents the difference between the exercise price and the market value on the date of exercise. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $12.44, $7.22, and $1.62, respectively.\nAggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding represents the difference between the closing stock price of our common stock and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-money options. Zendesk's closing stock price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange as of December 31, 2015 was $26.44.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nAll share-based awards to employees and members of our board of directors are measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). We record share-based compensation expense for service-based equity awards using the straight-line attribution method. We record share-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards using the accelerated attribution method.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Expected Term. We determine the expected term based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options vesting term and contractual expiration period, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatility of publicly traded industry peers. To determine our peer group of companies, we consider public companies in the technology industry and select those that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We do not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity is relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this methodology using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate.

Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements.\n\u00b7We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate utilized in our share-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded none and $4.3 million of share-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of stock options for terminated employees, respectively.\nEarly Exercise of Stock Options and Purchase of Unvested Stock Awards\nCertain of our stock options permit early exercise. Common stock purchased pursuant to an early exercise of stock options or unvested stock awards is not deemed to be outstanding for financial reporting purposes until those shares vest. Therefore, cash received in exchange for unvested shares is recorded as a liability and is transferred into common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest. Upon termination of service, we may, at our discretion, repurchase unvested shares acquired through early exercise of stock options or purchase of unvested stock awards at a price equal to the price per share paid upon the exercise of such options or the purchase of such unvested stock awards. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 there were 0.3 million and 0.6 million shares outstanding as a result of early exercise of stock options and purchase of unvested stock awards by our employees and directors that were classified as accrued liabilities for an aggregated amount of $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nTreasury Stock\nWe repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2011 and recorded the repurchased shares as treasury shares in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet at cost.\nNote 10. Net Loss Per Share\nWe compute net loss per share of common stock in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. We considered all series of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities as the holders of the preferred stock were entitled to receive a non-cumulative dividend on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is paid on common stock. We also consider shares of common stock issued upon the early exercise of stock options subject to repurchase to be participating securities, because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a dividend is paid on common stock. The holders of all series of the redeemable convertible preferred stock and the holders of shares of common stock acquired upon early exercise of stock options do not have a contractual obligation to share in our losses. As such, our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not allocated to these participating securities. Upon the closing of the IPO in May 2014, all shares of our then-outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into our common stock.\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less the weighted-average unvested common stock subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including common stock issuable upon conversion of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, outstanding share-based awards, and outstanding warrants, to the extent dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all potential common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember

subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $3.5 million. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $243.0 million for federal income taxes and $67.2 million for state income taxes. If not utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029 for federal purposes and 2031 for state purposes. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event that we had a change of ownership, utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be restricted. In addition, we have $3.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards in France resulting from our acquisition of WAC. These carryforward losses do not expire, however, utilization of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations. In addition, the right to the carryforward losses could be challenged if the French tax authorities determined that a significant change in the company's actual business has occurred.\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carryforwards, and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset our U.S. deferred tax assets, as we consider our cumulative loss in recent years to be strong negative evidence for retaining the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $25.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We will continue to assess the future realization of our deferred tax assets in each applicable jurisdiction and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately, $3.8 million and $4.1 million for federal and state income taxes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. The state tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely.\nA share option exercise may result in a tax deduction prior to the actual recognition of the related excess tax benefit because we have a net operating loss carryforward. Our net operating losses include $97.4 million of excess stock option benefits that will be creditable to additional paid in capital when realized.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions for tax positions related to the prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions for tax positions related to the current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lapse of statutes of limitations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions for tax positions related to the prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions for tax positions related to the current year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lapse of statutes of limitations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of interest and penalties related to the uncertain tax positions. We have elected to record interest and penalties in the financial statements as a component of income taxes. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are potential benefits of $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nWe are currently unaware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation in this estimate over the next 12 months.\nOur 2009-2014 tax years remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities for U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax purposes.\nNote 12.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal over control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nZendesk's mission is to help organizations and their customers build better relationships. We are a software development company that provides a SaaS customer service platform that enables our customers to provide tailored support through multiple channels, establish effective self-service support resources, proactively serve customers through customer engagement capabilities, integrate with other applications, and consolidate and analyze data from customer interactions. We also provide SaaS live chat software that can be utilized independently to facilitate proactive communications between organizations and their customers or integrated easily into our platform.\nOur business model is designed to drive organic growth, leverage positive word-of-mouth, and remove friction from the evaluation and purchasing process. We offer a range of subscription account plans for our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software that vary in pricing based on functionality, the type and, for our customer service platform, the amount of product support we offer and service-level guarantees.\nOur largest source of qualified sales leads is free trials of our customer service platform commenced by prospects. For larger organizations, our sales team focuses on a land and expand strategy, which leverages this grassroots adoption and seeks to expand our footprint within organizations. More recently we are developing and expanding our field sales and marketing teams primarily responsible for lead discovery, qualification, and account management for larger organizations. Many of our existing customers to date have been small to medium sized organizations that make purchasing decisions with limited interaction with our sales or other personnel; as we continue to focus on and become more dependent on sales to larger organizations and increase our investment in paid sources of qualified leads, we expect the percentage of qualified leads that come unpaid sources, such as organic search and customer referrals, to decrease and our sales cycles to lengthen and become less predictable.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of WAC. With the acquisition, we added technology that we anticipate will allow our customers to understand the ever-increasing diversity of data about their end customers. Over time, we expect this analytics software to become a core technology within our customer service platform, enabling us to further integrate data analytics capabilities across our products. We also expect to continue to sell our analytics software on a standalone basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our revenue was $208.8 million, $127.0 million, and $72.0 million, respectively, representing a 64% growth rate from 2014 to 2015 and 76% growth rate from 2013 to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 we derived $92.5 million, or 44%, $54.8 million, or 43%, and $29.6 million, or 41%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we generated net losses of $84.1 million, $67.4 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. We intend to invest aggressively to drive continued growth and market leadership.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depends on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business, or SMB, market, expand our enterprise customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected addition of new personnel and the investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including investments in additional capacity in data centers, leasehold improvements and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest in additional data center capacity and personnel to support our growth. The amount and timing of these investments will vary based on our estimates of projected growth. We also expect to continue to grow our customer support organization including expanding our product support and professional services teams. While we have moved significant portions of the hosting for our core platform to self-managed colocation data centers, improvements to our gross margin from such move have been partially offset by other hosting expenses, primarily related to the support of our platform infrastructure. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by utilizing capacity within our self-managed colocation data centers, efficient use of other hosting resources, and reducing the need for direct incremental personnel costs resulting from growth in our number of customers. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the future, although our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support team, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as amortization costs associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to introduce new products, broaden the functionality of our customer service platform, our live chat software, and our analytics software and to further integrate these products and services. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our enterprise customer base. We also expect to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts on our customer service platform and live chat software is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on our customer service platform, exclusive of our Starter plan, free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts using our live chat software, exclusive of free trials or other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier. Use of our customer service platform and live chat software requires separate subscriptions and each of these accounts are treated as separate paid customer account. Existing customers may also expand their utilization of our customer service platform or live chat software by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our customer service platform and live chat software to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. An increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our platform, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities. We do not currently incorporate accounts using our analytics software into determination of the number of paid customer accounts. We had approximately 69,100 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015, including approximately 35,700 paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and approximately 33,400 paid customer accounts using our live chat software. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline.\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we introduced our Essential plan for our customer service platform. This plan replaced our Starter plan as the least expensive paid plan on our customer service platform. Following the introduction of our Essential plan, we no longer made our Starter plan available for new accounts. Accounts that subscribe to our Essential plan are included in the determination of the number of paid customer accounts.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our customer service platform. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account on our customer service platform, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our customer service platform. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and upgrades in subscription plan, as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our live chat software or our analytics software into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our monthly recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our customer service platform. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any one-time discounts or any platform usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the paid customer accounts on our customer service platform as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving the transfer of agents between paid customer accounts, consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation results in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 32,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 35,700 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 123% as of December 31, 2015. We expect our dollar-based net expansion rate to decline over time as our aggregate monthly recurring revenue grows.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on our customer service platform and, to a lesser extent, live chat and analytics software. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each such user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans that vary in pricing based on functionality and, for our customer service platform, the type and amount of product support, and service-level commitments. Certain arrangements provide for unlimited usage for a fixed fee or incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Additionally, because of the mix of payment frequencies and contract lengths, we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful performance metric.\nWe derive an immaterial amount of revenue from implementation, voice usage, and training services, for which we recognize revenue upon completion.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, depreciation, hosting, and other expenses associated with our data centers, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, payment processing fees, third party license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, shared information technology and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nCurrently, we primarily operate out of four self-managed colocation data centers, in which we manage our own network equipment and systems, located in California, Virginia, Ireland, and Germany. Our live chat software was originally hosted in a managed hosting facility in Florida and in January 2015, we migrated all accounts to our self-managed colocation facility in Ireland. In addition, we utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia to support our platform infrastructure, for certain research and development purposes, and to host our analytics software. We intend to increase capacity in self-managed colocation data centers and/or with third-party managed hosting services over time to support our growth.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, through acquisitions and organically. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to incur ongoing capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capability of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software but also increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our products or for certain subscription plans, we expect third- party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such products and subscription plans to remain significant over time as we increase the number of customers using such products and subscription plans.\nGross Margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and costs associated with capitalized internal-use software. Although we expect that certain third- party technology license fees will remain significant, we expect these costs to decrease over time as we take steps necessary to secure long term access to such technology.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our products. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, commissions, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include online lead generation, advertising, promotional events, and public and community relations. Sales commissions and other incremental costs to acquire contracts are expensed as incurred.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our products, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of direct sales employees, developing our field sales and marketing teams, expanding our indirect sales channels, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services, and other corporate expenses and allocated shared costs.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, tax, and accounting services fees, insurance costs, board of directors' compensation and costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, executing significant transactions, including acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) and interest expense associated with our credit facility (terminated in June 2015), offset by interest income from marketable securities.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue:\n\n(1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows:\n\n\n (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nPrior to our IPO, we granted RSUs and certain stock options with both a service condition and a performance condition, or Performance Awards. The service condition for substantially all of the Performance Awards is satisfied over four years. The performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. No share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the Performance Awards prior to the IPO. Upon the satisfaction of the performance condition in May 2014, we recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense for the portion of the Performance Awards that had met the service condition, with the remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards was $6.1 million and $12.7 million, including $0.2 million and $0.9 million in cost of revenue, $4.3 million and $7.8 million in research and development, $1.0 million and $2.4 million in sales and marketing, and $0.6 million and $1.6 million in general and administrative expenses, respectively.\nRevenue\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Many of our existing customers to date have been small to medium sized organizations that make purchasing decisions with limited interaction with our sales or other personnel; as we continue to focus on and become more dependent on sales to larger organizations and increase our investment in paid sources of qualified leads, we expect the percentage of qualified leads that come unpaid sources, such as organic search and customer referrals, to decrease and our sales cycles to lengthen and become less predictable.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of WAC. With the acquisition, we added technology that we anticipate will allow our customers to understand the ever-increasing diversity of data about their end customers. Over time, we expect this analytics software to become a core technology within our customer service platform, enabling us to further integrate data analytics capabilities across our products. We also expect to continue to sell our analytics software on a standalone basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our revenue was $208.8 million, $127.0 million, and $72.0 million, respectively, representing a 64% growth rate from 2014 to 2015 and 76% growth rate from 2013 to 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 we derived $92.5 million, or 44%, $54.8 million, or 43%, and $29.6 million, or 41%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will decline as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we generated net losses of $84.1 million, $67.4 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. We intend to invest aggressively to drive continued growth and market leadership.\nThe growth of our business and our future success depends on many factors, including our ability to continue to innovate, maintain our leadership in the small and medium-sized business, or SMB, market, expand our enterprise customer base, and increase our global customer footprint. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will expand our operations and headcount in the near term. The expected addition of new personnel and the investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth, including investments in additional capacity in data centers, leasehold improvements and related fixed assets, will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest in additional data center capacity and personnel to support our growth. The amount and timing of these investments will vary based on our estimates of projected growth. We also expect to continue to grow our customer support organization including expanding our product support and professional services teams. While we have moved significant portions of the hosting for our core platform to self-managed colocation data centers, improvements to our gross margin from such move have been partially offset by other hosting expenses, primarily related to the support of our platform infrastructure. Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to gain economies of scale by utilizing capacity within our self-managed colocation data centers, efficient use of other hosting resources, and reducing the need for direct incremental personnel costs resulting from growth in our number of customers. As a result, we expect our gross margin to improve in the future, although our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support team, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as amortization costs associated with acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software.\nWe expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our software development efforts to introduce new products, broaden the functionality of our customer service platform, our live chat software, and our analytics software and to further integrate these products and services. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, particularly in connection with our efforts to expand our enterprise customer base. We also expect to incur additional general and administrative costs in order to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure required to comply with our obligations as a public company.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review a number of operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Paid Customer Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase our number of paid accounts on our customer service platform and live chat software is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We define the number of paid customer accounts as the sum of the number of accounts on our customer service platform, exclusive of our Starter plan, free trials or other free services, and the number of accounts using our live chat software, exclusive of free trials or other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier. Use of our customer service platform and live chat software requires separate subscriptions and each of these accounts are treated as separate paid customer account. Existing customers may also expand their utilization of our customer service platform or live chat software by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of our customer service platform and live chat software to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account. An increase in the number of paid customer accounts generally correlates to an increase in the number of authorized agents licensed to use our platform, which directly affects our revenue and results of operations. We view growth in this metric as a measure of our success in converting new sales opportunities. We do not currently incorporate accounts using our analytics software into determination of the number of paid customer accounts. We had approximately 69,100 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015, including approximately 35,700 paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and approximately 33,400 paid customer accounts using our live chat software. As the total number of paid customer accounts increases, we expect the rate of growth in the number of paid customer accounts to decline.\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we introduced our Essential plan for our customer service platform. This plan replaced our Starter plan as the least expensive paid plan on our customer service platform. Following the introduction of our Essential plan, we no longer made our Starter plan available for new accounts. Accounts that subscribe to our Essential plan are included in the determination of the number of paid customer accounts.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our customer service platform. We believe we can achieve this by focusing on delivering value and functionality that retains our existing customers, expands the number of authorized agents associated with an existing paid customer account on our customer service platform, and results in upgrades to higher-priced subscription plans. Maintaining customer relationships allows us to sustain and increase revenue to the extent customers maintain or increase the number of authorized agents licensed to use our customer service platform. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and upgrades in subscription plan, as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account on our customer service platform, and downgrades in subscription plans. We do not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with our live chat software or our analytics software into our measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon our monthly recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on our customer service platform. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue we expect to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any one-time discounts or any platform usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue or any other United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing our retained revenue net of contraction and churn by our base revenue. We define our base revenue as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the paid customer accounts on our customer service platform as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. We define our retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue of the same customer base included in our measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that we identify involving the transfer of agents between paid customer accounts, consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, our dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that is used to determine our base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation results in our dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 32,300 customers, as compared to the approximately 35,700 total paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2015. To the extent that we can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, we do not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining our dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, we believe the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew our dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts on our customer service platform and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate was 123% as of December 31, 2015. We expect our dollar-based net expansion rate to decline over time as our aggregate monthly recurring revenue grows.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription services, which are comprised of subscription fees from customer accounts on our customer service platform and, to a lesser extent, live chat and analytics software. Each subscription may have multiple authorized users, and we refer to each such user as an agent.\u201d The number of agents ranges from one to thousands for various customer accounts. Our pricing is generally established on a per agent basis. We offer a range of subscription account plans that vary in pricing based on functionality and, for our customer service platform, the type and amount of product support, and service-level commitments. Certain arrangements provide for unlimited usage for a fixed fee or incremental fees above a fixed maximum number of monthly agents during the subscription term. We sell subscription services under contractual agreements that vary in length, ranging between one month and multiple years, with the majority of subscriptions having a term of either one month or one year.\nSubscription fees are generally non-refundable regardless of the actual use of the service. Subscription revenue is typically affected by the number of customer accounts, number of agents, and the type of plan purchased by our customers, and is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our services are made available to our customers. Subscription services purchased online are typically paid for via a credit card on the date of purchase while subscription services purchased through our internal sales organization are generally billed with monthly, quarterly, or annual payment frequencies. Due to our mixed contract lengths and billing frequencies, the annualized value of the arrangements we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Additionally, because of the mix of payment frequencies and contract lengths, we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful performance metric.\nWe derive an immaterial amount of revenue from implementation, voice usage, and training services, for which we recognize revenue upon completion.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Margin, and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, depreciation, hosting, and other expenses associated with our data centers, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software, payment processing fees, third party license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, and allocated shared costs. We allocate shared costs such as facilities, shared information technology and security costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.\nCurrently, we primarily operate out of four self-managed colocation data centers, in which we manage our own network equipment and systems, located in California, Virginia, Ireland, and Germany. Our live chat software was originally hosted in a managed hosting facility in Florida and in January 2015, we migrated all accounts to our self-managed colocation facility in Ireland. In addition, we utilize third-party managed hosting facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia to support our platform infrastructure, for certain research and development purposes, and to host our analytics software. We intend to increase capacity in self-managed colocation data centers and/or with third-party managed hosting services over time to support our growth.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure, product support, and professional service organizations, through acquisitions and organically. We expect that recent and future business acquisitions will result in increased amortization expense of intangible assets such as acquired technology. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we expect to incur ongoing capitalized internal-use software costs and related amortization. We expect these investments in technology to not only expand the capability of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software but also increase the efficiency of how we deliver these services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. To the extent that we continue to rely on third-party technology to provide certain functionality within our products or for certain subscription plans, we expect third- party license fees for technology that is incorporated in such products and subscription plans to remain significant over time as we increase the number of customers using such products and subscription plans.\nGross Margin. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our product support and professional services teams, investments in additional personnel, equipment, and facilities to support our platform architecture, increased share-based compensation expenses, as well as the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and costs associated with capitalized internal-use software. Although we expect that certain third- party technology license fees will remain significant, we expect these costs to decrease over time as we take steps necessary to secure long term access to such technology.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our research and development organization and allocated shared costs.\nWe focus our research and development efforts on the continued development of our customer service platform, live chat software, and analytics software, including the development and deployment of new features and functionality and enhancements to our software architecture and integration across our products. We expect that, in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs (including salaries, commissions, share-based compensation, and benefits) for employees associated with our sales and marketing organizations, costs of marketing activities, and allocated shared costs. Marketing activities include online lead generation, advertising, promotional events, and public and community relations. Sales commissions and other incremental costs to acquire contracts are expensed as incurred.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our products, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing the number of direct sales employees, developing our field sales and marketing teams, expanding our indirect sales channels, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events, which we believe will enable us to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Because we do not have a long history of undertaking or growing many of these activities, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our revenue will increase as we invest in these strategies. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue over time may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits) for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for third-party professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services, and other corporate expenses and allocated shared costs.\nWe expect to incur incremental costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographic expansion, and the infrastructure required to be a public company. Such costs include increases in our finance, legal, and human resources personnel, additional legal, tax, and accounting services fees, insurance costs, board of directors' compensation and costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, executing significant transactions, including acquisitions, and other costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue in the long-term, although this may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. In particular, these expenses are sensitive to the impact of share-based compensation which may cause these expenses to fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) and interest expense associated with our credit facility (terminated in June 2015), offset by interest income from marketable securities.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following

The service condition for substantially all of the Performance Awards is satisfied over four years. The performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to our IPO. No share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the Performance Awards prior to the IPO. Upon the satisfaction of the performance condition in May 2014, we recognized a cumulative share-based compensation expense for the portion of the Performance Awards that had met the service condition, with the remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, share-based compensation expense related to the Performance Awards was $6.1 million and $12.7 million, including $0.2 million and $0.9 million in cost of revenue, $4.3 million and $7.8 million in research and development, $1.0 million and $2.4 million in sales and marketing, and $0.6 million and $1.6 million in general and administrative expenses, respectively.\nRevenue\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
