Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical aesthetics company uniquely centered on becoming the leader of transformative treatments and technologies focused on progressing the art of plastic surgery. We were founded to provide greater choices to board-certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants in the US. for augmentation procedures exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loyalty and confidence. In 2020, we also began to sell our breast implants in Japan through a distributor partner. We sell our breast tissue expanders for reconstruction procedures predominantly to hospitals and surgery centers, and our BIOCORNEUM scar management products to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other specialties.\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with miraDry (formerly Miramar Labs) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of miraDry's common stock. Pursuant to the transaction, which closed on July 25, 2017 we added the miraDry System, the only FDA-cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors to our aesthetics portfolio. Following our acquisition of miraDry in July 2017, we began selling the miraDry System, consisting of a console and a handheld device, and consumable single-use bioTips.\nAs a result of the miraDry acquisition, we determined that we will conduct our business in two operating segments: Breast Products and miraDry. The Breast Products segment focuses on sales of our breast implants, tissue expanders and scar management products. The miraDry segment focuses on sales of bioTips.\nWe sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 67 employees, including 8 sales managers. Additionally, we also sell our miraDry products in several international markets where we leverage distributor relationships supported by 6 sales representatives.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the non-essential healthcare industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and could lead to a global recession. We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, manufacturing, and employee-related amounts, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We continue to monitor and assess new information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets.\nAs an aesthetics company, surgical procedures involving our breast and miraDry products are susceptible to local and national government restrictions, such as social distancing, shelter in place\u201d orders and business closures, due to the economic and logistical impacts these measures have on consumer demand as well as the practitioners' ability to administer such procedures. The inability or limited ability to perform such non-emergency procedures significantly harmed our revenues during the second quarter of 2020 and continued to harm our revenues during the third and fourth quarter of 2020. While some states have lifted certain restrictions on non-emergency procedures, we will likely continue to experience future harm to our revenues while existing or new restrictions remain in place.\nFurther, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by governments. In addition, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that this can lead to a local and/or global economic recession, which may result in further harm to the aesthetics market. Such economic disruption could adversely affect our business. The continued spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and personnel. Further, trade and/or national security protection policies may be adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as actions by governments that limit, restrict or prevent the movement of certain goods into a country and/or region, and current U.S./China trade relations may be further exacerbated by the pandemic.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining the collectability of accounts receivable, fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill, and sales returns liability required could be impacted by the pandemic. While the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown at this time, we have made appropriate estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of our miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. salesforce and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nRestructuring\nOn November 6, 2019, we approved an organizational efficiency initiative, or the Plan, designed to reduce spending and simplify operations. Under the Plan, we implemented numerous initiatives to reduce spending, including closing the Santa Clara offices of miraDry, Inc. and consolidating a number of business support services via a shared services organization at our Santa Barbara headquarters. As of December 31, 2020, we have completed the Plan, incurred cumulative restructuring charges to date, and do not anticipate incurring restructuring charges in connection with this Plan in future periods.\nUnder the Plan, we reduced our workforce by terminating approximately 60 employees. As a result, we incurred total charges of $2.3 million in connection with one-time employee termination costs, retention costs and other benefits. In addition, we incurred $0.5 million related to duplicate operating costs and other associated costs. In total, the Plan incurred charges of $2.8 million, excluding non-cash charges.\nThe following table details the amount of the liabilities related to the Plan included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Severance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other associated costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Duplicate operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs charged to expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs paid or otherwise settled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,274\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details the charges by reportable segment, recorded in \"Restructuring\" under operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Breast Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> miraDry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe realized cost savings of approximately $10.0 million in 2020, which were all realized within operating expenses as a result from the reduction of headcount through a shared services organization. Due to the change in the miraDry business strategy announced in April 2020, we do not expect to realize any further cost savings in 2021 under the Plan.\nBreast Products Segment\nOur primary products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in approximately 350 variations of shapes, sizes, fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective procedures that are generally performed on a cash-pay basis. Many of our proprietary breast implants incorporate one or more technologies that differentiate us from our competitors, including High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel and shell microtexturing. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the silicone shell and High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our implants. The microtexturing on Sientra's implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture.\nOur breast implants were approved by the FDA in 2012, based on data we collected from our long-term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial is the largest prospective, long-term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and includes the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the long-term clinical trial are subject to serial MRI screenings as part of the clinical protocol. The clinical data we collected over a ten-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States. We have also commissioned a number of bench studies run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors.\nOn August 9, 2016, we announced our collaboration with Vesta Intermediate Funding, Inc., or Vesta, a Lubrizol Lifesciences company, pursuant to which we worked with Vesta to establish a dedicated manufacturing facility for our breast implants. On March 14, 2017, we announced that we had executed a definitive manufacturing agreement with Vesta for the manufacture and supply of our breast implants and that we had submitted a site-change pre-market approval, or PMA, supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta. Vesta began manufacturing our breast products in October 2017 in order to build our inventory pending FDA approval of the PMA supplement. On January 30, 2018, we announced that the FDA granted approval of the PMA supplement for our contract manufacturer, Vesta, to manufacture our silicone gel breast implants. In support of the move to the Vesta manufacturing facility, we also implemented new manufacturing process improvements which, in consultation with the FDA, required three (3) additional submissions. These submissions were approved by the FDA on January 10, 2018, January 19, 2018 and April 17, 2018. Further, on November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vesta pursuant to which we purchased certain assets and obtained a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, assignable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to certain intellectual property owned by Vesta, or the Vesta Acquisition. With this acquisition, we obtained full control of the Class 3 breast implant manufacturing operation previously owned and operated by Vesta, which we believe allows us to gain access to implement manufacturing efficiencies and improve our demand planning to ultimately reduce our manufacturing costs in the future.\nIn addition, we offer BIOCORNEUM, an advanced silicone scar treatment, directly to physicians and the AlloX2, and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, as well as the Softspan line of general tissue expanders.\nWe sell our breast implants for augmentation procedures exclusively to Plastic Surgeons, who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are predominantly sold to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings and a twenty year limited warranty that provides patients with cash reimbursement for certain out of pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event, a lifetime no charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures, and the industry's first policy of no charge replacement implants to patients who experience covered capsular contracture, double capsule and late-forming seroma events within twenty years of the initial implant procedure.\nmiraDry Segment\nIn July 2017, we completed our acquisition of miraDry, following which we began selling the miraDry System, the only FDA cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors through the precise and non-surgical delivery of microwave energy to the region where sweat glands reside. The energy generates heat at the dermal-fat interface which results in destruction of the sweat glands. At the same time, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the dermal-fat interface where the sweat glands reside. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting. Microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the dermal-fat interface where the glands reside.\nThe miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature, plus unwanted underarm hair removal, and permanent reduction of underarm hair of all colors for Fitzpatrick skin types I - IV. Permanent hair reduction is defined as long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing when measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after the completion of a treatment regime. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries.\nThe miraDry System provides patients with a non-surgical and durable procedure to selectively destroy underarm sweat glands for both severely hyperhidrotic patients and those that are bothered by their underarm sweat. The miraDry System is clinically proven to reduce sweat in one or more procedures of approximately 60-minutes, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with alternative treatment options. The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed\nthrough targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve their desired results.\nThe miraDry System consists of a console and a handheld device which uses consumable single-use bioTips. The miraDry procedure is not technique-dependent, does not require significant training or skill for the treatment provider, and the user-interface guides the provider through each step of the procedure for each treatment. We sell our miraDry System and consumable single-use bioTips only to physicians, consisting of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and physicians specializing in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Aesthetic specialists are physicians who elect to offer aesthetic procedures as a significant part of their practices but are generally not board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Physicians can market the miraDry procedure as a premium, highly-differentiated, non-surgical sweat reduction procedure. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of the miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. sales force and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nOur Breast Products segment net sales include sales of silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and BIOCORNEUM. We recognize revenue on breast implants and tissue expanders, net of sales discounts and estimated returns, as the customer has a standard six-month window to return purchased breast implants and tissue expanders. We defer the value of our service warranty revenue and recognize it once all performance obligations have been met.\nOur miraDry segment net sales include sales of the miraDry System and consumable bioTips along with service warranties. We recognize revenue on miraDry Systems and bioTips on delivery to the customer. We defer the value of our service warranty and recognize it over the term of the service warranty contract.\nWe expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures, the impact of the pandemic, and purchase of miraDry procedures. We believe that aesthetic procedures are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to patients planning their procedures leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\nCost of goods sold consists primarily of raw material, labor, overhead, and variable manufacturing costs, reserve for product assurance warranties, royalty costs, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and warehouse and other related costs.\nWith respect to our supplier contracts, all our products and raw materials are manufactured under contracts with fixed unit costs which can increase over time at specified amounts.\nUnder our Breast Products segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our silicone gel breast implants. Under our miraDry segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our miraDry Systems, and an assurance warranty on our handpieces and bioTips. The estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale. Costs related to our service warranty are recorded when expense is incurred related to meeting our performance obligations. In addition, the inventory fair market value associated with purchase accounting adjustments and royalty costs related to the SSP and miraDry acquisitions were recorded at the time of sale.\nWe expect our overall gross margin, which is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold for a given period divided by net sales, to fluctuate in future periods primarily as a result of quantity of units sold, manufacturing price increases, the changing mix of products sold with different gross margins, warranty costs, overhead costs and targeted pricing programs. Specific to the Breast Products segment, we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of increased unit cost of our gel implants following the Vesta Acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, consumer marketing, and travel for our sales, marketing and customer support personnel. Our sales and marketing expenses also include expenses for trade shows, our no-charge customer shipping program for the Breast Products segment and no-charge product evaluation units for the Breast Products segment, as well as educational and promotional activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses related to our Breast Products segment to fluctuate in future periods as a result of headcount and timing of our marketing programs. We expect our sales and marketing expense related to our miraDry segment to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative and as a result of the change in the miraDry business strategy.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development, or R&D, expenses primarily consist of clinical expenses, product development costs, regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside research activities, quality control and other costs associated with the development of our products and compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, requirements. R&D expenses also include related personnel and consultant compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred. We expect our R&D expenses to vary as different development projects are initiated, including improvements to our existing products, expansions of our existing product lines, new product acquisitions and our clinical studies.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative, or G&A, expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, and administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include contingent consideration fair market value adjustments, bad debt expense, outside legal counsel and litigation expenses, independent auditors and other outside consultants, corporate insurance, facilities and information technologies expenses.\nWe expect future G&A expenses to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative, but we also expect to continue to incur G&A expenses in connection with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, interest expense, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability and common stock warrants and amortization of issuance costs associated with our Credit Agreements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense consists of an estimate for income taxes based on the projected income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate in several tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. To date, we have incurred cumulative net losses and maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of such assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily through the sale and delivery of promised goods or services to customers. Sales prices are documented in the executed sales contract, purchase order or order acknowledgement prior to the transfer of control to the customer. Typical payment terms are 30 days for Breast Products and direct sales of consumable miraDry products, and tend to be longer for capital sales of miraDry Systems and sales to miraDry distributors, but do not extend beyond one year.\nOur revenue contracts may include multiple products or services, each of which is considered a separate performance obligation. Performance obligations typically include the delivery of promised products, such as breast implants, tissue expanders, BIOCORNEUM, miraDry Systems and bioTips, along with service-type warranties. Other deliverables are sometimes promised, but are ancillary and insignificant in the context of the contract as a whole. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling prices based on observable prices for all performance obligations with the exception of the service-type warranty under the Platinum20 Limited Warranty Program, or Platinum20.\nWe introduced Platinum20 in May 2018 on all OPUS breast implants implanted in the United States or Puerto Rico on or after May 1, 2018. Platinum20 provides for financial assistance for revision surgeries and no-charge contralateral replacement implants upon the occurrence of certain qualifying events. Platinum20 has an assurance warranty component and a service warranty component. The assurance component is recorded as a warranty liability at the time of sale. The service warranty component is considered an additional performance obligation and revenue is deferred at the time of sale using the expected cost plus margin approach for the performance obligation. Inputs into the expected cost plus margin approach include historical incidence rates, estimated replacement costs, estimated financial assistance payouts and an estimated margin.\nThe liability for unsatisfied performance obligations under the service warranty as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions and adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,115\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue for service warranties are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements. Specifically for Platinum20, the performance obligation is satisfied at the time that the benefits are provided and are expected to be satisfied over the following 3 to 24 month period for financial assistance and 20 years for product replacement.\nFor delivery of promised products, control transfers and revenue is recognized upon shipment, unless the contractual arrangement requires transfer of control when products reach their destination, for which revenue is recognized once the product arrives at its destination. A portion of our revenue is generated from the sale of consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at doctor, hospital, and clinic locations. For these products, revenue is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been implanted, not when the consigned products are delivered to the customer's location.\nWe also leverage a distributor network for selling the miraDry System internationally. We recognize revenue when control of the goods or services is transferred to the distributors. Standard terms in these agreements do not allow for trial periods, right of return, refunds, payment contingent on obtaining financing or other terms that could impact the customer's payment obligation. Contract liabilities are included in accrued and other current liabilities\u201d in the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Return Liability\nFor Breast Products, with the exception of the Company's BIOCORNEUM scar management products, we allow for the return of products from customers within six months after the original sale, which is accounted for as variable consideration. A sales return liability is established based on estimated sales returns using relevant historical experience taking into consideration recent gross sales and notifications of pending returns, as adjusted for changes in recent industry events and trends. The estimated sales return is recorded as a reduction of revenue and as a sales return liability in the same period revenue is recognized. Actual sales returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates. If actual sales returns differ significantly from the estimates, an adjustment to revenue in the current or subsequent period would be recorded. The following table provides a rollforward of the sales return liability (in thousands):\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Addition to reserve for sales activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (117,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,148\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in estimate of sales returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPractical Expedients and Policy Election\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nWe do not adjust accounts receivable for the effects of any significant financing components as customer payment terms are shorter than one year.\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the products as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the products to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are largely provided to customers free of charge for the Breast Products segment. The associated costs were $2.9 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are viewed as part of our marketing programs and are recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations as an accounting policy election. For the miraDry segment, shipping and handling charges are typically billed to customers and recorded as revenue. The shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations. The associated costs were $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that goodwill may be impaired. Our annual test for impairment is performed as of October 1 of each fiscal year, pursuant to which we make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. After the acquisition of miraDry, management began evaluating the Company as two reporting units: Breast Products and miraDry.\nThe fair value analysis of goodwill utilizes the income approach and market approach, which requires the use of estimates about a reporting unit's future revenues and free cash flows, market multiples, enterprise value, control risk premiums, discount rates, terminal value and enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value. Our future revenues and free cash flow assumptions are determined based upon actual results giving effect to management's expected changes in operating results in future years. Our market multiples, enterprise value, control risk premiums, discount rates and terminal value are based upon market participant assumptions using a defined peer group. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect these estimates. Thus, to the extent the market changes, discount rates increase significantly or we do not meet our projected performance, we could recognize impairments, and such impairments could be material.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, the Company noted a decline in actual and forecasted earnings for the miraDry reporting unit in comparison to forecasted earnings determined in prior periods. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the carrying value of the miraDry reporting unit more likely than not exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount.\nAfter performing the impairment test as of June 30, 2019 the Company determined that the carrying value of its miraDry reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value using the income approach, as described above, by an amount that indicated a full impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. Consequently, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $7.6 million during the second quarter ended June 30, 2019, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn the current year, we performed a qualitative analysis for the remaining Breast Products reporting unit on the annual goodwill impairment test on October 1, 2020. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its carrying value and did not record any goodwill impairment charges.\nWarranty Reserve\nWe offer a product replacement and limited warranty program for our silicone gel breast implants, and a product warranty for the our miraDry Systems and consumable bioTips, which we consider to be assurance-type warranties. For silicone get breast implant surgeries occurring prior to May 1, 2018, we provide lifetime replacement implants and up to $3,600 in financial assistance for revision surgeries, for covered rupture events that occur within ten years of the surgery date. We introduced our Platinum20 Limited Warranty Program in May 2018, covering OPUS silicone get breast implants implanted in the United States or Puerto Rico on or after May 1, 2018. We consider Platinum20 to have a service warranty component and an assurance warranty component. The service warranty component as an additional performance obligation and defer revenue at the time of sale based on the relative estimated selling price as detailed under Revenue Recognition above. The assurance component is recorded as a warranty liability at the time of sale and is related to the lifetime no-charge contralateral replacement implants and up to $5,000 in financial assistance for revision surgeries, for covered rupture events that occur within twenty years of the surgery date. Under the miraDry warranty, we provide a standard product warranty for the miraDry System and bioTips. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held total warranty liabilities of $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation using a fair-value based method for costs related to all employee share-based payments, including stock options, restricted stock units, and the employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant date fair value of a stock-based award is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period of the award on a straight-line basis. In addition, we use the Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value of market-based awards. The Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however, it also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.\nThe Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models require inputs of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and expected term, among other inputs. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe recorded total non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million, $12.5 million and $13.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options of $2.1 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had total unrecognized compensation costs of $11.5 million related to unvested restricted stock units, or RSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.88 years.\nThe following table represents stock-based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Goods Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value, with limited exceptions. Valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis. The most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset, including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory, economic and other factors. Each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nWe believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions. However, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. We will finalize these amounts as we obtain the information necessary to complete the measurement processes. Any changes resulting from facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates may result in adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition dates. We finalize these amounts no later than one year from the respective acquisition dates.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Useful life is the period over which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. We determine the useful lives of intangible assets based on a number of factors, such as legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life, and the effects of obsolescence, anticipated demand, existence or absence of competition, and other economic factors on useful life.\nDeferred and liability-classified contingent consideration associated with a business combination is initially recognized at fair value and then remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in general and administrative expense. We use the Monte-Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration, which requires input assumptions about the likelihood of achieving specified milestone criteria, projections of future financial performance, and assumed discount rates. Changes in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations result from several factors including changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving specified milestone criteria. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our contingent consideration fair value expense could be materially different in the future. Equity-classified contingent consideration associated with a business combination is recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date and are not subsequently remeasured each reporting period unless the obligation becomes reclassified as a liability. The subsequent settlement of the obligation is accounted for within equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on recent accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Net sales of our Breast Products segment increased $8.6 million to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in the volume of sales of gel implants. Net sales of our miraDry segment decreased $21.1 million to $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by an overall decrease in the volume of sales of miraDry systems and consumable bioTips due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change in miraDry business strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our sales organization included 67 U.S. employees, as compared to 103 employees, including 93 U.S. employees and 10 international employees as of December 31, 2019. The reduction in the number of sales employees is due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change in miraDry business strategy.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\nCost of goods sold decreased $0.7 million, or 2.2%, to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in the miraDry segment, offset by an increase in sales volume and unit costs of breast implants in the Breast Products segment.\nThe gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 54.7% and 60.6%, respectively. The decrease was due to increased unit cost of gel implants in the Breast Products segment following the Vesta Acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $27.6 million, or 34.5%, to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in employee payroll and incentive compensation related expenses, and a reduction in consulting fees and marketing events and initiatives associated with the organizational efficiency initiative, the change in the miraDry business strategy and other cost saving measures implemented in response to COVID-19.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased $3.2 million, or 23.8%, to $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in employee payroll and incentive compensation related expenses associated with the organizational efficiency initiative, the change in the miraDry business strategy and other cost saving measures implemented in response to COVID-19, coupled with decreases in costs related to clinical and regulatory activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nG&A expenses decreased $8.6 million, or 18.3%, to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily related to decreases in consulting expenses, employee payroll and incentive compensation related expenses, legal expenses associated with the organizational efficiency initiative, the change in the miraDry business strategy and other cost saving measures implemented in response to COVID-19. In addition, there were decreases in intangibles amortization expense, fair value adjustments, and acquisition costs, offset by increases in expenses related to severance, bad debt, and insurance.\nRestructuring Expenses\nRestructuring expenses increased $0.7 million, or 62.7% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in severance expenses of employees affected by the organizational efficiency initiative.\nImpairment\nImpairment expenses were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of the impairment of the remaining miraDry intangible assets. Impairment expenses were $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of impairment of goodwill for the miraDry reporting unit and partial impairment of miraDry intangible assets.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in the fair value of the derivative liability, interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our Credit Agreements and Convertible Note.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $33,000 as compared to income tax expense of $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses and anticipate that our losses will continue in the near term. We expect our operating expenses will continue to decrease with the change in the miraDry business strategy, but we will need to generate significant net sales to achieve profitability. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock, borrowings under our term loans and convertible note, sales of our products since 2012, and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in public offerings.\nDebt financing\nOn July 25, 2017, we entered into the Existing Credit Agreements with Midcap. On July 1, 2019, we entered into certain credit agreements with Midcap Financial Trust pursuant to which we repaid our existing indebtedness under our Existing Credit Agreements and the outstanding commitment fee was cancelled. Further, on May 11, 2020 and February 5, 2021, we amended certain credit agreements with Midcap Financial Trust.\nOn March 11, 2020, we entered into a facility agreement with Deerfield Partners, L.P., issuing $60.0 million in principal amount of 4.0% unsecured and subordinated convertible notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in the facility agreement.\nIn April 2020, we were granted a loan of $6.7 million under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, or the PPP Loan, all or a portion of which may be forgiven dependent on our use of proceeds. The PPP Loan matures on April 20, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven upon submission of documentation of expenditures in accordance with certain specified requirements. We sought and obtained the PPP Loan due to the immediate and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues and prospects. The PPP Loan has allowed us to satisfy our payroll obligations without a material reduction in pay for our employees or a material headcount reduction, other than the reductions in the previously announced organizational efficiency initiative.\nDue to the continued uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues may continue to be adversely impacted. If we are unable to achieve certain revenue targets, we may breach certain financial covenants set forth in our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial Trust. If we breach these covenants, MidCap will have the right to accelerate repayment of the outstanding amounts. In addition, a breach of a financial covenant in the Credit Agreement would result in a cross default under our convertible note with Deerfield, which would allow Deerfield to accelerate repayment of the amounts owed, subject to certain restrictions. In the event that either MidCap or Deerfield accelerates the repayment of our indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy such obligations and our business operations may be materially harmed.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of our long-term debt, revolving line of credit, convertible note, and PPP loan.\nEquity financing\nIn February 2018, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, or Stifel, as sales agent pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, through Stifel, shares of common stock having an aggregate gross offering price of up to $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 37,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the sales agreement.\nOn May 7, 2018, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering in which we sold 7,407,408 shares of common stock at $13.50 per share, as well as 1,111,111 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. Net proceeds were approximately $107.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million.\nFurther, on June 7, 2019, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering of 17,391,305 shares of common stock at $5.75 per share, as well as 2,608,695 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. Net proceeds were approximately $107.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $55.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with research and development activities, activities relating to commercialization and increases in working capital. In addition, we have used cash to fund the acquisitions of miraDry, BIOCORNEUM, Vesta, and the tissue expander portfolio.\nTo fund our ongoing operating and capital needs, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital. We believe we have sufficient capital resources to continue as a going concern through the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (87,033\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,037\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,014\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,641\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.1 million and $87.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $26.9 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily associated with a $16.9 million decrease in net loss, increases in fair value adjustments to the derivative liability, the provision for doubtful accounts and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, along with a slight increase in the change to working capital, offset by decreases in impairment and stock-based compensation.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.0 million and $22.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to cash paid for the Vesta Acquisition in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020.\nCash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $31.5 million and $109.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $78.3 million was primarily the result of a decrease in the proceeds from issuance of common stock, repayments of the term loan, and decrease in borrowings under the revolving loan, offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of the convertible note and the PPP loan.\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to a number of factors. For example, our cash inflow and outflow may be impacted by the following:\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our implant manufacturing facility in Franklin, Wisconsin to meet capacity to meet customer requirements and maintain unit costs that will drive gross margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability of our third-party tissue expander manufacturing facility operated by SiMatrix to meet capacity to meet customer requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> net sales generated by our Breast Products and miraDry segments, and any other future products that we may develop and commercialize;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs associated with expanding our sales force and marketing programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cost associated with developing and commercializing our proposed products or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses we incur in connection with potential litigation or governmental investigations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearance or approval for our current or future products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cost of ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, including compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> anticipated or unanticipated capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> unanticipated G&A expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> support of our sales and marketing efforts related to our current and future products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> new product acquisition and development efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities expansion needs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment in inventory required to meet customer demands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short-term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our particular short-term cash uses or the timing or amount of cash used.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical aesthetics company uniquely centered on becoming the leader of transformative treatments and technologies focused on progressing the art of plastic surgery. We were founded to provide greater choices to board-certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants in the US. for augmentation procedures exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loyalty and confidence. In 2020, we also began to sell our breast implants in Japan through a distributor partner. We sell our breast tissue expanders for reconstruction procedures predominantly to hospitals and surgery centers, and our BIOCORNEUM scar management products to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other specialties.\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with miraDry (formerly Miramar Labs) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of miraDry's common stock. Pursuant to the transaction, which closed on July 25, 2017 we added the miraDry System, the only FDA-cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors to our aesthetics portfolio. Following our acquisition of miraDry in July 2017, we began selling the miraDry System, consisting of a console and a handheld device, and consumable single-use bioTips.\nAs a result of the miraDry acquisition, we determined that we will conduct our business in two operating segments: Breast Products and miraDry. The Breast Products segment focuses on sales of our breast implants, tissue expanders and scar management products. The miraDry segment focuses on sales of bioTips.\nWe sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 67 employees, including 8 sales managers. Additionally, we also sell our miraDry products in several international markets where we leverage distributor relationships supported by 6 sales representatives.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the non-essential healthcare industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and could lead to a global recession. We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, manufacturing, and employee-related amounts, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We continue to monitor and assess new information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets.\nAs an aesthetics company, surgical procedures involving our breast and miraDry products are susceptible to local and national government restrictions, such as social distancing, shelter in place\u201d orders and business closures, due to the economic and logistical impacts these measures have on consumer demand as well as the practitioners' ability to administer such procedures. The inability or limited ability to perform such non-emergency procedures significantly harmed our revenues during the second quarter of 2020 and continued to harm our revenues during the third and fourth quarter of 2020. While some states have lifted certain restrictions on non-emergency procedures, we will likely continue to experience future harm to our revenues while existing or new restrictions remain in place.\nFurther, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by governments. In addition, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that this can lead to a local and/or global economic recession, which may result in further harm to the aesthetics market. Such economic disruption could adversely affect our business. The continued spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and personnel. Further, trade and/or national security protection policies may be adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as actions by governments that limit, restrict or prevent the movement of certain goods into a country and/or region, and current U.S./China trade relations may be further exacerbated by the pandemic.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining the collectability of accounts receivable, fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill, and sales returns liability required could be impacted by the pandemic. While the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown at this time, we have made appropriate estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of our miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. salesforce and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nRestructuring\nOn November 6, 2019, we approved an organizational efficiency initiative, or the Plan, designed to reduce spending and simplify operations. Under the Plan, we implemented numerous initiatives to reduce spending, including closing the Santa Clara offices of miraDry, Inc. and consolidating a number of business support services via a shared services organization at our Santa Barbara headquarters. As of December 31, 2020, we have completed the Plan, incurred cumulative restructuring charges to date, and do not anticipate incurring restructuring charges in connection with this Plan in future periods.\nUnder the Plan, we reduced our workforce by terminating approximately 60 employees. As a result, we incurred total charges of $2.3 million in connection with one-time employee termination costs, retention costs and other benefits. In addition, we incurred $0.5 million related to duplicate operating costs and other associated costs. In total, the Plan incurred charges of $2.8 million, excluding non-cash charges.\nThe following table details the amount of the liabilities related to the Plan included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table details the charges by reportable segment, recorded in \"Restructuring\" under operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n\nWe realized cost savings of approximately $10.0 million in 2020, which were all realized within operating expenses as a result from the reduction of headcount through a shared services organization. Due to the change in the miraDry business strategy announced in April 2020, we do not expect to realize any further cost savings in 2021 under the Plan.\nBreast Products Segment\nOur primary products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in approximately 350 variations of shapes, sizes, fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective procedures that are generally performed on a cash-pay basis. Many of our proprietary breast implants incorporate one or more technologies that differentiate us from our competitors, including High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel and shell microtexturing. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the silicone shell and High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our implants. The microtexturing on Sientra's implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture.\nOur breast implants were approved by the FDA in 2012, based on data we collected from our long-term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial is the largest prospective, long-term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and includes the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the long-term clinical trial are subject to serial MRI screenings as part of the clinical protocol. The clinical data we collected over a ten-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States. We have also commissioned a number of bench studies run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors.\nOn August 9, 2016, we announced our collaboration with Vesta Intermediate Funding, Inc., or Vesta, a Lubrizol Lifesciences company, pursuant to which we worked with Vesta to establish a dedicated manufacturing facility for our breast implants. On March 14, 2017, we announced that we had executed a definitive manufacturing agreement with Vesta for the manufacture and supply of our breast implants and that we had submitted a site-change pre-market approval, or PMA, supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta. Vesta began manufacturing our breast products in October 2017 in order to build our inventory pending FDA approval of the PMA supplement. On January 30, 2018, we announced that the FDA granted approval of the PMA supplement for our contract manufacturer, Vesta, to manufacture our silicone gel breast implants. In support of the move to the Vesta manufacturing facility, we also implemented new manufacturing process improvements which, in consultation with the FDA, required three (3) additional submissions. These submissions were approved by the FDA on January 10, 2018, January 19, 2018 and April 17, 2018. Further, on November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vesta pursuant to which we purchased certain assets and obtained a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, assignable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to certain intellectual property owned by Vesta, or the Vesta Acquisition. With this acquisition, we obtained full control of the Class 3 breast implant manufacturing operation previously owned and operated by Vesta, which we believe allows us to gain access to implement manufacturing efficiencies and improve our demand planning to ultimately reduce our manufacturing costs in the future.\nIn addition, we offer BIOCORNEUM, an advanced silicone scar treatment, directly to physicians and the AlloX2, and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, as well as the Softspan line of general tissue expanders.\nWe sell our breast implants for augmentation procedures exclusively to Plastic Surgeons, who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are predominantly sold to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings and a twenty year limited warranty that provides patients with cash reimbursement for certain out of pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event, a lifetime no charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures, and the industry's first policy of no charge replacement implants to patients who experience covered capsular contracture, double capsule and late-forming seroma events within twenty years of the initial implant procedure.\nmiraDry Segment\nIn July 2017, we completed our acquisition of miraDry, following which we began selling the miraDry System, the only FDA cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors through the precise and non-surgical delivery of microwave energy to the region where sweat glands reside. The energy generates heat at the dermal-fat interface which results in destruction of the sweat glands. At the same time, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the dermal-fat interface where the sweat glands reside. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting. Microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the dermal-fat interface where the glands reside.\nThe miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature, plus unwanted underarm hair removal, and permanent reduction of underarm hair of all colors for Fitzpatrick skin types I - IV. Permanent hair reduction is defined as long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing when measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after the completion of a treatment regime. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries.\nThe miraDry System provides patients with a non-surgical and durable procedure to selectively destroy underarm sweat glands for both severely hyperhidrotic patients and those that are bothered by their underarm sweat. The miraDry System is clinically proven to reduce sweat in one or more procedures of approximately 60-minutes, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with alternative treatment options. The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed\nthrough targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve their desired results.\nThe miraDry System consists of a console and a handheld device which uses consumable single-use bioTips. The miraDry procedure is not technique-dependent, does not require significant training or skill for the treatment provider, and the user-interface guides the provider through each step of the procedure for each treatment. We sell our miraDry System and consumable single-use bioTips only to physicians, consisting of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and physicians specializing in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Aesthetic specialists are physicians who elect to offer aesthetic procedures as a significant part of their practices but are generally not board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Physicians can market the miraDry procedure as a premium, highly-differentiated, non-surgical sweat reduction procedure. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of the miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. sales force and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nOur Breast Products segment net sales include sales of silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and BIOCORNEUM. We recognize revenue on breast implants and tissue expanders, net of sales discounts and estimated returns, as the customer has a standard six-month window to return purchased breast implants and tissue expanders. We defer the value of our service warranty revenue and recognize it once all performance obligations have been met.\nOur miraDry segment net sales include sales of the miraDry System and consumable bioTips along with service warranties. We recognize revenue on miraDry Systems and bioTips on delivery to the customer. We defer the value of our service warranty and recognize it over the term of the service warranty contract.\nWe expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures, the impact of the pandemic, and purchase of miraDry procedures. We believe that aesthetic procedures are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to patients planning their procedures leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\nCost of goods sold consists primarily of raw material, labor, overhead, and variable manufacturing costs, reserve for product assurance warranties, royalty costs, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and warehouse and other related costs.\nWith respect to our supplier contracts, all our products and raw materials are manufactured under contracts with fixed unit costs which can increase over time at specified amounts.\nUnder our Breast Products segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our silicone gel breast implants. Under our miraDry segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our miraDry Systems, and an assurance warranty on our handpieces and bioTips. The estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale. Costs related to our service warranty are recorded when expense is incurred related to meeting our performance obligations. In addition, the inventory fair market value associated with purchase accounting adjustments and royalty costs related to the SSP and miraDry acquisitions were recorded at the time of sale.\nWe expect our overall gross margin, which is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold for a given period divided by net sales, to fluctuate in future periods primarily as a result of quantity of units sold, manufacturing price increases, the changing mix of products sold with different gross margins, warranty costs, overhead costs and targeted pricing programs. Specific to the Breast Products segment, we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of increased unit cost of our gel implants following the Vesta Acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, consumer marketing, and travel for our sales, marketing and customer support personnel. Our sales and marketing expenses also include expenses for trade shows, our no-charge customer shipping program for the Breast Products segment and no-charge product evaluation units for the Breast Products segment, as well as educational and promotional activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses related to our Breast Products segment to fluctuate in future periods as a result of headcount and timing of our marketing programs. We expect our sales and marketing expense related to our miraDry segment to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative and as a result of the change in the miraDry business strategy.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development, or R&D, expenses primarily consist of clinical expenses, product development costs, regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside research activities, quality control and other costs associated with the development of our products and compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, requirements. R&D expenses also include related personnel and consultant compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred. We expect our R&D expenses to vary as different development projects are initiated, including improvements to our existing products, expansions of our existing product lines, new product acquisitions and our clinical studies.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative, or G&A, expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, and administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include contingent consideration fair market value adjustments, bad debt expense, outside legal counsel and litigation expenses, independent auditors and other outside consultants, corporate insurance, facilities and information technologies expenses.\nWe expect future G&A expenses to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative, but we also expect to continue to incur G&A expenses in connection with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, interest expense, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability and common stock warrants and amortization of issuance costs associated with our Credit Agreements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense consists of an estimate for income taxes based on the projected income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate in several tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. To date, we have incurred cumulative net losses and maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of such assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily through the sale and delivery of promised goods or services to customers. Sales prices are documented in the executed sales contract, purchase order or order acknowledgement prior to the transfer of control to the customer. Typical payment terms are 30 days for Breast Products and direct sales of consumable miraDry products, and tend to be longer for capital sales of miraDry Systems and sales to miraDry distributors, but do not extend beyond one year.\nOur revenue contracts may include multiple products or services, each of which is considered a separate performance obligation. Performance obligations typically include the delivery of promised products, such as breast implants, tissue expanders, BIOCORNEUM, miraDry Systems and bioTips, along with service-type warranties. Other deliverables are sometimes promised, but are ancillary and insignificant in the context of the contract as a whole. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling prices based on observable prices for all performance obligations with the exception of the service-type warranty under the Platinum20 Limited Warranty Program, or Platinum20.\nWe introduced Platinum20 in May 2018 on all OPUS breast implants implanted in the United States or Puerto Rico on or after May 1, 2018. Platinum20 provides for financial assistance for revision surgeries and no-charge contralateral replacement implants upon the occurrence of certain qualifying events. Platinum20 has an assurance warranty component and a service warranty component. The assurance component is recorded as a warranty liability at the time of sale. The service warranty component is considered an additional performance obligation and revenue is deferred at the time of sale using the expected cost plus margin approach for the performance obligation. Inputs into the expected cost plus margin approach include historical incidence rates, estimated replacement costs, estimated financial assistance payouts and an estimated margin.\nThe liability for unsatisfied performance obligations under the service warranty as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nRevenue for service warranties are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements. Specifically for Platinum20, the performance obligation is satisfied at the time that the benefits are provided and are expected to be satisfied over the following 3 to 24 month period for financial assistance and 20 years for product replacement.\nFor delivery of promised products, control transfers and revenue is recognized upon shipment, unless the contractual arrangement requires transfer of control when products reach their destination, for which revenue is recognized once the product arrives at its destination. A portion of our revenue is generated from the sale of consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at doctor, hospital, and clinic locations. For these products, revenue is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been implanted, not when the consigned products are delivered to the customer's location.\nWe also leverage a distributor network for selling the miraDry System internationally. We recognize revenue when control of the goods or services is transferred to the distributors. Standard terms in these agreements do not allow for trial periods, right of return, refunds, payment contingent on obtaining financing or other terms that could impact the customer's payment obligation. Contract liabilities are included in accrued and other current liabilities\u201d in the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Return Liability\nFor Breast Products, with the exception of the Company's BIOCORNEUM scar management products, we allow for the return of products from customers within six months after the original sale, which is accounted for as variable consideration. A sales return liability is established based on estimated sales returns using relevant historical experience taking into consideration recent gross sales and notifications of pending returns, as adjusted for changes in recent industry events and trends. The estimated sales return is recorded as a reduction of revenue and as a sales return liability in the same period revenue is recognized. Actual sales returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates. If actual sales returns differ significantly from the estimates, an adjustment to revenue in the current or subsequent period would be recorded. The following table provides a rollforward of the sales return liability (in thousands):\n\nPractical Expedients and Policy Election\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nWe do not adjust accounts receivable for the effects of any significant financing components as customer payment terms are shorter than one year.\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the products as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the products to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are largely provided to customers free of charge for the Breast Products segment. The associated costs were $2.9 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are viewed as part of our marketing programs and are recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations as an accounting policy election. For the miraDry segment, shipping and handling charges are typically billed to customers and recorded as revenue. The shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations. The associated costs were $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead subject to impairment tests on", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical aesthetics company uniquely centered on becoming the leader of transformative treatments and technologies focused on progressing the art of plastic surgery. We were founded to provide greater choices to board-certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants in the US. for augmentation procedures exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loyalty and confidence. In 2020, we also began to sell our breast implants in Japan through a distributor partner. We sell our breast tissue expanders for reconstruction procedures predominantly to hospitals and surgery centers, and our BIOCORNEUM scar management products to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other specialties.\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with miraDry (formerly Miramar Labs) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of miraDry's common stock. Pursuant to the transaction, which closed on July 25, 2017 we added the miraDry System, the only FDA-cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors to our aesthetics portfolio. Following our acquisition of miraDry in July 2017, we began selling the miraDry System, consisting of a console and a handheld device, and consumable single-use bioTips.\nAs a result of the miraDry acquisition, we determined that we will conduct our business in two operating segments: Breast Products and miraDry. The Breast Products segment focuses on sales of our breast implants, tissue expanders and scar management products. The miraDry segment focuses on sales of bioTips.\nWe sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 67 employees, including 8 sales managers. Additionally, we also sell our miraDry products in several international markets where we leverage distributor relationships supported by 6 sales representatives.\nRecent developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the non-essential healthcare industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and could lead to a global recession. We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, manufacturing, and employee-related amounts, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We continue to monitor and assess new information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets.\nAs an aesthetics company, surgical procedures involving our breast and miraDry products are susceptible to local and national government restrictions, such as social distancing, shelter in place\u201d orders and business closures, due to the economic and logistical impacts these measures have on consumer demand as well as the practitioners' ability to administer such procedures. The inability or limited ability to perform such non-emergency procedures significantly harmed our revenues during the second quarter of 2020 and continued to harm our revenues during the third and fourth quarter of 2020. While some states have lifted certain restrictions on non-emergency procedures, we will likely continue to experience future harm to our revenues while existing or new restrictions remain in place.\nFurther, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by governments. In addition, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that this can lead to a local and/or global economic recession, which may result in further harm to the aesthetics market. Such economic disruption could adversely affect our business. The continued spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and personnel. Further, trade and/or national security protection policies may be adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as actions by governments that limit, restrict or prevent the movement of certain goods into a country and/or region, and current U.S./China trade relations may be further exacerbated by the pandemic.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining the collectability of accounts receivable, fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill, and sales returns liability required could be impacted by the pandemic. While the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown at this time, we have made appropriate estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of our miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. salesforce and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nRestructuring\nOn November 6, 2019, we approved an organizational efficiency initiative, or the Plan, designed to reduce spending and simplify operations. Under the Plan, we implemented numerous initiatives to reduce spending, including closing the Santa Clara offices of miraDry, Inc. and consolidating a number of business support services via a shared services organization at our Santa Barbara headquarters. As of December 31, 2020, we have completed the Plan, incurred cumulative restructuring charges to date, and do not anticipate incurring restructuring charges in connection with this Plan in future periods.\nUnder the Plan, we reduced our workforce by terminating approximately 60 employees. As a result, we incurred total charges of $2.3 million in connection with one-time employee termination costs, retention costs and other benefits. In addition, we incurred $0.5 million related to duplicate operating costs and other associated costs. In total, the Plan incurred charges of $2.8 million, excluding non-cash charges.\nThe following table details the amount of the liabilities related to the Plan included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Severance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other associated costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Duplicate operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs charged to expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs paid or otherwise settled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,274\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details the charges by reportable segment, recorded in \"Restructuring\" under operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cumulative Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Breast Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> miraDry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe realized cost savings of approximately $10.0 million in 2020, which were all realized within operating expenses as a result from the reduction of headcount through a shared services organization. Due to the change in the miraDry business strategy announced in April 2020, we do not expect to realize any further cost savings in 2021 under the Plan.\nBreast Products Segment\nOur primary products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in approximately 350 variations of shapes, sizes, fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective procedures that are generally performed on a cash-pay basis. Many of our proprietary breast implants incorporate one or more technologies that differentiate us from our competitors, including High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel and shell microtexturing. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the silicone shell and High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our implants. The microtexturing on Sientra's implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture.\nOur breast implants were approved by the FDA in 2012, based on data we collected from our long-term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial is the largest prospective, long-term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and includes the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the long-term clinical trial are subject to serial MRI screenings as part of the clinical protocol. The clinical data we collected over a ten-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States. We have also commissioned a number of bench studies run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors.\nOn August 9, 2016, we announced our collaboration with Vesta Intermediate Funding, Inc., or Vesta, a Lubrizol Lifesciences company, pursuant to which we worked with Vesta to establish a dedicated manufacturing facility for our breast implants. On March 14, 2017, we announced that we had executed a definitive manufacturing agreement with Vesta for the manufacture and supply of our breast implants and that we had submitted a site-change pre-market approval, or PMA, supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta. Vesta began manufacturing our breast products in October 2017 in order to build our inventory pending FDA approval of the PMA supplement. On January 30, 2018, we announced that the FDA granted approval of the PMA supplement for our contract manufacturer, Vesta, to manufacture our silicone gel breast implants. In support of the move to the Vesta manufacturing facility, we also implemented new manufacturing process improvements which, in consultation with the FDA, required three (3) additional submissions. These submissions were approved by the FDA on January 10, 2018, January 19, 2018 and April 17, 2018. Further, on November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vesta pursuant to which we purchased certain assets and obtained a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, assignable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to certain intellectual property owned by Vesta, or the Vesta Acquisition. With this acquisition, we obtained full control of the Class 3 breast implant manufacturing operation previously owned and operated by Vesta, which we believe allows us to gain access to implement manufacturing efficiencies and improve our demand planning to ultimately reduce our manufacturing costs in the future.\nIn addition, we offer BIOCORNEUM, an advanced silicone scar treatment, directly to physicians and the AlloX2, and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, as well as the Softspan line of general tissue expanders.\nWe sell our breast implants for augmentation procedures exclusively to Plastic Surgeons, who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are predominantly sold to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings and a twenty year limited warranty that provides patients with cash reimbursement for certain out of pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event, a lifetime no charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures, and the industry's first policy of no charge replacement implants to patients who experience covered capsular contracture, double capsule and late-forming seroma events within twenty years of the initial implant procedure.\nmiraDry Segment\nIn July 2017, we completed our acquisition of miraDry, following which we began selling the miraDry System, the only FDA cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors through the precise and non-surgical delivery of microwave energy to the region where sweat glands reside. The energy generates heat at the dermal-fat interface which results in destruction of the sweat glands. At the same time, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the dermal-fat interface where the sweat glands reside. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting. Microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the dermal-fat interface where the glands reside.\nThe miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature, plus unwanted underarm hair removal, and permanent reduction of underarm hair of all colors for Fitzpatrick skin types I - IV. Permanent hair reduction is defined as long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing when measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after the completion of a treatment regime. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries.\nThe miraDry System provides patients with a non-surgical and durable procedure to selectively destroy underarm sweat glands for both severely hyperhidrotic patients and those that are bothered by their underarm sweat. The miraDry System is clinically proven to reduce sweat in one or more procedures of approximately 60-minutes, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with alternative treatment options. The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed\nthrough targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve their desired results.\nThe miraDry System consists of a console and a handheld device which uses consumable single-use bioTips. The miraDry procedure is not technique-dependent, does not require significant training or skill for the treatment provider, and the user-interface guides the provider through each step of the procedure for each treatment. We sell our miraDry System and consumable single-use bioTips only to physicians, consisting of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and physicians specializing in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Aesthetic specialists are physicians who elect to offer aesthetic procedures as a significant part of their practices but are generally not board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Physicians can market the miraDry procedure as a premium, highly-differentiated, non-surgical sweat reduction procedure. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.\nChange in miraDry business strategy\nIn April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of the miraDry segment's net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. sales force and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Sales\nOur Breast Products segment net sales include sales of silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and BIOCORNEUM. We recognize revenue on breast implants and tissue expanders, net of sales discounts and estimated returns, as the customer has a standard six-month window to return purchased breast implants and tissue expanders. We defer the value of our service warranty revenue and recognize it once all performance obligations have been met.\nOur miraDry segment net sales include sales of the miraDry System and consumable bioTips along with service warranties. We recognize revenue on miraDry Systems and bioTips on delivery to the customer. We defer the value of our service warranty and recognize it over the term of the service warranty contract.\nWe expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures, the impact of the pandemic, and purchase of miraDry procedures. We believe that aesthetic procedures are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to patients planning their procedures leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\nCost of goods sold consists primarily of raw material, labor, overhead, and variable manufacturing costs, reserve for product assurance warranties, royalty costs, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, and warehouse and other related costs.\nWith respect to our supplier contracts, all our products and raw materials are manufactured under contracts with fixed unit costs which can increase over time at specified amounts.\nUnder our Breast Products segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our silicone gel breast implants. Under our miraDry segment, we provide an assurance and service warranty on our miraDry Systems, and an assurance warranty on our handpieces and bioTips. The estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale. Costs related to our service warranty are recorded when expense is incurred related to meeting our performance obligations. In addition, the inventory fair market value associated with purchase accounting adjustments and royalty costs related to the SSP and miraDry acquisitions were recorded at the time of sale.\nWe expect our overall gross margin, which is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold for a given period divided by net sales, to fluctuate in future periods primarily as a result of quantity of units sold, manufacturing price increases, the changing mix of products sold with different gross margins, warranty costs, overhead costs and targeted pricing programs. Specific to the Breast Products segment, we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of increased unit cost of our gel implants following the Vesta Acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, consumer marketing, and travel for our sales, marketing and customer support personnel. Our sales and marketing expenses also include expenses for trade shows, our no-charge customer shipping program for the Breast Products segment and no-charge product evaluation units for the Breast Products segment, as well as educational and promotional activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses related to our Breast Products segment to fluctuate in future periods as a result of headcount and timing of our marketing programs. We expect our sales and marketing expense related to our miraDry segment to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative and as a result of the change in the miraDry business strategy.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development, or R&D, expenses primarily consist of clinical expenses, product development costs, regulatory expenses, consulting services, outside research activities, quality control and other costs associated with the development of our products and compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, requirements. R&D expenses also include related personnel and consultant compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense R&D costs as they are incurred. We expect our R&D expenses to vary as different development projects are initiated, including improvements to our existing products, expansions of our existing product lines, new product acquisitions and our clinical studies.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative, or G&A, expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, and administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include contingent consideration fair market value adjustments, bad debt expense, outside legal counsel and litigation expenses, independent auditors and other outside consultants, corporate insurance, facilities and information technologies expenses.\nWe expect future G&A expenses to decrease as we have implemented the organizational efficiency initiative, but we also expect to continue to incur G&A expenses in connection with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income, interest expense, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability and common stock warrants and amortization of issuance costs associated with our Credit Agreements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense consists of an estimate for income taxes based on the projected income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate in several tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. To date, we have incurred cumulative net losses and maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of such assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily through the sale and delivery of promised goods or services to customers. Sales prices are documented in the executed sales contract, purchase order or order acknowledgement prior to the transfer of control to the customer. Typical payment terms are 30 days for Breast Products and direct sales of consumable miraDry products, and tend to be longer for capital sales of miraDry Systems and sales to miraDry distributors, but do not extend beyond one year.\nOur revenue contracts may include multiple products or services, each of which is considered a separate performance obligation. Performance obligations typically include the delivery of promised products, such as breast implants, tissue expanders, BIOCORNEUM, miraDry Systems and bioTips, along with service-type warranties. Other deliverables are sometimes promised, but are ancillary and insignificant in the context of the contract as a whole. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling prices based on observable prices for all performance obligations with the exception of the service-type warranty under the Platinum20 Limited Warranty Program, or Platinum20.\nWe introduced Platinum20 in May 2018 on all OPUS breast implants implanted in the United States or Puerto Rico on or after May 1, 2018. Platinum20 provides for financial assistance for revision surgeries and no-charge contralateral replacement implants upon the occurrence of certain qualifying events. Platinum20 has an assurance warranty component and a service warranty component. The assurance component is recorded as a warranty liability at the time of sale. The service warranty component is considered an additional performance obligation and revenue is deferred at the time of sale using the expected cost plus margin approach for the performance obligation. Inputs into the expected cost plus margin approach include historical incidence rates, estimated replacement costs, estimated financial assistance payouts and an estimated margin.\nThe liability for unsatisfied performance obligations under the service warranty as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions and adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,115\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue for service warranties are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements. Specifically for Platinum20, the performance obligation is satisfied at the time that the benefits are provided and are expected to be satisfied over the following 3 to 24 month period for financial assistance and 20 years for product replacement.\nFor delivery of promised products, control transfers and revenue is recognized upon shipment, unless the contractual arrangement requires transfer of control when products reach their destination, for which revenue is recognized once the product arrives at its destination. A portion of our revenue is generated from the sale of consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at doctor, hospital, and clinic locations. For these products, revenue is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been implanted, not when the consigned products are delivered to the customer's location.\nWe also leverage a distributor network for selling the miraDry System internationally. We recognize revenue when control of the goods or services is transferred to the distributors. Standard terms in these agreements do not allow for trial periods, right of return, refunds, payment contingent on obtaining financing or other terms that could impact the customer's payment obligation. Contract liabilities are included in accrued and other current liabilities\u201d in the consolidated balance sheet.\nSales Return Liability\nFor Breast Products, with the exception of the Company's BIOCORNEUM scar management products, we allow for the return of products from customers within six months after the original sale, which is accounted for as variable consideration. A sales return liability is established based on estimated sales returns using relevant historical experience taking into consideration recent gross sales and notifications of pending returns, as adjusted for changes in recent industry events and trends. The estimated sales return is recorded as a reduction of revenue and as a sales return liability in the same period revenue is recognized. Actual sales returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates. If actual sales returns differ significantly from the estimates, an adjustment to revenue in the current or subsequent period would be recorded. The following table provides a rollforward of the sales return liability (in thousands):\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Addition to reserve for sales activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (117,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,148\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in estimate of sales returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPractical Expedients and Policy Election\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nWe do not adjust accounts receivable for the effects of any significant financing components as customer payment terms are shorter than one year.\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the products as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the products to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are largely provided to customers free of charge for the Breast Products segment. The associated costs were $2.9 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are viewed as part of our marketing programs and are recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations as an accounting policy election. For the miraDry segment, shipping and handling charges are typically billed to customers and recorded as revenue. The shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations. The associated costs were $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead subject to impairment tests on"}
