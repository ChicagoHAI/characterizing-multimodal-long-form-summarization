Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe following management's discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the Company's results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, information about our business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors, and the transactions that underlie our financial results, which are included in various parts of this filing. Our website address is www.callon.com. All of our filings with the SEC are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. Information on our website does not form part of this report on Form 10-K.\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. We are focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore, oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico and is comprised of three primary sub-basins: the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin, and the Central Basin Platform. We have historically been focused on the Midland Basin and more recently entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017. Our operating culture is centered on responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, safety and the environment, which we believe strengthens our operational performance. Our drilling activity is predominantly focused on the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and the Lower Spraberry shales. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through working interest acquisitions, leasing programs, acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps. Our production was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2017, our net acreage position in the Permian Basin was 57,481 net acres.\nSignificant accomplishments for 2017 include:\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased annual production in 2017 by 50% to 8,373 MBOE as compared to 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased 2017 proved reserves by 50% to 137 MMBOE as compared to 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017, acquiring approximately 29,175 gross (16,688 net) acres;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to a four rig horizontal drilling program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperational Highlights\nAll of our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin. As a result of our acquisition and horizontal development efforts, our production grew 50% in 2017 compared to 2016, increasing to 8,373 MBOE from 5,573 MBOE. Our production in 2017 was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas.\nIn 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to four rig horizontal drilling program. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we drilled 49 gross (38.2 net) horizontal wells, completed 52 gross (41.4 net) horizontal wells and had four gross (2.0 net) horizontal wells awaiting completion.\nReserve Growth\nAs of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved reserves increased 50% to 137.0 MMBOE compared to 91.6 MMBOE of estimated net proved reserves at year-end 2016. Our significant growth in proved reserves was primarily attributable to our horizontal development and acquisition efforts. Our proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 were 78% oil and 22% natural gas for both periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of capital have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial institutions, the sale of debt and equity securities, and asset dispositions. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties, in addition to refinancing of debt instruments.\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, we issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes to raise additional capital. In addition, we amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity. We continue to evaluate other sources of capital to complement our cash flow from operations and other sources of capital as we pursue our long-term growth plans.

The total notional amount available under the Company's Credit Facility is $2,000 million. Concurrent with the execution of the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility's borrowing base increased to $650 million, but the Company elected an aggregate commitment amount of $500 million. On November 7, 2017, the Credit Facility's borrowing base increased to $700 million with a reaffirmed commitment of $500 million, following the semi-annual review. As of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a balance of $25 million outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.11%, calculated as the LIBOR plus a tiered rate ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%, which is determined based on utilization of the facility. In addition, the Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the borrowing base.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Credit Facility.\n6.125% Senior Notes\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes with a maturity date of October 1, 2024 and interest payable semi-annually beginning on April 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $391.3 million. The 6.125% Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating Company, and may be guaranteed by certain future subsidiaries.\nOn May 19, 2017, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes which with the existing $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture.\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net proceeds of the offering, including a premium issue price of 104.125% and after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $206.1 million.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes.\n10% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock\u201d)\nHolders of the Company's Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 10.0% per annum of the $50.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to $5.00 per annum per share). Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Preferred Stock dividends were $7.3 million in 2017.\nThe Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other mandatory redemption. On or after May 30, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by paying $50.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nOn February 4, 2016, the Company exchanged a total of 120,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 719,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 1,458,948 shares of its Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\nSee Note 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Preferred Stock.\n2018 Capital Plan and Outlook\nOur operational capital budget for 2018 has been established in the range of $500 to $540 million on an accrual, or GAAP, basis, inclusive of a planned transition from a four rig program that commenced in July 2017 to a five rig program by mid-February 2018.\nAs part of our 2018 operated horizontal drilling program, we expect to place 43 to 46 net horizontal wells on production with lateral lengths ranging from 5,000' to 10,000'.\n\u0eff\nIn addition to the operational capital expenditures budget, which includes well costs, facilities and infrastructure capital, and surface land purchases, we budgeted an estimated $23 to $28 million for capitalized general and administrative expenses on an accrual, or GAAP, basis.\nOur revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices we receive for, and our ability to develop our reserves of oil and natural gas. We believe the long-term outlook for our business is favorable due to our resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. We monitor current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and our liquidity needs and may adjust our capital investment plan accordingly.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table includes the Company's current contractual obligations and purchase commitments (in thousands):\n\u0eff\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.125% Senior Notes (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other fees related to debt commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling rig leases (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office space lease and other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes the outstanding principal amount only.

The NYMEX price for natural gas ranged from a low of $2.56 per MMBtu to a high of $3.42 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOil revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, oil revenues of $322 million increased $145 million, or 81%, compared to revenues of $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production and an 18% increase in the average realized sales price, which rose to $49.16 per Bbl from $41.51 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 2,125 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,191 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, oil revenues of $178 million increased $52.5 million, or 42%, compared to revenues of $125 million for the same period of 2015. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production offset by an 8% decrease in the average realized sales price, which fell to $41.51 per Bbl from $44.88 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 1,182 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 547 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenue (including NGLs)\nNatural gas revenues of $44.1 million increased $20.9 million, or 90%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily relates to a 40% increase in natural gas volumes and a 35% increase in the average price realized, which rose to $4.05 per Mcf from $2.99 per Mcf, reflecting increases in both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase in production was comprised of 1,969 MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,375 MMcf attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenues of $23.2 million increased $10.9 million, or 88%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $12.3 million for the same period of 2015. The increase primarily relates to an 80% increase in natural gas volumes and a 5% increase in the average price realized, which rose to $2.99 per Mcf from $2.86 per Mcf, reflecting increases in both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase in production was comprised of 1,387 MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,025 MMcf attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. In addition, the increase in production was also attributable to the increase in the percentage of natural gas produced in our production stream.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

These are daily costs incurred to extract oil and natural gas and maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include maintenance, repairs, gas treating fees, salt water disposal, insurance and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.\nLOE for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 30% to $49.9 million compared to $38.4 million for the same period of 2016. Contributing to the increase was $11.0 million related to oil and natural gas properties acquired during 2016 and 2017 (see Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for information about the Company's acquisitions). LOE per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $5.96 per BOE compared to $6.88 per BOE for the same period of 2016, which was primarily attributable to higher production volumes resulting from an increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions as discussed above.\nLOE for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by 42% to $38.4 million compared to $27.0 million for the same period of 2015. Contributing to the increase for the current period was $7.3 million related to oil and natural gas properties acquired during 2016 (see Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for information about the Company's acquisitions). Excluding LOE related to these acquired properties, LOE increased by $4.0 million, or 15%, compared to the same period of 2015. LOE per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to $6.88 per BOE compared to $7.71 per BOE for the same period of 2015, which was primarily attributable to higher production volumes offset by an increase in cost from workover activity on our legacy properties. The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions as discussed above.\nProduction taxes. Production taxes include severance and ad valorem taxes. In general, production taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, severance taxes are based upon current year commodity prices, whereas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices. Severance taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Where available, we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In the counties where our production is located, we are also subject to ad valorem taxes, which are generally based on the taxing jurisdictions' valuation of our oil and gas properties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, production taxes increased 89%, or $10.5 million, to $22.4 million compared to $11.9 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in severance taxes, which was attributable to the increase in revenue. The increase was also attributable to an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher valuation of our oil and gas properties by\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe taxing jurisdictions due to an increased number of producing wells as a result of our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions. On a per BOE basis, production taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 25% compared to the same period of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, production taxes increased 21%, or $2.1 million, to $11.9 million compared to $9.8 million for the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in severance taxes, which was attributable to the increase in revenue. The increase was offset by a decrease in ad valorem taxes attributable to a lower valuation of our oil and gas properties by the taxing jurisdictions. On a per BOE basis, production taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by 24% compared to the same period of 2015.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d). Under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units-of-production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. We calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unevaluated properties, less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. Depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, DD&A increased 62% to $115.7 million from $71.4 million compared to the same period of 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to a 50% increase in production and an 8% increase in our per BOE DD&A rate. The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, DD&A on a per unit basis increased to $13.82 per BOE compared to $12.81 per BOE for the same period of 2016. The increase is attributable to our increase in our depreciable base and assumed future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves relative to our increased estimated proved reserves as a result of additions made through our horizontal drilling efforts and acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, DD&A increased 3% to $71.4 million from $69.2 million compared to the same period of 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a 59% increase in production, offset by a 35% decrease in our per BOE DD&A rate. The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, DD&A on a per unit basis decreased to $12.81 per BOE compared to $19.74 per BOE for the same period of 2015. The decrease is attributable to our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable base and assumed future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves as a result of additions made through our horizontal drilling efforts and acquisitions, offset by the write-down of oil and natural gas properties in the first half of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative, net of amounts capitalized ( G&A\u201d). These are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, severance and early retirement expenses, costs of maintaining offices, managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, depreciation of corporate level assets, public company costs, vesting of equity and liability awards under share-based compensation plans and related mark-to-market valuation adjustments over time, fees for audit and other professional services, and legal compliance.\nG&A for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $27.1 million compared to $26.3 million for the same period of 2016.

In June 2017, the Company settled the outstanding share-based award agreements of its former Chief Executive Officer, resulting in $6.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Settled share-based awards.\nAccretion expense. The Company is required to record the estimated fair value of liabilities for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated ARO costs. Interest is accreted on the present value of the ARO and reported as accretion expense within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAccretion expense related to our ARO decreased 29% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Accretion expense generally correlates with the Company's ARO, which was $6.0 million at December 31, 2017 versus $6.7 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 12 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's ARO.\nAccretion expense related to our ARO increased 45% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Accretion expense generally correlates with the Company's ARO, which was $6.7 million at December 31, 2016 versus $5.1 million at December 31, 2015. See Note 12 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's ARO.\nWrite-down of oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost ceiling amount). These rules require pricing based on the preceding 12-months' average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized no write-down of oil and natural gas properties as a result of the ceiling test limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a write-down of oil and natural gas properties of $95.8 million as a result of the ceiling test limitation, primarily driven by a 15% decrease in the 12-month average realized price of oil from $50.16 per barrel as of December 31, 2015 to $42.75 per barrel as of December 31, 2016. If commodity prices were to decline, we could incur additional ceiling test write-downs in the future. See Notes 2 and 13 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nRig termination fee. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized $3.1 million in expense related to the early termination of the contract for its vertical rig. See Note 14 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition expense.

In addition, we include the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized amounts, incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $9.7 million to $2.2 million compared to $11.9 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $13.9 million increase in capitalized interest compared to the 2016 period, resulting from a higher average unevaluated property balance for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016. The increase in unevaluated property was primarily due to acquired properties (see Note 3 and 13 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for information about the Company's acquisitions and unevaluated property balance). Offsetting the decrease was a $5.2 million increase in interest expense related to our debt due to a higher average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, resulting from the issuance of an additional $200 million of our 6.125% Senior Notes in May 2017 (see Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes).\nInterest expense, net of capitalized amounts, incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $9.2 million to $11.9 million compared to $21.1 million for the same period of 2015.

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. When appropriate based on our analysis, we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company had an income tax expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of less than $0.1 million for the same period of 2016. The change in income tax is primarily related to deferred state income tax expense. The effective tax rate differed from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the valuation allowance for the comparative periods, the effect of state taxes, and non-deductible executive compensation expenses.\nThe Company had an income tax benefit of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $38.5 million for the same period of 2015. The change in income tax is primarily related to recording a valuation allowance of $108.8 in 2015 and the difference in the amount of income (loss) before income taxes between periods. The effective tax rate of 0% in 2016 and (19)% in 2015 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the valuation allowance for the comparative periods, the effect of state taxes, and non-deductible executive compensation expenses.\nTable 303: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rates to the effective tax rates:\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of income tax rate reconciliation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense computed at the statutory federal income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State taxes net of federal benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted stock and stock options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Section 162(m)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information, see Note 11 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements.\nPreferred stock dividends.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under GAAP. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. See Note 2 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.\nOil and natural gas properties\nThe Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties whereby all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves, including certain overhead costs, are capitalized into the full cost pool.\u201d The amounts capitalized into the full cost pool are depleted (charged against earnings) using the unit-of-production method. The full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties requires that the Company makes estimates based on its assumptions of future events that could change. These estimates are described below.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of oil and natural gas properties\nThe Company calculates DD&A by using the depletable base, which is equal to the net capitalized costs in our full cost pool plus estimated future development costs, and the estimated net proved reserve quantities. Capitalized costs added to the full cost pool include the following:\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, acquisition costs of properties with proved reserves, delay rentals and other costs related to exploration and development of our oil and natural gas properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payroll costs including the related fringe benefits paid to employees directly engaged in the acquisition, exploration and/or development of oil and natural gas properties as well as other directly identifiable general and administrative costs associated with such activities.

These unevaluated property costs are added to the depletable base at such time as wells are completed on the properties or management determines these costs have been impaired.

The Company uses assumptions based on the latest geologic, engineering, regulatory and cost data available to it to estimate these amounts. However, the estimates made are subjective and may change over time. The Company's estimates of future development costs are reviewed at least annually and as additional information becomes available; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capitalized costs included in the full cost pool plus estimated future development costs are depleted and charged against earnings using the unit-of-production method. Under this method, the Company estimates the proved reserves quantities at the beginning of each accounting period. For each BOE produced during the period, the Company records a DD&A charge equal to the amount included in the depletable base (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization) divided by our estimated net proved reserve quantities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause the Company uses estimates and assumptions to determine proved reserves (as discussed below) and the amounts included in the depletable base, our depletion rates may materially change if actual results differ from these estimates.\nCeiling test\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, the Company compares, at the end of each financial reporting period, the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs and the value of commodity derivative instruments) plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties net of related deferred taxes. The Company refers to this comparison as a ceiling test.\u201d If the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceed the estimated discounted (at a 10% annualized rate) future net cash flows from\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nproved reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, the Company is required to write-down the value of its oil and natural gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on a twelve-month average pricing assumption. Given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Company's estimates of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term. For the periods ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized no write-down of oil and natural gas properties as a result of the ceiling test limitation. For the periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized write-downs of oil and natural gas properties of $95.8 million and $208.4 million, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test limitation. If oil and natural gas prices were to decline, even if only for a short period of time, we could incur additional write-downs of oil and natural gas properties in the future. See Notes 2 and 13 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's oil and natural gas properties.\nThe table below presents the cumulative results of the full cost ceiling test along with various pricing scenarios to demonstrate the sensitivity of our full cost ceiling and estimated total proved reserve volumes to changes in 12-month average oil and natural gas prices on closing prices on the first day of each month. This sensitivity analysis is as of December 31, 2017 and, accordingly, does not consider drilling results, production, changes in oil and natural gas prices, and changes in future development and operating costs subsequent to December 31, 2017 that may require revisions to our proved reserve estimates and resulting estimated future net cash flows used in the full cost ceiling test. The volumes resulting from the sensitivity analysis, which are for illustrative purposes only, incorporate a number of assumptions and have not been audited by the Company's third-party engineer.\n\u0eff\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12-Month Average Prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Excess (Deficit) of\nFull Cost Ceiling Over Net Capitalized Costs\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing Scenarios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oil ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural gas ($/Mcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined price sensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil and natural gas +10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>501,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil and natural gas -10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,719\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil price sensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil +10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil -10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas sensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas +10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas -10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimating reserves and present value of estimated future net cash flows\nEstimates of quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including the discounted present value of estimated future net cash flows from such reserves at the end of each quarter, are based on numerous assumptions, which are likely to change over time. These assumptions include:\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the prices at which the Company can sell its oil and natural gas production in the future. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, but we are required to assume that they remain constant, using the twelve-month average pricing assumption. In general, higher oil and natural gas prices will increase quantities of proved reserves and the present value of estimated future net cash flows from such reserves, while lower prices will decrease these amounts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs to develop and produce the Company's reserves and the costs to dismantle its production facilities when reserves are depleted. These costs are likely to change over time, but we are required to assume that they remain constant. Increases in costs will reduce estimated oil and natural gas quantities and the present value of estimated future net cash flows, while decreases in costs will increase such amounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in these prices and/or costs will affect the present value of estimated future net cash flows more than the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves for the Company's properties that have relatively short productive lives. If oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or decline further, it will have a negative impact on the present value of estimated future net cash flows and the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves.\nIn addition, the process of estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves requires that the Company's independent and internal reserve engineers exercise judgment based on available geological, geophysical and technical information. We have described the risks associated with reserve estimation and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices under Risk Factors.\u201d\nSales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnproved properties\nCosts, including capitalized interest, associated with properties that do not have proved reserves are excluded from the depletable base, and are included in the line item Unevaluated properties.\u201d Unevaluated property costs are transferred to the depletable base when wells are completed on the properties or management determines that these costs have been impaired. In addition, the Company is required to determine whether its unevaluated properties are impaired and, if so, include the costs of such properties in the depletable base. We assess properties on an individual basis or as a group. The Company considers the following factors, among others: exploration program and intent to drill, remaining lease term, and the assignment of proved reserves. This determination may require the exercise of substantial judgment by management.\nAsset retirement obligations\nWe are required to record our estimate of the fair value of liabilities for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-life assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells and related facilities, the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of the asset retirement obligation. Interest is accreted on the present value of the asset retirement obligations and reported as accretion expense within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to evaluated properties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEstimating the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells and related facilities is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\nSee Note 12 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nDerivatives\nTo manage oil and natural gas price risk on a portion of our planned future production, we have historically utilized commodity derivative instruments (including collars, swaps, put and call options and other structures) on approximately 40% to 60% of our projected production volumes in any given year. We do not use these instruments for trading purposes. Settlements of derivative contracts are generally based on the difference between the contract price and prices specified in the derivative instrument and a NYMEX price or other cash or futures index price.\nOur derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The estimated fair value of our derivative contracts is based upon current forward market prices on NYMEX and in the case of collars and floors, the time value of options.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe following management's discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the Company's results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, information about our business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors, and the transactions that underlie our financial results, which are included in various parts of this filing. Our website address is www.callon.com. All of our filings with the SEC are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. Information on our website does not form part of this report on Form 10-K.\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. We are focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore, oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico and is comprised of three primary sub-basins: the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin, and the Central Basin Platform. We have historically been focused on the Midland Basin and more recently entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017. Our operating culture is centered on responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, safety and the environment, which we believe strengthens our operational performance. Our drilling activity is predominantly focused on the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and the Lower Spraberry shales. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through working interest acquisitions, leasing programs, acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps. Our production was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2017, our net acreage position in the Permian Basin was 57,481 net acres.\nSignificant accomplishments for 2017 include:\n \u2022 Increased annual production in 2017 by 50% to 8,373 MBOE as compared to 2016; \n \u2022 Increased 2017 proved reserves by 50% to 137 MMBOE as compared to 2016; \n \u2022 Entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017, acquiring approximately 29,175 gross (16,688 net) acres; \n \u2022 In 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to a four rig horizontal drilling program. \n \u2022 Issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes; and \n \u2022 Amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity. \nOperational Highlights\nAll of our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin. As a result of our acquisition and horizontal development efforts, our production grew 50% in 2017 compared to 2016, increasing to 8,373 MBOE from 5,573 MBOE. Our production in 2017 was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas.\nIn 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to four rig horizontal drilling program. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we drilled 49 gross (38.2 net) horizontal wells, completed 52 gross (41.4 net) horizontal wells and had four gross (2.0 net) horizontal wells awaiting completion.\nReserve Growth\nAs of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved reserves increased 50% to 137.0 MMBOE compared to 91.6 MMBOE of estimated net proved reserves at year-end 2016. Our significant growth in proved reserves was primarily attributable to our horizontal development and acquisition efforts. Our proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 were 78% oil and 22% natural gas for both periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of capital have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial institutions, the sale of debt and equity securities, and asset dispositions. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties, in addition to refinancing of debt instruments.\n\nIn 2017, we issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes to raise additional capital. In addition, we amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity. We continue to evaluate other sources of capital to complement our cash flow from operations and other sources of capital as we pursue our long-term growth plans. See Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents decreased $625.0 million to $28.0 million compared to $653.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and cash flow\n\nOperating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $229.9 million, compared to $120.8 million for the same period in 2016. The change in operating activities was predominantly attributable to the following:\n \u2022 An increase in revenue; \n \u2022 A decrease in settlements of derivative contracts; \n \u2022 An increase in certain operating expenses related to acquired properties; \n \u2022 An increase in payments in cash-settled restricted stock unit ( RSU\u201d) awards; and \n \u2022 A change related to the timing of working capital payments and receipts. \nProduction, realized prices, and operating expenses are discussed below in Results of Operations. See Notes 6 and 7 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the components of the Company's derivative contracts and disclosures related to derivative instruments including their composition and valuation. See Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for more information on the Company's acquisitions.\nInvesting activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $1,072.5 million compared to $866.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 A $229.8 million increase in operational expenditures primarily due to our transition from a one-rig program in 2016 to a four-rig program in 2017. In August 2016, we transitioned from a one-rig program to a two-rig program. We transitioned from a two-rig program to a three-rig program in January 2017 and from a three-rig program to a four-rig program in July 2017; and \n \u2022 A $23.6 million decrease in acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sale of mineral interest and equipment. \nOur investing activities, on a cash basis, include the following for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\u0eff\n\n (a) On an accrual (GAAP) basis, which is the methodology used for establishing our annual capital budget, operational expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $392.7 million. Inclusive of capitalized general and administrative expenses and capitalized interest expenses, total capital expenditures were $463.2 million. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses and capitalized interest are discussed below in Results of Operations. See Notes 3 and 14 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information on significant acquisitions and drilling rig leases.\nFinancing activities. We finance a portion of our capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, term debt and equity offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $217.6 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,397.3 million during the same period of 2016. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 A decrease in proceeds resulting from common stock offerings. In 2016, we raised $1,357.6 million through four common stock offerings as compared no common stock offerings in 2017; and \n \u2022 A $188.2 million decrease in borrowings on fixed rate debt. In 2016, we issued a $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes, and in 2017, we issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount, including a premium issue price of 104.125%, of the 6.125% Senior Notes. \nNet cash provided by financing activities includes the following for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\u0eff\n\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's debt. See Note 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's equity offerings and Series A 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock.\nCredit Facility\nOn May 31, 2017, the Company entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to the Credit Facility with a maturity date of May 25, 2022. The total notional amount available under the Company's Credit Facility is $2,000 million. Concurrent with the execution of the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility's borrowing base increased to $650 million, but the Company elected an aggregate commitment amount of $500 million. On November 7, 2017, the Credit Facility's borrowing base increased to $700 million with a reaffirmed commitment of $500 million, following the semi-annual review. As of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a balance of $25 million outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.11%, calculated as the LIBOR plus a tiered rate ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%, which is determined based on utilization of the facility. In addition, the Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the borrowing base.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Credit Facility.\n6.125% Senior Notes\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes with a maturity date of October 1, 2024 and interest payable semi-annually beginning on April 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $391.3 million. The 6.125% Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating Company, and may be guaranteed by certain future subsidiaries.\nOn May 19, 2017, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes which with the existing $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture.\n\nThe net proceeds of the offering, including a premium issue price of 104.125% and after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $206.1 million.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes.\n10% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock\u201d)\nHolders of the Company's Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 10.0% per annum of the $50.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to $5.00 per annum per share). Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Preferred Stock dividends were $7.3 million in 2017.\nThe Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other mandatory redemption. On or after May 30, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by paying $50.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nOn February 4, 2016, the Company exchanged a total of 120,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 719,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 1,458,948 shares of its Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\nSee Note 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Preferred Stock.\n2018 Capital Plan and Outlook\nOur operational capital budget for 2018 has been established in the range of $500 to $540 million on an accrual, or GAAP, basis, inclusive of a planned transition from a four rig program that commenced in July 2017 to a five rig program by mid-February 2018.\nAs part of our 2018 operated horizontal drilling program, we expect to place 43 to 46 net horizontal wells on production with lateral lengths ranging from 5,000' to 10,000'.\n\u0eff\nIn addition to the operational capital expenditures budget, which includes well costs, facilities and infrastructure capital, and surface land purchases, we budgeted an estimated $23 to $28 million for capitalized general and administrative expenses on an accrual, or GAAP, basis.\nOur revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices we receive for, and our ability to develop our reserves of oil and natural gas. We believe the long-term outlook for our business is favorable due to our resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. We monitor current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and our liquidity needs and may adjust our capital investment plan accordingly.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table includes the Company's current contractual obligations and purchase commitments (in thousands):\n\u0eff\n\n (a) Includes the outstanding principal amount only. The 6.125% Senior Notes have a maturity date of October 1, 2024. See Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes. \n (b) As of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a $25 million balance outstanding. We cannot predict the timing of future borrowings and repayments. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 25, 2022. See Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Credit Facility. \n\n (c) Includes estimated cash payments on the 6.125% Senior Notes and Credit Facility and the minimum amount of commitment fees due on the Credit Facility. \n (d) Drilling rig leases represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services under contracts to which the Company was a party on December 31, 2017. The value in the table represents the gross amount that we are committed to pay. However, we will record our proportionate share based on our working interest in our consolidated financial statements as incurred. See Note 14 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's drilling rig leases. \n (e) Amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. See Note 12 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to the Company's oil and natural gas operations for the periods indicated: \u0eff \n (a) Excludes the impact of cash settled derivatives. \n (b) Excludes gathering and treating expense. \nRevenues\nThe following tables are intended to reconcile the change in oil, natural gas and total revenue for the respective periods presented by reflecting the effect of changes in volume and in the underlying commodity prices. \n\nCommodity Prices\nThe prices for oil and natural gas remain extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supply, weather conditions, economic conditions and actions by OPEC and other countries and government actions. Prices of oil and natural gas will affect the following aspects of our business:\n \u2022 our revenues, cash flows and earnings; \n \u2022 the amount of oil and natural gas that we are economically able to produce; \n \u2022 our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and cost of the capital; \n \u2022 the amount we are allowed to borrow under our Credit Facility; and \n \u2022 the value of our oil and natural gas properties. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the average NYMEX price for a barrel of oil was $50.80 per Bbl compared to $43.39 per Bbl for the same period of 2016. The NYMEX price for a barrel of oil ranged from a low of $42.53 per Bbl to a high of $60.42 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the average NYMEX price for natural gas was $3.02 per MMBtu compared to $2.55 per MMBtu for the same period in 2016. The NYMEX price for natural gas ranged from a low of $2.56 per MMBtu to a high of $3.42 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOil revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, oil revenues of $322 million increased $145 million, or 81%, compared to revenues of $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production and an 18% increase in the average realized sales price, which rose to $49.16 per Bbl from $41.51 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 2,125 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,191 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, oil revenues of $178 million increased $52.5 million, or 42%, compared to revenues of $125 million for the same period of 2015. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production offset by an 8% decrease in the average realized sales price, which fell to $41.51 per Bbl from $44.88 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 1,182 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 547 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenue (including NGLs)\nNatural gas revenues of $44.1 million increased $20.9 million, or 90%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily relates to a 40% increase in natural gas volumes and a 35% increase in the average price realized, which rose to $4.05 per Mcf from $2.99 per Mcf, reflecting increases in both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase in production was comprised of 1,969 MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,375 MMcf attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenues of $23.2 million increased $10.9 million, or 88%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $12.3 million for the same period of 2015. The increase primarily relates to an 80% increase in natural gas volumes and a 5% increase in", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe following management's discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the Company's results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, information about our business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors, and the transactions that underlie our financial results, which are included in various parts of this filing. Our website address is www.callon.com. All of our filings with the SEC are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. Information on our website does not form part of this report on Form 10-K.\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. We are focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore, oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico and is comprised of three primary sub-basins: the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin, and the Central Basin Platform. We have historically been focused on the Midland Basin and more recently entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017. Our operating culture is centered on responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, safety and the environment, which we believe strengthens our operational performance. Our drilling activity is predominantly focused on the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp formation and the Lower Spraberry shales. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through working interest acquisitions, leasing programs, acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps. Our production was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2017, our net acreage position in the Permian Basin was 57,481 net acres.\nSignificant accomplishments for 2017 include:\n \u2022 Increased annual production in 2017 by 50% to 8,373 MBOE as compared to 2016; \n \u2022 Increased 2017 proved reserves by 50% to 137 MMBOE as compared to 2016; \n \u2022 Entered the Delaware Basin through an acquisition completed in February 2017, acquiring approximately 29,175 gross (16,688 net) acres; \n \u2022 In 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to a four rig horizontal drilling program. \n \u2022 Issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes; and \n \u2022 Amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity. \nOperational Highlights\nAll of our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin. As a result of our acquisition and horizontal development efforts, our production grew 50% in 2017 compared to 2016, increasing to 8,373 MBOE from 5,573 MBOE. Our production in 2017 was approximately 78% oil and 22% natural gas.\nIn 2017, we transitioned from a two rig to four rig horizontal drilling program. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we drilled 49 gross (38.2 net) horizontal wells, completed 52 gross (41.4 net) horizontal wells and had four gross (2.0 net) horizontal wells awaiting completion.\nReserve Growth\nAs of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved reserves increased 50% to 137.0 MMBOE compared to 91.6 MMBOE of estimated net proved reserves at year-end 2016. Our significant growth in proved reserves was primarily attributable to our horizontal development and acquisition efforts. Our proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 were 78% oil and 22% natural gas for both periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary sources of capital have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial institutions, the sale of debt and equity securities, and asset dispositions. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties, in addition to refinancing of debt instruments.\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, we issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes to raise additional capital. In addition, we amended the borrowing base under our Credit Facility to $700 million with a current elected commitment level of $500 million, providing us with additional liquidity. We continue to evaluate other sources of capital to complement our cash flow from operations and other sources of capital as we pursue our long-term growth plans.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $229.9 million, compared to $120.8 million for the same period in 2016. The change in operating activities was predominantly attributable to the following:\n \u2022 An increase in revenue; \n \u2022 A decrease in settlements of derivative contracts; \n \u2022 An increase in certain operating expenses related to acquired properties; \n \u2022 An increase in payments in cash-settled restricted stock unit ( RSU\u201d) awards; and \n \u2022 A change related to the timing of working capital payments and receipts. \nProduction, realized prices, and operating expenses are discussed below in Results of Operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $1,072.5 million compared to $866.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 A $229.8 million increase in operational expenditures primarily due to our transition from a one-rig program in 2016 to a four-rig program in 2017. In August 2016, we transitioned from a one-rig program to a two-rig program. We transitioned from a two-rig program to a three-rig program in January 2017 and from a three-rig program to a four-rig program in July 2017; and \n \u2022 A $23.6 million decrease in acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sale of mineral interest and equipment. \nOur investing activities, on a cash basis, include the following for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\u0eff\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seismic, leasehold and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized general and administrative costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total capital expenditures(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>654,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of mineral interest and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,072,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) On an accrual (GAAP) basis, which is the methodology used for establishing our annual capital budget, operational expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $392.7 million.

On November 7, 2017, the Credit Facility's borrowing base increased to $700 million with a reaffirmed commitment of $500 million, following the semi-annual review. As of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a balance of $25 million outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.11%, calculated as the LIBOR plus a tiered rate ranging from 2.00% to 3.00%, which is determined based on utilization of the facility. In addition, the Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the borrowing base.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Credit Facility.\n6.125% Senior Notes\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes with a maturity date of October 1, 2024 and interest payable semi-annually beginning on April 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $391.3 million. The 6.125% Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating Company, and may be guaranteed by certain future subsidiaries.\nOn May 19, 2017, the Company issued an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes which with the existing $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture.\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Callon Petroleum Company\n</td> <td>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> <td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net proceeds of the offering, including a premium issue price of 104.125% and after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $206.1 million.\nSee Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes.\n10% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock\u201d)\nHolders of the Company's Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 10.0% per annum of the $50.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to $5.00 per annum per share). Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Preferred Stock dividends were $7.3 million in 2017.\nThe Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other mandatory redemption. On or after May 30, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by paying $50.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nOn February 4, 2016, the Company exchanged a total of 120,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 719,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 1,458,948 shares of its Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\nSee Note 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's Preferred Stock.\n2018 Capital Plan and Outlook\nOur operational capital budget for 2018 has been established in the range of $500 to $540 million on an accrual, or GAAP, basis, inclusive of a planned transition from a four rig program that commenced in July 2017 to a five rig program by mid-February 2018.\nAs part of our 2018 operated horizontal drilling program, we expect to place 43 to 46 net horizontal wells on production with lateral lengths ranging from 5,000' to 10,000'.\n\u0eff\nIn addition to the operational capital expenditures budget, which includes well costs, facilities and infrastructure capital, and surface land purchases, we budgeted an estimated $23 to $28 million for capitalized general and administrative expenses on an accrual, or GAAP, basis.\nOur revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices we receive for, and our ability to develop our reserves of oil and natural gas. We believe the long-term outlook for our business is favorable due to our resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. We monitor current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and our liquidity needs and may adjust our capital investment plan accordingly.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table includes the Company's current contractual obligations and purchase commitments (in thousands):\n\u0eff\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.125% Senior Notes (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other fees related to debt commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling rig leases (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office space lease and other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes the outstanding principal amount only.

Prices of oil and natural gas will affect the following aspects of our business:\n \u2022 our revenues, cash flows and earnings; \n \u2022 the amount of oil and natural gas that we are economically able to produce; \n \u2022 our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and cost of the capital; \n \u2022 the amount we are allowed to borrow under our Credit Facility; and \n \u2022 the value of our oil and natural gas properties. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the average NYMEX price for a barrel of oil was $50.80 per Bbl compared to $43.39 per Bbl for the same period of 2016. The NYMEX price for a barrel of oil ranged from a low of $42.53 per Bbl to a high of $60.42 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the average NYMEX price for natural gas was $3.02 per MMBtu compared to $2.55 per MMBtu for the same period in 2016. The NYMEX price for natural gas ranged from a low of $2.56 per MMBtu to a high of $3.42 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOil revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, oil revenues of $322 million increased $145 million, or 81%, compared to revenues of $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production and an 18% increase in the average realized sales price, which rose to $49.16 per Bbl from $41.51 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 2,125 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,191 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, oil revenues of $178 million increased $52.5 million, or 42%, compared to revenues of $125 million for the same period of 2015. The increase in oil revenue was primarily attributable to a 53% increase in production offset by an 8% decrease in the average realized sales price, which fell to $41.51 per Bbl from $44.88 per Bbl. The increase in production was comprised of 1,182 MBbls attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 547 MBbls attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenue (including NGLs)\nNatural gas revenues of $44.1 million increased $20.9 million, or 90%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily relates to a 40% increase in natural gas volumes and a 35% increase in the average price realized, which rose to $4.05 per Mcf from $2.99 per Mcf, reflecting increases in both natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase in production was comprised of 1,969 MMcf attributable to wells placed on production as a result of our horizontal drilling program and 1,375 MMcf attributable to producing wells added from our acquired properties. Offsetting these increases were normal and expected declines from our existing wells.\nNatural gas revenues of $23.2 million increased $10.9 million, or 88%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $12.3 million for the same period of 2015. The increase primarily relates to an 80% increase in natural gas volumes and a 5% increase in"}
