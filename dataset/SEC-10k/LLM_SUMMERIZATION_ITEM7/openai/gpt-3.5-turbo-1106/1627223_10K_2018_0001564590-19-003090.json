change in net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net sales increased by $455 million (or 7%) to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net sales of $6.2 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 7% increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, improved pricing for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and higher average selling prices across all product lines in our Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 1% from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by a 1% decrease in volume, which was primarily attributable to lower demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment.\nOur net sales increased by $783 million (or 15%) to $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net sales of $5.4 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to an 11% increase in volume, driven by higher demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, the increased adoption of OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and increased volume across most businesses in the Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 8% due to an increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, and improved pricing for base refrigerants in our Fluoroproducts segment. These increases were partially offset by portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment, which reduced net sales by 4%.\nThe Chemours Company\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) increased by $229 million (or 5%) to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with COGS of $4.4 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher costs for certain raw materials, higher distribution, freight, and logistics expenses, and process waste water treatment costs. These increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur COGS increased by $141 million (or 3%) to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with COGS of $4.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in volume, as well as increases in costs associated with our transformation activities and higher performance-related compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impacts of portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nOur selling, general, and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $657 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with SG&A expense of $626 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the accrual of an additional estimated liability for ongoing legal matters at our Fayetteville Works site in Fayetteville, North Carolina. This increase was partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur SG&A expense decreased by $320 million (or 34%) to $626 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with SG&A expense of $946 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the 2016 accrual of $335 million in legal costs in connection with the PFOA MDL Settlement, as well as lower management and administrative expenses resulting from the sales of our Clean & Disinfect ( C&D\u201d) and Sulfur businesses in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs associated with our transformation activities, and higher performance-related compensation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expense\nOur R&D expense was largely unchanged at $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nRestructuring, Asset-related, and Other Charges\nOur restructuring, asset-related, and other charges amounted to $49 million, $57 million, and $170 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $27 million, and employee separation charges of $5 million for our 2018 restructuring program. In addition, we recognized $13 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the demolition and removal of certain unused buildings at our Chambers Works site in Deepwater, New Jersey, and an asset-related charge of $4 million for a goodwill impairment in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $32 million, and a combined $24 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges for the production shutdown at our Reactive Metals Solutions ( RMS\u201d) manufacturing site in Niagara Falls, New York, the closure of our TiO2 pigment plant in Edge Moor, Delaware, and the shutdown of certain U.S. production lines in our Fluoroproducts segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $58 million, related to the sale of our Sulfur business, $48 million, for the write-down of certain assets at our Aniline plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and $13 million, related to the sale of our corporate headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. In addition, we recognized $45 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the closure of our Edge Moor plant.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliates\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $10 million (or 30%) to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with equity in earnings of affiliates of $33 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our equity in earnings of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increased profitability for our equity method investees in the Fluoroproducts segment.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates was largely unchanged at $33 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $19 million (or 9%) to $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with interest expense, net of $214 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in both interest income and capitalized interest, the latter being attributable to ongoing progress on our OpteonTM refrigerants facility in Corpus Christi, Texas during 2018, and the construction of our new Mining Solutions facility, prior to its suspension during the first half of 2018.\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $5 million (or 2%) to $214 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with interest expense, net of $219 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to decreased interest from the repricing of our senior secured term loan in 2017, as well as lower outstanding principal amounts on the same. This decrease was partially offset by additional interest from the issuance of our 5.375% senior unsecured notes due May 2027 in 2017.\n(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a combined loss on extinguishment of debt of $38 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, and our tender offers to purchase any and all of our outstanding euro-denominated 6.125% senior unsecured notes due May 2023 and a portion of our outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated 6.625% senior unsecured notes due May 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million in connection with an amendment to our then-existing credit agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $6 million, which is the net result of a $10 million gain in connection with the open market repurchases of certain portions of our senior unsecured notes, and a $4 million loss on the write-off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the reduction in commitment on our then-existing revolving credit facility.\nOther Income, Net\nOur other income, net increased by $49 million (or 43%) to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with other income, net of $113 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a $49 million increase in miscellaneous income, which included increased EU quota authorization sales in our Fluoroproducts segment, and a $42 million gain on the sale of our Linden, New Jersey site. These increases were partially offset by decreases in royalty income and non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit income.\nOur other income, net decreased by $154 million (or 58%) to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with other income, net of $267 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our other income, net for 2017 was primarily attributable to gains of $169 million and $89 million on the sales of our C&D business and our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas during 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by a $3 million gain on favorable foreign currency movements for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a $57 million foreign currency loss due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso for the same period in 2016.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOur provisions for income taxes amounted to $159 million and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our benefit from income taxes amounted to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represented effective tax rates of 14%, 18%, and 164%, respectively.\nThe $6 million decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributable to the decreased federal corporate income tax rate under U.S. tax reform. In addition, our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $14 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $15 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits, and a net $10 million benefit from certain other provisions of U.S. tax reform. These decreases were partially offset by additional tax expense resulting from increased profitability, and the geographical mix of our earnings.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe $183 million increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with the same period in 2016, was primarily attributable to increased profitability and the geographic mix of our earnings. These increases were partially offset by $22 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $6 million benefit from the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions, and a $3 million net benefit from our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform. Our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform included tax expense associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (the Transition Tax\u201d) on our unremitted foreign earnings, a release of the valuation allowance on carryforward foreign tax credits utilized against the Transition Tax, and the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as a result of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\nSegment Reviews\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) represents our primary measure of segment performance and is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, excluding the following:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> interest expense, depreciation, and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs, which represent the component of net periodic pension (income) costs excluding the service cost component;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> exchange (gains) losses included in other income (expense), net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> restructuring, asset-related, and other charges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> (gains) losses on sales of assets and businesses;

The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to: a 4% increase in volume, driven by the continued adoption of our OpteonTM refrigerants; a 3% increase in price, driven by improved pricing for our fluoropolymers products; and, a 1% increase to segment net sales from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nSegment net sales increased by $390 million (or 17%) to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $2.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in volume, driven by significantly stronger global demand for our OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for our fluoropolymers products, and a 1% increase in price, driven by higher average selling prices for our base refrigerants. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, lower average selling prices for our fluoropolymers products, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $114 million (or 17%) to $783 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 200 basis points to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, as well as favorable foreign currency movements and EU quota authorization sales of $67 million. These increases were partially offset by higher costs for certain raw materials, distribution expenses, and process waste water treatment costs.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $224 million (or 50%) to $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $445 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, and EU quota authorization sales of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by higher performance-related compensation expenses, and higher costs associated with our transformation activities.\nThe segment's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included $34 million and $11 million of additional costs for process waste water treatment at our Fayetteville, North Carolina site, respectively.\nChemical Solutions\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Chemical Solutions segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Chemical Solutions segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in segment net sales from prior period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio/other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change in segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Net Sales\nSegment net sales increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $602 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment net sales of $571 million for the same period in 2017. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices across all product lines.\nSegment net sales decreased by $201 million (or 26%) to $571 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $772 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to portfolio changes resulting from the sales of the segment's C&D and Sulfur businesses, the sale of the segment's Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, and the production shutdown at the segment's RMS facility in Niagara Falls, New York, which combined, affected a 31% decrease in the segment's net sales. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in volume, and a 1% increase in price across most of the segment's remaining businesses.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7 million (or 12%) to $64 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 100 basis points to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in price.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million (or 46%) to $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $39 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to cost reductions from the aforementioned portfolio changes, as well as increases in volume and price for the segment's remaining businesses.\nTitanium Technologies\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Titanium Technologies segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Chemours Company\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Titanium Technologies segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in segment net sales from prior period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio/other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change in segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Net Sales\nSegment net sales increased by $216 million (or 7%) to $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment net sales of $3.0 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 12% increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for our Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment, and a 1% increase from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in volume, which was the result of lower demand for our Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment when compared with the same period in 2017.\nSegment net sales increased by $594 million (or 25%) to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $2.4 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 17% increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for our Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment, and an 8% increase in volume, driven by higher global demand for our Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment across most regions.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $193 million (or 22%) to $1.1 billion and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 400 basis points to 33% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $862 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 29% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in price and currency. These increases were partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in volume, as well as higher costs for certain raw materials and higher freight and logistics expenses.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $396 million (or 85%) to $862 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 900 basis points to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $466 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in price and volume. These increases were partially offset by higher performance-related compensation expenses, higher costs associated with our transformation activities, and higher costs for certain raw materials.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate costs and certain legacy legal and environmental expenses, stock-based compensation costs, and foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of balances in currencies other than the functional currency of our legal entities are reflected in Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other costs were largely unchanged for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 at $162 million and $166 million, respectively. Corporate and Other costs increased by $38 million (or 30%) to $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with Corporate and Other costs of $128 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in Corporate and Other costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in costs associated with legacy environmental and legal issues, as well as higher performance-related compensation expenses.\nThe Chemours Company\n2019 Outlook\nOur 2019 results will be driven by the following expectations: (i) 2019 volume for our Titanium Technologies segment will be below 2018 volume levels; (ii) there will be continued transition to OpteonTM refrigerants, as well as increased demand for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment; and, (iii) there will be continued demand for Mining Solutions products in our Chemical Solutions segment. We expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately $500 million. Our outlook for 2019 reflects our current visibility and expectations based on market factors, such as currency movements, macro-economic factors, and end-market demand. Our ability to meet these expectations are subject to numerous risks, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash, and borrowings under our debt financing arrangements, which are described in further detail in Note 19 - Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our planned operations and to meet our interest, dividend, and contractual obligations. Our financial policy seeks to: (i) selectively invest in organic and inorganic growth to enhance our portfolio, including certain strategic capital investments; (ii) return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and, (iii) maintain appropriate leverage by using free cash flows to repay outstanding borrowings. Subject to approval by our board of directors, we may raise additional capital or borrowings from time to time, or seek to refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that future capital or borrowings will be available to us, and the cost and availability of new capital or borrowings could be materially impacted by market conditions. Further, the decision to refinance our existing debt is based on a number of factors, including general market conditions and our ability to refinance on attractive terms at any given point in time. Any attempts to raise additional capital or borrowings, or refinance our existing debt, could cause us to incur significant charges. Such charges could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operating cash flow generation is driven by, among other things, the general global economic conditions at any point in time and their resulting impact on demand for our products, raw materials and energy prices, and industry-specific issues, such as production capacity and utilization. We have generated strong operating cash flows through various industry and economic cycles, evidencing the operating strength of our businesses.\nIn May 2018, we completed our $500 million 2017 Share Repurchase Program. On August 1, 2018, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share. Additionally, on August 1, 2018, our board of directors approved the 2018 Share Repurchase Program, which authorizes us to purchase shares of our issued and outstanding common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750 million, plus any fees or costs in connection with our share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2019, our board of directors increased the authorization amount of the 2018 Share Repurchase Program to $1.0 billion. The 2018 Share Repurchase Program became effective on August 1, 2018 and will continue through the earlier of its expiration on December 31, 2020, or the completion of repurchases up to the approved amount.\nWe anticipate making significant payments for interest, capital expenditures, environmental remediation costs and investments, dividends, and other actions over the next 12 months, which we expect to fund through cash generated from operations, available cash, and borrowings. We further anticipate that our operations and existing debt financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient liquidity over the next 12 months. The availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is discussed further in Note 19 - Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is subject to the last 12 months of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion, of which, $953 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and certain of these foreign subsidiaries' earnings are indefinitely reinvested. All of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is readily convertible into currencies used in our operations, including the U.S. dollar. The cash and earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are generally used to finance their operations and capital expenditures. At December 31, 2018, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the U.S., and it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the historical pre-2018 earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, management asserts that only certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. See Note 9 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income tax positions.\nThe Chemours Company\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used for) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (993\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (396\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nWe received $1.1 billion, $640 million, and $594 million in cash flows from our operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in our operating cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to an improvement in our net income compared with the same period in 2017, and our payment of the $335 million liability to settle the PFOA MDL Settlement in 2017, which negatively impacted our operating cash flows from working capital. The increase in our operating cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to an improvement in our net income compared with the same period in 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease to our operating cash flows from working capital for the aforementioned payment of the PFOA MDL Settlement liability, as well as other changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nWe used $487 million in cash flows for our investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our investing cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to purchases of property, plant, and equipment amounting to $498 million, and $37 million in total cash consideration payments for the acquisition of ICOR International, Inc. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses of $46 million, which were primarily attributable to the sale of our Linden, New Jersey site for $39 million.\nWe used $370 million in cash flows for our investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our investing cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to purchases of property, plant, and equipment amounting to $411 million. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses of $39 million, which were primarily attributable to the sale of our corporate headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware for $29 million, and the sale of land that held our former manufacturing plant in Edge Moor, Delaware for $10 million.\nWe received $357 million in cash flows from our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our investing cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses of $708 million, including $223 million for the sale of our C&D business, $321 million for the sale of our Sulfur business, and $140 million for the sale of our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas. These investing cash inflows were partially offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment amounting to $338 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe used $993 million in cash flows for our financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our financing cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the following: $679 million in debt repayments and $29 million in make-whole\u201d premium payments in connection with our debt refinancing activities, as well as scheduled principal repayments; $644 million for purchases of our issued and outstanding common stock under our share repurchase programs; and, $148 million for payments of cash dividends. These financing cash outflows were partially offset by $520 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our euro-denominated 4.000% senior unsecured notes due May 2026.\nWe received $352 million in cash flows from our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our financing cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to $495 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5.375% senior unsecured notes due May 2027. These financing cash inflows were partially offset by $106 million for purchases of our issued and outstanding common stock under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.\nWe used $396 million in cash flows for our financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our financing cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to $381 million in debt repayments in connection with the open market repurchases of certain portions of our senior unsecured notes, as well as scheduled principal repayments.\nThe Chemours Company\nCurrent Assets\nThe following table sets forth the components of our current assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts and notes receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur accounts and notes receivable, net decreased by $58 million (or 6%) to $861 million at December 31, 2018, compared with accounts and notes receivable, net of $919 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in our accounts and notes receivable, net at December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the same period in 2017, as well as the timing of customer receipts.\nOur inventories increased by $212 million (or 23%) to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with inventories of $935 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in our inventories at December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to our strategic acquisition of ore due to favorable contractual arrangements, inventory build-up for plant turnarounds, and higher costs for certain raw materials.\nOur prepaid expenses and other assets were largely unchanged at $84 million and $83 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCurrent Liabilities\nThe following table sets forth the components of our current liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other accrued liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur accounts payable increased by $62 million (or 6%) to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with accounts payable of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017.

Under these agreements, the financial institutions act as our paying agents with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers who elect to participate in the program. The agreements allow our suppliers to sell their receivables to one of the participating financial institutions at the discretion of both parties on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers' decisions to sell their receivables under this program. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total payment instructions from us amounted to $210 million and $172 million, respectively. Pursuant to their agreement with one of the financial institutions, certain suppliers may elect to be paid early at their discretion. The available capacity under these programs can vary based on the number of investors and/or financial institutions participating in these programs at any point in time.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations are capital intensive, requiring ongoing investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations.

financial resources to satisfy these guarantees in the event required.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our recent accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters, and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts, and circumstances available at the time, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. We review these matters and reflect changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies, which could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Chemours Company\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year, plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the ability to realize deferred tax assets, we rely on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results.\nThe breadth of our operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the taxes that we will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation, and resolutions of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits in the normal course of business. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded when management concludes that the likelihood of sustaining such positions upon examination by taxing authorities is less than more-likely-than-not. It is our policy to include accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in other income, net and income tax-related penalties in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes.\nThe SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB No. 118\u201d), which allowed registrants to record provisional estimates for the legislation commonly referred to as U.S. tax reform during a measurement period not to exceed one year from its enactment date, December 22, 2017. While management has completed its analysis within the applicable measurement period, pursuant to SAB No. 118, we are accounting for the income tax impacts of the provisions of U.S. tax reform based on the interpretation of existing statutory law, including guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS. During the second half of 2018, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS issued certain proposed regulations addressing new provisions such as Global Intangible Low-taxed Income, Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax, Limitation of Deduction of Business Interest, Foreign Tax Credit, and the Anti-hybrid Regulations. On January 15, 2019, the final Section 965 Toll Charge regulations were issued. There can be no assurances as to the effect of any final regulations on our income tax provision. We will continue to evaluate the impact of new regulations issued when they become final and adjust our estimates, as appropriate.\nSee Note 9 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income tax positions.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of recognition or measurement of an impairment charge, the assessment is performed on the asset or asset group at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. To determine the level at which the assessment is performed, we consider factors such as revenue dependency, shared costs, and the extent of vertical integration. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value, which is made based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies, including present value techniques. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held for use until their disposal. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair market value, less the estimated costs to sell. Depreciation is discontinued for any long-lived assets classified as held for sale.\nThe testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which our segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth, and inflation rates, can significantly impact the outcome of our impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in the factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, we continually review our diverse portfolio of assets to ensure that they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with our growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.\nNo impairment charges on our long-lived assets were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $48 million pre-tax impairment charge on our Aniline facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, a $58 million pre-tax impairment charge in connection with the sale of our Sulfur business, and a $13 million pre-tax impairment charge in connection with the sale of our corporate headquarters building located in Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe Chemours Company\nEmployee Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to pension and other long-term employee benefits plans are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected returns on plan assets, discount rates at which liabilities are expected to be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, and mortality rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 26 - Long-term Employee Benefits\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differed from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.\nWe use discount rates that are developed by matching the expected cash flows of each benefit plan to various yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average discount rate was 2.0%.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation of the underlying asset class applicable to each country. We also consider our historical experience with the pension funds' asset performance. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are assumptions and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rates of return on plan assets assumptions used for determining our net periodic pension expense for 2018 was 4.1%.\nA 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease of less than $1 million to the net periodic benefit cost for 2019, while a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately $10 million. A 50 basis point increase in the expected return on plan assets assumption would result in a decrease of approximately $6 million to the net periodic benefit cost for 2019, while a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would result in an increase of approximately $6 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the local pension board responsible for our defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands decided to proceed with a restructuring of that plan to ensure its long-term sustainability. As a part of this restructuring, the plan administrators expect to irrevocably transfer liabilities associated with vested retirees to a third-party insurance company through the purchase of annuity contracts. This transfer is expected to occur during 2019, and is subject to the completion of certain regulatory reviews and other administrative steps. The purchase of these annuity contracts will be funded by the existing plan assets, and will not require us to make any additional cash contributions. Based on our current projections, the transfer is expected to meet the criteria for settlement accounting, resulting in a non-cash charge of approximately $415 million. At December 31, 2018, our accumulated other comprehensive loss included deferred losses of approximately $185 million related to this plan, which will be reclassified to our consolidated statements of operations as a component of the aforementioned non-cash charge on settlement.\nLitigation\nWe accrue for litigation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Litigation liabilities and expenditures included in our consolidated financial statements include litigation matters that are liabilities of DuPont and its subsidiaries, that we may be required to indemnify pursuant to the Separation-related agreements executed prior to the Separation. Disputes between us and DuPont may arise with respect to indemnification of these matters, including disputes based on matters of law or contract interpretation. If, and to the extent these disputes arise, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period services are received.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Expenditures\nWe accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more-likely-than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated liabilities are determined based on existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations, primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. These accruals are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and as additional technology, regulatory, and legal information become available.\nEnvironmental liabilities and expenditures include claims for matters that are liabilities of DuPont and its subsidiaries, which we may be required to indemnify pursuant to the Separation-related agreements executed prior to the Separation. Accrued liabilities are undiscounted and do not include claims against third-parties.\nThe Chemours Company\nCosts related to environmental remediation are charged to expense in the period incurred. Other environmental costs are also charged to expense in the period incurred, unless they increase the value of the property or reduce or prevent contamination from future operations, in which case, they are capitalized and amortized.\nEnvironmental Matters\nConsistent with our values and our Environment, Health, and Safety policy, we are committed to preventing releases to the environment at our manufacturing sites to keep our people and communities safe, and to be good stewards of the environment. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, standards, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of harm to people and the environment, and that our handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nWe incur costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and waste water treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. Annual expenses charged to current operations include environmental operating costs and the increase in the remediation accrual (further described below), if any, during the period reported.\nThe charges described in this section include $10 million of the total $75 million accrued for costs associated with the proposed Consent Order between us and the NC DEQ, which is further described in Note 21 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The $10 million described herein represents on-site remediation activities recorded as part of our total environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2018. The remaining $65 million includes items such as fines, penalties, and off-site remediation activities at our Fayetteville, North Carolina site, and has been recorded as a component of our total accrued litigation reserves at December 31, 2018.\nIn the longer-term, our environmental remediation expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures (further described below) are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage, and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the CAA. Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for our future capital expenditures.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we spent $57 million, $15 million, and $13 million, respectively, on environmental capital projects that were either required by law or necessary to meet our internal environmental objectives. The increase in our environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared with the same periods in 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to new capital projects at our Fayetteville, North Carolina site. We expect further increases in these capital expenditures over the near-term, while in the longer-term, our capital expenditures for environmental remediation will vary based on the success of our deployed solutions, changes in our operations, technological advancements, as well as developments in environmental requirements and stakeholder expectations.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nIn large part, because of past operations, operations of predecessor companies, or past disposal practices, we, like many other similar companies, have clean-up responsibilities and associated remediation costs, and are subject to claims by other parties, including claims for matters that are liabilities of DuPont and its subsidiaries that we may be required to indemnify pursuant to the Separation-related agreements executed prior to the Separation.\nWe accrue for clean-up activities consistent with the policy described under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d within this MD&A and in Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our environmental reserve includes estimated costs related to a number of sites for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, whether or not subject to enforcement activities, as well as those obligations that result from environmental laws such as the CERCLA, RCRA, and similar federal, state, local, and foreign laws. These laws require certain investigative, remediation, and restoration activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded environmental remediation accruals of $226 million and $253 million, respectively, relating to these matters which, in management's opinion, are appropriate based on existing facts and circumstances.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe following table sets forth the activities in our remediation accruals for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in remediation accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remediation payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur estimated liability for environmental remediation covered 211 and 212 sites at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth our estimated environmental liability by site category.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Site category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of Sites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Remediation Accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of Sites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Remediation Accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemours-owned (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-party Superfund/non-owned (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Closed or settled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total sites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes remediation accrual of divested or sold sites where certain environmental obligations were retained by us in accordance with the related sale agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Sites not owned by us, including sites previously owned by DuPont and sites owned by a third-party, where remediation obligations are imposed by Superfund laws such as CERCLA or similar state laws.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of our legacy as a former subsidiary of DuPont, we are cleaning-up historical impacts to soil and groundwater that have occurred in the past at the 25 sites that we own. These operating and former operating sites make up approximately 60% of our remediation reserve at December 31, 2018.\nWe were also assigned numerous clean-up obligations from DuPont, which pertain to 86 sites previously owned by DuPont and sites that we or DuPont never owned or operated. We are meeting our obligations to clean-up those sites. The majority of these never-owned sites are multi-party Superfund sites that we, through DuPont, have been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or similar state laws and which, in some cases, may represent a small fraction of the total waste that was allegedly disposed of at a site. These sites represent approximately 40% of our remediation reserve at December 31, 2018. Included in the 211 sites are 36 inactive sites for which there has been no known investigation, clean-up, or monitoring activity, and no remediation obligation is imposed or required; as such, no remediation accrual is recorded.\nThe remaining 100 sites, which are Superfund sites and other sites not owned by us, are either already closed or settled, or sites for which we do not believe we have clean-up responsibility based on current information.\nOur remediation portfolio is relatively mature, with many of our sites under active clean-up moving towards final completion.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe following graph sets forth the number of remediation sites by site clean-up phase and our remediation reserve by site clean-up phase as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Number of sites does not include the 36 and 35 inactive sites for which there has been no known investigation, clean-up, or monitoring activities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Dollars in millions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs remediation efforts progress, sites move from the investigation phase ( Investigation\u201d) to the active clean-up phase ( Active Remediation\u201d), and as construction is completed at Active Remediation sites, those sites move to the operation, maintenance, and monitoring ( OM&M\u201d), or closure phase. As final clean-up activities for some significant sites are completed over the next several years, we expect our annual expenses related to these active sites to decline over time. The time frame for a site to go through all phases of remediation (Investigation and Active Remediation) may take about 15 to 20 years, followed by several years of OM&M activities. Remediation activities, including OM&M activities, vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, and diverse regulatory requirements, as well as the presence or absence of other PRPs. In addition, for claims that we may be required to indemnify DuPont pursuant to the Separation-related agreements, we, through DuPont, have limited available information for certain sites or are in the early stages of discussions with regulators. For these sites in particular, there may be considerable variability between the clean-up activities that are currently being undertaken or planned and the ultimate actions that could be required. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, although deemed remote, the potential liability may range up to approximately $450 million above the amount accrued at December 31, 2018. In general, uncertainty is greatest and the range of potential liability is widest in the Investigation phase, narrowing over time as regulatory agencies approve site remedial plans. As a result, uncertainty is reduced, and sites ultimately move into OM&M, as needed. As more sites advance from Investigation to Active Remediation to OM&M or closure, the upper end of the range of potential liability is expected to decrease over time.\nSome remediation sites will achieve site closure and will require no further action to protect people and the environment and comply with laws and regulations. At certain sites, we expect that there will continue to be some level of remediation activity due to ongoing OM&M of remedial systems. In addition, portfolio changes, such as an acquisition or divestiture, or notification as a PRP for a multi-party Superfund site, could result in additional remediation activity and potentially additional accrual.\nManagement does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows at any given year, as such obligation can be satisfied or settled over many years.\nThe Chemours Company\nWhile there are many remediation sites that contribute to the total environmental remediation accrual, the following table sets forth the sites that are the most significant.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chambers Works, Deepwater, New Jersey\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> East Chicago, Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pompton Lakes, New Jersey\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USS Lead, East Chicago, Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other sites\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total accrued environmental remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe five sites listed above represent approximately 50% of our reserve as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect to spend, in the aggregate, approximately $60 million over the next three years. For all other sites, we expect to spend approximately $80 million over the next three years.\nChambers Works, Deepwater, New Jersey\nThe Chambers Works complex is located on the eastern shore of the Delaware River in Deepwater, Salem County, New Jersey. The site comprises the former Carneys Point Works in the northern area and the Chambers Works manufacturing area in the southern area. Site operations began in 1892 when the former Carneys Point smokeless gunpowder plant was constructed at the northern end of Carneys Point. Site operations began in the manufacturing area around 1914 and included the manufacture of dyes, aromatics, elastomers, chlorofluorocarbons, and tetraethyl lead. We continue to manufacture a variety of fluorochemicals and finished products at Chambers Works. In addition, three tenants operate processes at Chambers Works including steam/electricity generation, industrial gas production, and the manufacture of intermediate chemicals. As a result of over 100 years of continuous industrial activity, site soils and groundwater have been impacted by chemical releases.\nIn response to identified groundwater contamination, a groundwater interceptor well system ( IWS\u201d) was installed in 1970, which was designed to contain contaminated groundwater and restrict off-site migration. Additional remediation is being completed under a federal RCRA Corrective Action Permit. The site has been studied extensively over the years, and more than 25 remedial actions have been completed to date and engineering and institutional controls put in place to ensure protection of people and the environment. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a site perimeter sheet pile barrier intended to more efficiently contain groundwater was completed.\nRemaining work beyond continued operation of the IWS and groundwater monitoring includes completion of various targeted studies onsite and in adjacent water bodies to close investigation data gaps, as well as selection and implementation of final remedies under RCRA Corrective Action for various solid waste management units and areas of concern not yet addressed through interim measures.\nEast Chicago, Indiana\nEast Chicago is a former manufacturing facility owned by us in East Chicago, Lake County, Indiana. The approximate 440-acre site is bounded to the south by the east branch of the Grand Calumet River, to the east and north by residential and commercial areas, and to the west by industrial areas, including a former lead processing facility. The inorganic chemicals unit on site produced various chloride, ammonia, and zinc products and inorganic agricultural chemicals beginning in 1892 until 1986. Organic chemical manufacturing began in 1944, consisting primarily of CFCs production. Current operations, including support activities, now cover 28 acres of the site. The remaining business was sold to W.R. Grace Company ( Grace\u201d) in early 2000, and Grace operates the unit as a tenant. Approximately 172 acres of the site were never developed and are managed by The Nature Conservancy for habitat preservation.\nA comprehensive evaluation of soil and groundwater conditions at the site was performed as part of the RCRA Corrective Action process. Studies of historical site impacts began in 1983 in response to preliminary CERCLA actions undertaken by the EPA. The EPA eventually issued an Administrative Order on Consent for the site in 1997. The order specified that remediation work be performed under RCRA Corrective Action authority. Work has proceeded under the RCRA Corrective Action process since that time.\nThe Chemours Company\nSubsequent investigations included the preparation of initial environmental site assessments and multiple phases of investigation. In 2002, as an interim remedial measure, two 2,000-foot long permeable reactive barrier treatment walls were installed along the northern property boundary to address migration of chemicals in groundwater. Since that time, the investigation process has been completed and approved by the EPA, and the final remedy for the site has been selected by the EPA and posted for public comment.\nFayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina\nThe Fayetteville Works facility is located 15 miles southeast of the City of Fayetteville in Cumberland and Bladen counties, North Carolina. The facility encompasses approximately 2,200 acres, which were purchased by DuPont in 1970, and are bounded to the east by the Cape Fear River and to the west by North Carolina Highway 87. Currently, the site manufactures plastic sheeting, fluorochemicals, and intermediates for plastics manufacturing. A former manufacturing area, which was sold in 1992, produced nylon strapping and elastomeric tape. DuPont sold its Butacite\u00ae and SentryGlas\u00ae manufacturing units to Kuraray America, Inc. in June 2014. In July 2015, upon our Separation from DuPont, we became the owner of the Fayetteville Works land assets along with fluoromonomers, Nafion\u00ae membranes, and the related polymer processing aid ( PPA\u201d) manufacturing units. A polyvinyl fluoride ( PVF\u201d) resin manufacturing unit remained with DuPont.\nBeginning in 1996, several stages of site investigation were conducted under NC DEQ oversight, as required by the facility's hazardous waste permit. In addition, the site has voluntarily agreed to agency requests for additional investigations of the potential release of PFAS beginning with PFOA in 2006. As a result of detection of the polymer processing aid GenX in on-site groundwater wells during our investigations in 2017, the NCDEQ issued an NOV on September 6, 2017 alleging violations of North Carolina water quality statutes and requiring further response. Since that time, and in response to three additional NOVs issued by NCDEQ, we have worked cooperatively with the agency to investigate and address releases of PFAS to on-site and off-site groundwater and surface water.\nAs discussed under \"Recent Developments\" in this MD&A, and further in Note 21 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we and the NC DEQ have filed a proposed Consent Order intended to comprehensively address various issues, NOVs, and court filings made by the NC DEQ regarding our Fayetteville, North Carolina facility and resolve litigations filed by the NC DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch, a non-profit organization. Of the total estimated liability of $75 million accrued for this matter as of December 31, 2018, $10 million is related to on-site groundwater and surface water conditions that require further study and cleanup action under the proposed Consent Order and is included within our overall environmental remediation accrual.\nPompton Lakes, New Jersey\nDuring the 20th century, blasting caps, fuses, and related materials were manufactured at Pompton Lakes, Passaic County, New Jersey. Operating activities at the site were ceased in the mid-1990s. The primary contaminants in the soil and sediments are lead and mercury. Groundwater contaminants include volatile organic compounds. Under the authority of the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, remedial actions at the site are focused on investigating and cleaning-up the area. Groundwater monitoring at the site is ongoing, and we have installed and continue to install vapor mitigation systems at residences within the groundwater plume. In addition, we are further assessing groundwater conditions. In June 2015, the EPA issued a modification to the site's RCRA permit that requires us to dredge mercury contamination from a 36-acre area of the lake and remove sediment from two other areas of the lake near the shoreline. The remediation activities commenced when permits and implementation plans were approved in May 2016, and work on the lake dredging project is now complete.\nU.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc., East Chicago, Indiana\nThe U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc. ( USS Lead\u201d) Superfund site is located in the Calumet neighborhood of East Chicago, Lake County, Indiana. The site includes the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial, municipal, and residential areas. The primary compounds of interest are lead and arsenic which may be found in soils within the impacted area. The EPA is directing and organizing remediation on this site, and we are one of a number of parties working cooperatively with the EPA on the safe and timely completion of this work. DuPont's former East Chicago manufacturing facility was located adjacent to the site, and DuPont assigned responsibility for the site to us in the separation agreement.\nThe USS Lead Superfund site was listed on the National Priorities List in 2009. To facilitate negotiations with PRPs, the EPA divided the residential part of the USS Lead Superfund site into three zones, referred to as Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. The division into three zones resulted in Atlantic Richfield Co. and DuPont entering into an agreement in 2014 with the EPA and the State of Indiana to reimburse the EPA's costs to implement clean-up in Zone 1 and Zone 3. More recently, in March 2017, we and three other parties (Atlantic Richfield Co., DuPont, and the U.S. Metals Refining Co.) entered into an administrative order on consent to reimburse the EPA's costs to clean-up a portion of Zone 2. In March 2018, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for the remainder of the Zone 2 work to five parties, including us, Atlantic Richfield Co., DuPont, the U.S. Metals Refining Co., and USS Lead Muller Group, and these parties have entered into an interim allocation agreement to complete that work by the end of 2019. There is uncertainty as to whether these parties will be able to agree on a final allocation for Zone 2 and/or the other Zones, and whether any additional PRPs may be identified.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe environmental accrual for USS Lead continues to be based on the 2012 Record of Decision ( ROD\u201d) and Statement of Work for Zone 1 and the associated portion of Zone 3 not yet completed, as well as the current estimate of our share of remaining Zone 2 clean-up. The EPA released a proposed amendment to the 2012 ROD for a portion of Zone 1 in December 2018 (following its August 2018 Feasibility Study Addendum), with its recommended option based on future residential use. However, the proposed amendment was sent out for public comment with the EPA's statement that the remedy basis and cost may change based on community input on future land use. The EPA's final decision is expected some time in the first half of 2019. We expect that our future costs for Zone 1 will be contingent on this remedy decision, as well as any final allocation between PRPs.\nClimate Change\nWe are taking prudent, practical, and cost-effective actions to address climate change as we grow our operations and help our customers do the same. We are committed to improving our resource efficiency, to acting on opportunities to reduce our greenhouse gas ( GHG\u201d) emissions, to enhancing the eco-efficiency of our supply chain, and to encouraging our employees to reduce their own environmental footprints. We understand that maintaining safe, sustainable operations has an impact on us, our communities, the environment, and our collective future. We continue to invest in R&D to develop safer, cleaner, and more efficient products and processes that help our customers and consumers reduce both their GHGs and their overall environmental footprint. We value collaboration to drive change and commit to working with policymakers, our value chain, and other organizations to encourage collective action for reducing GHGs.\nPFOA\nSee our discussion under the heading PFOA\u201d in Note 21 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Chemours Company\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures - Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share ( Adjusted EPS\u201d), Free Cash Flows ( FCF\u201d), and Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC\u201d) - in order to clarify and provide investors with a better understanding of our performance when analyzing changes in our underlying business between reporting periods and to provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment profitability used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before taxes, excluding the following:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> interest expense, depreciation, and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs, which represent the components of net periodic pension (income) costs excluding the service cost component;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> exchange (gains) losses included in other income (expense), net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> restructuring, asset-related, and other charges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> (gains) losses on sales of assets and businesses; and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other items not considered indicative of our ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as our net income or loss, adjusted for items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, except interest expense, depreciation, amortization, and certain provision for (benefit from) income tax amounts. Adjusted EPS is presented on a diluted basis and is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding, accounting for the dilutive impact of our stock-based compensation awards. FCF is defined as our cash flows provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant, and equipment as shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows. ROIC is defined as Adjusted EBIT, divided by the average of our invested capital, which amounts to net debt plus equity.\nWe believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing our operating performance and underlying prospects. This analysis should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) supplements the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and the results of our operations for the periods presented. Our forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that may not be accurate or realized. These statements, as well as our historical performance, are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Additionally, there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to identify at this time or that we do not currently expect to have a material impact on our business. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed within Item 1A - Risk Factors. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a leading, global provider of performance chemicals that are key inputs in end-products and processes in a variety of industries. We deliver customized solutions with a wide range of industrial and specialty chemical products for markets, including plastics and coatings, refrigeration and air conditioning, general industrial, electronics, mining, and oil refining. Our principal products include refrigerants, industrial fluoropolymer resins, sodium cyanide, performance chemicals and intermediates, and TiO2 pigment. We manage and report our operating results through three reportable segments: Fluoroproducts, Chemical Solutions, and Titanium Technologies. The Fluoroproducts segment is a leading, global provider of fluoroproducts, including refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins. The Chemical Solutions segment is a leading, North American provider of industrial chemicals used in gold production, industrial, and consumer applications. The Titanium Technologies segment is a leading, global provider of TiO2 pigment, a premium white pigment used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity, and protection in a variety of applications.\nRecent Developments\nCorpus Christi, Texas\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we reached mechanical completion of our new OpteonTM refrigerants facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. This facility will enable us to triple the global capacity of OpteonTM over the next few years to meet increasing market demands for environmentally-sustainable refrigerants and blends.\nFayetteville, North Carolina\nWe, along with the NC DEQ, have filed a proposed Consent Order intended to comprehensively address issues, NOVs, and court filings made by the NC DEQ regarding our Fayetteville, North Carolina facility and resolve litigations filed by the NC DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch, a non-profit organization. Pursuant to the proposed Consent Order, which is subject to approval by the court, we will agree to pay $13 million to cover a civil penalty and investigative costs and will take additional actions to address site surface water, groundwater, and air emissions. At December 31, 2018, we have accrued an estimated liability for this matter of $75 million.\nCapital Allocation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we returned $792 million in cash to our shareholders by purchasing $644 million in our issued and outstanding common stock under our share repurchase programs, and through the payment of $148 million in cash dividends.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we purchased an additional $150 million of our issued and outstanding common stock under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program.\nOn February 13, 2019, our board of directors increased the authorization amount of our 2018 Share Repurchase Program from $750 million to $1.0 billion.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur Results of Operations and Business Highlights\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nOur net sales increased by $455 million (or 7%) to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net sales of $6.2 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 7% increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, improved pricing for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and higher average selling prices across all product lines in our Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 1% from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by a 1% decrease in volume, which was primarily attributable to lower demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment.\nOur net sales increased by $783 million (or 15%) to $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net sales of $5.4 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to an 11% increase in volume, driven by higher demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, the increased adoption of OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and increased volume across most businesses in the Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 8% due to an increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, and improved pricing for base refrigerants in our Fluoroproducts segment. These increases were partially offset by portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment, which reduced net sales by 4%.\nThe Chemours Company\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) increased by $229 million (or 5%) to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with COGS of $4.4 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher costs for certain raw materials, higher distribution, freight, and logistics expenses, and process waste water treatment costs. These increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur COGS increased by $141 million (or 3%) to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with COGS of $4.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in volume, as well as increases in costs associated with our transformation activities and higher performance-related compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impacts of portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nOur selling, general, and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $657 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with SG&A expense of $626 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the accrual of an additional estimated liability for ongoing legal matters at our Fayetteville Works site in Fayetteville, North Carolina. This increase was partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur SG&A expense decreased by $320 million (or 34%) to $626 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with SG&A expense of $946 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the 2016 accrual of $335 million in legal costs in connection with the PFOA MDL Settlement, as well as lower management and administrative expenses resulting from the sales of our Clean & Disinfect ( C&D\u201d) and Sulfur businesses in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs associated with our transformation activities, and higher performance-related compensation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expense\nOur R&D expense was largely unchanged at $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nRestructuring, Asset-related, and Other Charges\nOur restructuring, asset-related, and other charges amounted to $49 million, $57 million, and $170 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $27 million, and employee separation charges of $5 million for our 2018 restructuring program. In addition, we recognized $13 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the demolition and removal of certain unused buildings at our Chambers Works site in Deepwater, New Jersey, and an asset-related charge of $4 million for a goodwill impairment in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $32 million, and a combined $24 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges for the production shutdown at our Reactive Metals Solutions ( RMS\u201d) manufacturing site in Niagara Falls, New York, the closure of our TiO2 pigment plant in Edge Moor, Delaware, and the shutdown of certain U.S. production lines in our Fluoroproducts segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $58 million, related to the sale of our Sulfur business, $48 million, for the write-down of certain assets at our Aniline plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and $13 million, related to the sale of our corporate headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. In addition, we recognized $45 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the closure of our Edge Moor plant.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliates\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $10 million (or 30%) to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with equity in earnings of affiliates of $33 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our equity in earnings of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increased profitability for our equity method investees in the Fluoroproducts segment.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates was largely unchanged at $33 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $19 million (or 9%) to $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with interest expense, net of $214 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in both interest income and capitalized interest, the latter being attributable to ongoing progress on our OpteonTM refrigerants facility in Corpus Christi, Texas during 2018, and the construction of our new Mining Solutions facility, prior to its suspension during the first half of 2018.\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $5 million (or 2%) to $214 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with interest expense, net of $219 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to decreased interest from the repricing of our senior secured term loan in 2017, as well as lower outstanding principal amounts on the same. This decrease was partially offset by additional interest from the issuance of our 5.375% senior unsecured notes due May 2027 in 2017.\n(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a combined loss on extinguishment of debt of $38 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, and our tender offers to purchase any and all of our outstanding euro-denominated 6.125% senior unsecured notes due May 2023 and a portion of our outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated 6.625% senior unsecured notes due May 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million in connection with an amendment to our then-existing credit agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $6 million, which is the net result of a $10 million gain in connection with the open market repurchases of certain portions of our senior unsecured notes, and a $4 million loss on the write-off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the reduction in commitment on our then-existing revolving credit facility.\nOther Income, Net\nOur other income, net increased by $49 million (or 43%) to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with other income, net of $113 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a $49 million increase in miscellaneous income, which included increased EU quota authorization sales in our Fluoroproducts segment, and a $42 million gain on the sale of our Linden, New Jersey site. These increases were partially offset by decreases in royalty income and non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit income.\nOur other income, net decreased by $154 million (or 58%) to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with other income, net of $267 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our other income, net for 2017 was primarily attributable to gains of $169 million and $89 million on the sales of our C&D business and our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas during 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by a $3 million gain on favorable foreign currency movements for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a $57 million foreign currency loss due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso for the same period in 2016.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOur provisions for income taxes amounted to $159 million and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our benefit from income taxes amounted to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represented effective tax rates of 14%, 18%, and 164%, respectively.\nThe $6 million decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributable to the decreased federal corporate income tax rate under U.S. tax reform. In addition, our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $14 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $15 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits, and a net $10 million benefit from certain other provisions of U.S. tax reform. These decreases were partially offset by additional tax expense resulting from increased profitability, and the geographical mix of our earnings.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe $183 million increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with the same period in 2016, was primarily attributable to increased profitability and the geographic mix of our earnings. These increases were partially offset by $22 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $6 million benefit from the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions, and a $3 million net benefit from our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform. Our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform included tax expense associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (the Transition Tax\u201d) on our unremitted foreign earnings, a release of the valuation allowance on carryforward foreign tax credits utilized against the Transition Tax, and the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as a result of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\nSegment Reviews\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) represents our primary measure of segment performance and is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, excluding the following:\n \u2022 interest expense, depreciation, and amortization; \n \u2022 non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs, which represent the component of net periodic pension (income) costs excluding the service cost component; \n \u2022 exchange (gains) losses included in other income (expense), net; \n \u2022 restructuring, asset-related, and other charges; \n \u2022 asset impairments; \n \u2022 (gains) losses on sales of assets and businesses; and, \n \u2022 other items not considered indicative of our ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently. \nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is included in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d within this MD&A and in Note 27 - Geographic and Segment Information\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table sets forth our total Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nThe Chemours Company\nFluoroproducts\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Fluoroproducts segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Fluoroproducts segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nSegment Net Sales\nSegment net sales increased by $208 million (or 8%) to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment net sales of $2.7 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to: a 4% increase in volume, driven by the continued adoption of our OpteonTM refrigerants; a 3% increase in price, driven by improved pricing for our fluoropolymers products; and, a 1% increase to segment net sales from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nSegment net sales increased by $390 million (or 17%) to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $2.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in volume, driven by significantly stronger global demand for our OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for our fluoropolymers products, and a 1% increase in price, driven by higher average selling prices for our base refrigerants. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, lower average selling prices for our fluoropolymers products, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $114 million (or 17%) to $783 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 200 basis points to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, as well as favorable foreign currency movements and EU quota authorization sales of $67 million. These increases were partially offset by higher costs for certain raw materials, distribution expenses, and process waste water treatment costs.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $224 million (or 50%) to $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $445 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, and EU quota authorization sales of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by higher performance-related compensation expenses, and higher costs associated with our transformation activities.\nThe segment's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included $34 million and $11 million of additional costs for process waste water treatment at our Fayetteville, North Carolina site, respectively.\nChemical Solutions\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Chemical Solutions segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Chemical Solutions segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Net Sales\nSegment net sales increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $602 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment net sales of $571 million for the same period in 2017. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices across all product lines.\nSegment net sales decreased by $201 million (or 26%) to $571 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $772 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to portfolio changes resulting from the sales of the segment's C&D and Sulfur businesses, the sale of the segment's Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, and the production shutdown at the segment's RMS facility in Niagara Falls, New York, which combined, affected a 31% decrease in the segment's net sales. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in volume, and a 1% increase in price across most of the segment's remaining businesses.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7 million (or 12%) to $64 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 100 basis points to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in price.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million (or 46%) to $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $39 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% for the same period in 2016.

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net sales of $6.2 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 7% increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, improved pricing for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and higher average selling prices across all product lines in our Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 1% from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by a 1% decrease in volume, which was primarily attributable to lower demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment.\nOur net sales increased by $783 million (or 15%) to $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net sales of $5.4 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to an 11% increase in volume, driven by higher demand for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, the increased adoption of OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for fluoropolymers products in our Fluoroproducts segment, and increased volume across most businesses in the Chemical Solutions segment. In addition, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 8% due to an increase in price, driven by higher average global selling prices for Ti-PureTM TiO2 pigment in our Titanium Technologies segment, and improved pricing for base refrigerants in our Fluoroproducts segment. These increases were partially offset by portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment, which reduced net sales by 4%.\nThe Chemours Company\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) increased by $229 million (or 5%) to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with COGS of $4.4 billion for the same period in 2017. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher costs for certain raw materials, higher distribution, freight, and logistics expenses, and process waste water treatment costs. These increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur COGS increased by $141 million (or 3%) to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with COGS of $4.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in our COGS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in volume, as well as increases in costs associated with our transformation activities and higher performance-related compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impacts of portfolio changes in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nOur selling, general, and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $657 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with SG&A expense of $626 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the accrual of an additional estimated liability for ongoing legal matters at our Fayetteville Works site in Fayetteville, North Carolina. This increase was partially offset by lower costs associated with our transformation activities, and lower performance-related compensation expenses.\nOur SG&A expense decreased by $320 million (or 34%) to $626 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with SG&A expense of $946 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the 2016 accrual of $335 million in legal costs in connection with the PFOA MDL Settlement, as well as lower management and administrative expenses resulting from the sales of our Clean & Disinfect ( C&D\u201d) and Sulfur businesses in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs associated with our transformation activities, and higher performance-related compensation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expense\nOur R&D expense was largely unchanged at $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nRestructuring, Asset-related, and Other Charges\nOur restructuring, asset-related, and other charges amounted to $49 million, $57 million, and $170 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $27 million, and employee separation charges of $5 million for our 2018 restructuring program. In addition, we recognized $13 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the demolition and removal of certain unused buildings at our Chambers Works site in Deepwater, New Jersey, and an asset-related charge of $4 million for a goodwill impairment in our Chemical Solutions segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to employee separation and other charges incurred in connection with our 2017 restructuring program of $32 million, and a combined $24 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges for the production shutdown at our Reactive Metals Solutions ( RMS\u201d) manufacturing site in Niagara Falls, New York, the closure of our TiO2 pigment plant in Edge Moor, Delaware, and the shutdown of certain U.S. production lines in our Fluoroproducts segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring, asset-related, and other charges were primarily attributable to pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $58 million, related to the sale of our Sulfur business, $48 million, for the write-down of certain assets at our Aniline plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and $13 million, related to the sale of our corporate headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. In addition, we recognized $45 million in decommissioning and dismantling-related charges, primarily attributable to the closure of our Edge Moor plant.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliates\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $10 million (or 30%) to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with equity in earnings of affiliates of $33 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our equity in earnings of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increased profitability for our equity method investees in the Fluoroproducts segment.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur equity in earnings of affiliates was largely unchanged at $33 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $19 million (or 9%) to $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with interest expense, net of $214 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in both interest income and capitalized interest, the latter being attributable to ongoing progress on our OpteonTM refrigerants facility in Corpus Christi, Texas during 2018, and the construction of our new Mining Solutions facility, prior to its suspension during the first half of 2018.\nOur interest expense, net decreased by $5 million (or 2%) to $214 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with interest expense, net of $219 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to decreased interest from the repricing of our senior secured term loan in 2017, as well as lower outstanding principal amounts on the same. This decrease was partially offset by additional interest from the issuance of our 5.375% senior unsecured notes due May 2027 in 2017.\n(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a combined loss on extinguishment of debt of $38 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, and our tender offers to purchase any and all of our outstanding euro-denominated 6.125% senior unsecured notes due May 2023 and a portion of our outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated 6.625% senior unsecured notes due May 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million in connection with an amendment to our then-existing credit agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $6 million, which is the net result of a $10 million gain in connection with the open market repurchases of certain portions of our senior unsecured notes, and a $4 million loss on the write-off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the reduction in commitment on our then-existing revolving credit facility.\nOther Income, Net\nOur other income, net increased by $49 million (or 43%) to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with other income, net of $113 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in our other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a $49 million increase in miscellaneous income, which included increased EU quota authorization sales in our Fluoroproducts segment, and a $42 million gain on the sale of our Linden, New Jersey site. These increases were partially offset by decreases in royalty income and non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit income.\nOur other income, net decreased by $154 million (or 58%) to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with other income, net of $267 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our other income, net for 2017 was primarily attributable to gains of $169 million and $89 million on the sales of our C&D business and our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas during 2016, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by a $3 million gain on favorable foreign currency movements for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a $57 million foreign currency loss due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso for the same period in 2016.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOur provisions for income taxes amounted to $159 million and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our benefit from income taxes amounted to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represented effective tax rates of 14%, 18%, and 164%, respectively.\nThe $6 million decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, when compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributable to the decreased federal corporate income tax rate under U.S. tax reform. In addition, our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $14 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $15 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits, and a net $10 million benefit from certain other provisions of U.S. tax reform. These decreases were partially offset by additional tax expense resulting from increased profitability, and the geographical mix of our earnings.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe $183 million increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared with the same period in 2016, was primarily attributable to increased profitability and the geographic mix of our earnings. These increases were partially offset by $22 million in windfall benefit from our share-based payments, a $6 million benefit from the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions, and a $3 million net benefit from our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform. Our provisional estimates for U.S. tax reform included tax expense associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (the Transition Tax\u201d) on our unremitted foreign earnings, a release of the valuation allowance on carryforward foreign tax credits utilized against the Transition Tax, and the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as a result of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\nSegment Reviews\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) represents our primary measure of segment performance and is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, excluding the following:\n \u2022 interest expense, depreciation, and amortization; \n \u2022 non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs, which represent the component of net periodic pension (income) costs excluding the service cost component; \n \u2022 exchange (gains) losses included in other income (expense), net;

The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to: a 4% increase in volume, driven by the continued adoption of our OpteonTM refrigerants; a 3% increase in price, driven by improved pricing for our fluoropolymers products; and, a 1% increase to segment net sales from favorable foreign currency movements. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nSegment net sales increased by $390 million (or 17%) to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $2.3 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 16% increase in volume, driven by significantly stronger global demand for our OpteonTM refrigerants and higher demand for our fluoropolymers products, and a 1% increase in price, driven by higher average selling prices for our base refrigerants. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices for our OpteonTM refrigerants due to expected automotive contractual price declines, lower average selling prices for our fluoropolymers products, and lower volume for our base refrigerants due to the phase-down of legacy refrigerants.\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $114 million (or 17%) to $783 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 200 basis points to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, as well as favorable foreign currency movements and EU quota authorization sales of $67 million. These increases were partially offset by higher costs for certain raw materials, distribution expenses, and process waste water treatment costs.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $224 million (or 50%) to $669 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $445 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in volume and price, and EU quota authorization sales of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by higher performance-related compensation expenses, and higher costs associated with our transformation activities.\nThe segment's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included $34 million and $11 million of additional costs for process waste water treatment at our Fayetteville, North Carolina site, respectively.\nChemical Solutions\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Chemical Solutions segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Chemical Solutions segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in segment net sales from prior period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio/other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change in segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Chemours Company\nSegment Net Sales\nSegment net sales increased by $31 million (or 5%) to $602 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment net sales of $571 million for the same period in 2017. The increase to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices across all product lines.\nSegment net sales decreased by $201 million (or 26%) to $571 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment net sales of $772 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease to segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to portfolio changes resulting from the sales of the segment's C&D and Sulfur businesses, the sale of the segment's Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, and the production shutdown at the segment's RMS facility in Niagara Falls, New York, which combined, affected a 31% decrease in the segment's net sales. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in volume, and a 1% increase in price across most of the segment's remaining businesses.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7 million (or 12%) to $64 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 100 basis points to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% for the same period in 2017. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in price.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million (or 46%) to $57 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by approximately 500 basis points to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of $39 million and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% for the same period in 2016. The increases to segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to cost reductions from the aforementioned portfolio changes, as well as increases in volume and price for the segment's remaining businesses.\nTitanium Technologies\nThe following chart sets forth the net sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounts for our Titanium Technologies segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Chemours Company\nThe following table sets forth the impacts of price, volume, currency, and portfolio and/or other changes on our Titanium Technologies segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and"}
