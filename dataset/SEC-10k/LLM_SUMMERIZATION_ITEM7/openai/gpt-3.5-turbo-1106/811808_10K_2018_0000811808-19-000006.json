Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report contains comments or information that constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as expects\u201d, anticipates\u201d, believes\u201d, estimates\u201d and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will\u201d, should\u201d, would\u201d and could\u201d are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 indicates that the disclosure of forward-looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by us. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially. Factors that might cause such a difference include changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships; demand for products and services; the degree of competition by traditional and non-traditional competitors; changes in banking laws and regulations; changes in tax laws; the impact of technological advances; the outcomes of contingencies; trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans; and changes in the national and local economy.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nWe are a $2.20 billion community-based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our three operating segments: community banking, trust and wealth management and insurance. Our community bank, Summit Community Bank, Inc. has a total of 33 banking offices located in West Virginia and Virginia. Our trust and wealth management division offers trust services and other non-bank financial products principally within our community bank's market area. In addition, we also operate Summit Insurance Services, LLC in Moorefield, West Virginia and Leesburg, Virginia, which provides insurance brokerage services to individuals and businesses covering corporate and personal property and casualty insurance products, as well as group health and life insurance products and consulting services. See Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information. Summit Financial Group, Inc. employs approximately 371 full time equivalent employees.\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits. Business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence, as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace.\nKey Items in 2018\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our earnings per diluted share increased from $1.00 in 2017 to $2.26 in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our return on average equity and return on average tangible equity increased from 6.40% to 13.43% and 8.01% to 16.09%, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2018 net income was $28.07 million ($2.26 per diluted share) compared to $11.92 million ($1.00 per diluted share) in 2017. 2017 earnings were negatively impacted by a $9.9 million (or $6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge and a $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) tax charge due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in 2018, principally due to a 37 basis point increase in funding costs compared to a 21 basis point increase in our yield on interest earning assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net revenues increased $6.6 million, or 8.2 percent during 2018 primarily as result of the First Century Bankshares, Inc.

Our solid lending activity and strong core operating performance of the past year offer significant evidence of our progress. In addition, our acquisition strategy continued to present us with significant opportunities for ongoing performance enhancement. Looking forward to 2019, while we could be challenged by a variety of potential economic uncertainties, we anticipate sustaining our recent positive trends with respect to: revenue growth, loan portfolio growth, a relatively stable net interest margin, low overhead, and reductions in overall levels of problem assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the other disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined.\nBased on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of goodwill, fair value measurements, accounting for acquired loans and deferred tax assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods. Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Asset Quality section of this financial review.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is subject to an analysis by reporting unit at least annually by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine whether write-downs of the recorded balances are necessary. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value.\nWe cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. See Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets, which include goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements: Fair value is based upon the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, including, but not limited to, property held for sale, impaired loans and derivatives. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with a three-level hierarchy (e.g., Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) . Fair value determination\nrequires that we make a number of significant judgments. In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. We do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses. These modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance.\nFair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes.\nAccounting for Acquired Loans: Loans acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The fair value of the acquired loans are based on the present value of the expected cash flows, including principal, interest and prepayments. Periodic principal and interest cash flows are adjusted for expected losses and prepayments, then discounted to determine the present value and summed to arrive at the estimated fair value. Fair value estimates involve assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAcquired loans are divided into loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration (acquired impaired) and loans that do not meet this criteria (acquired performing). Acquired impaired loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. In the assessment of credit quality, numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments must be made, based on internal and third-party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected. This is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we continue to estimate the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected on acquired impaired loans. Increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and/or a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield, which will be recognized prospectively. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor acquired performing loans, the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a loan's cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to interest income over the loan's remaining life using the level yield method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans.\nSee Note 3 and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquired loans.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nWe are organized and managed along three major business segments, as described in Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business. Net income by segment follows:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Community banking\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust and wealth management\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance services\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent\n</td> <td>(1,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEarnings Summary\nNet income increased 135.6% during 2018 to $28.1 million, compared to $11.9 million in 2017, which was 31.1% less than 2016's $17.3 million. Net income was $2.26, $1.00 and $1.61 per diluted share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a 126.0% increase in 2018 and a 37.9% decrease in 2017. Return on average equity was 13.43% in 2018 compared to 6.40% in 2017 and 11.53% in 2016. Return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.32% compared to 0.59% in 2017 and 1.08% in 2016.\nIncluded in 2017's net income were a $9.9 million pre-tax ($6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge, $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) preliminary income tax charge due to enactment of the TCJA, and $1.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) of merger related expenses. A summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion.\n2018 net income was positively impacted by higher net interest income of $3.7 million (or $0.29 per diluted share), $790,000 growth in trust and wealth management fees ($0.06 per diluted share), $522,000 increased deposit account-related fees ($0.08 per diluted share) and $2.6 million ($0.25 per diluted share) in lower income tax expense as result of TCJA's lower income tax rates. Excluding 2017's litigation charge, higher total noninterest expense of $2.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share) partially offset these positive impacts.\nNet Interest Income\nThe major component of our net earnings is net interest income, which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in volume, resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet's composition, fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds. We seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components. This is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions, while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level.\nNet interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis, average balance sheet amounts and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years 2014 through 2018 are presented in Table I. Table II presents, for the periods indicated, the changes in interest income and expense attributable to (a) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate) and (b) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior period volume). Changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.\nNet interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis totaled $71.1 million, $68.6 million and $50.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of 3.7% in 2018 and 35.5% in 2017. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased.\nDuring 2018, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $9.7 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $7.2 million due to higher cost of funds.\nDuring 2017, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $21.3 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $3.3 million due to higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nDuring 2016, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $5.3 million as the increase in earnings due to higher volumes, primarily loans, more than offset reductions in yield, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $2.2 million primarily due to both higher cost of funds, principally on short-term borrowings, and higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nTotal average earning assets increased 6.4% to $1.99 billion for 2018 from $1.87 billion in 2017. Total average interest bearing liabilities increased 5.2% to $1.69 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2017.\nOur net interest margin was 3.57% for 2018 compared to 3.67% and 3.39% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net interest margin decreased 10 basis points during 2018 as the cost of funds increased 37 basis points while yields on interest earning assets increased 21 basis points. The 2018 increase in yields on interest earning assets was negatively impacted by lower taxable equivalent adjustments to interest earned on tax-exempt securities and loans as a result of enactment of the TCJA in late\n2017, which lowered our statutory corporate Federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, from 35% to 21%. Our net interest margin increased 28 basis points in 2017 primarily due to the 25 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. See Tables I and II for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our net interest income.\nAssuming no significant unanticipated changes in market interest rates, we expect growth in our net interest income to continue over the near term primarily due to continuing expected growth in earning assets, primarily loans. We continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact.\nSee the Market Risk Management\u201d section for discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us. Further analysis of our yields on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented in Tables I and II below.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

merit increases and the increased average number of annual full-time equivalent employees related to the FCB acquisition in Q2 2017. These expenses are 28% higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to general merit increases and an increase in our average annual full-time equivalent employees, primarily those in conjunction with the FCB and HCB acquisitions.\nNet occupancy expense: The 43.5% increase in 2017 is primarily due to the acquired FCB locations.\nEquipment: The 2017 increase in equipment expense is primarily increased depreciation and amortization related to various technological upgrades, both hardware and software, made during the past two years and also the FCB acquisition.\nAmortization of intangibles: Amortization of intangibles increased during 2018 and 2017 as a result of the additional amortization of the core deposit intangibles associated with the FCB and HCB acquisitions.\nFDIC premiums: FDIC premiums decreased 22% during 2018 primarily due to improvement in earnings and performance. FDIC premiums increased 21.7% during 2017 as a result of the significant increase in our balance sheet due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower premium rates caused by the FDIC's change in the factors used to compute its deposit insurance rates, effective the second half of 2016. These lower effective premium rates are expected to continue.\nMerger-related expense: These 2017 and 2016 expenses are comprised of data processing conversion costs, employee severance costs, write-downs of equipment and legal fees related to the FCB and HCB acquisitions. Such costs are expected to approximate $500,000 in 2019 relative to the Peoples acquisition.\nForeclosed properties expense, net of gains/losses: Foreclosed properties expense, net of gains/losses increased for 2017 as a result of higher repairs and maintenance of foreclosed properties, as well as the expenses attributable to the properties acquired in conjunction with the FCB acquisition and 2016 also included gains of $1.1 million related to sales of lots in two foreclosed residential subdivisions.\nLitigation settlement: During 2017, we recorded a $9.9 million pre-tax charge as full resolution of the ResCap Litigation which had been pending since 2014. See the Legal Contingencies section of Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOther: Other expenses increased $2.1 million during 2017 primarily due to increased general operating costs due to the acquisitions of FCB and HCB.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $7.0 million, $9.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Our effective tax rate (income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 20.0%, 44.8% and 31.6%, respectively. The 2018 decreased effective tax rate is due to the lower corporate income tax rates\nenacted late 2017 in conjunction with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d), which permanently lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles required companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, including those accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income, as of the date of TCJA's enactment and record the effects as income tax expense in the reporting period of enactment. We remeasured our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 22, 2017, at the new federal corporate income tax rate of 21%, and recorded additional income tax expense of $3.5 million to reduce our net deferred tax assets, thus causing a higher effective tax rate for 2017. Refer to Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information and additional discussion of the significant components influencing our effective income tax rates.\nCHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION\nOur average assets increased during 2018 to $2.13 billion, an increase of 6.1% above 2017's average of $2.01 billion, and our year end December 31, 2018 assets were $66.3 million more than December 31, 2017. Average assets increased 25.4% in 2017, from $1.60 billion in 2016. Significant changes in the components of our balance sheet in 2018 and 2017 are discussed below.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

A continued improving economic environment in our market area contributed to 5.1% organic\nloan growth, excluding mortgage warehouse lines, which increased $8.4 million in 2018, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio, following 2017's growth of 9.6% and 2016's growth of 7.9%.\nRefer to Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our loan maturities and a discussion of our adjustable rate loans as of December 31, 2018.\nIn the normal course of business, we make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities, which are disclosed in Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements but not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in these types of commitments and contingent liabilities and we do not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments.\nSecurities\nSecurities comprised approximately 13.3% of total assets at December 31, 2018 compared to 15.4% at December 31, 2017. Average securities approximated $307.8 million for 2018 or 6.7% less than 2017's average of $329.9 million. The $38.6 million decrease in securities during 2018 was used to fund loan growth. In 2017, we obtained $100.7 million of available for sale securities in the FCB acquisition; the portfolio was restructured by selling $94 million of those securities and only $54 million of the proceeds were reinvested.

We use this line primarily to fund loans to customers. Funds acquired through this program are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet in short-term borrowings or long-term borrowings, depending on the repayment terms of the debt agreement. We also had $159.3 million available on a short term line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2018, which is primarily secured by consumer loans, construction loans and commercial and industrial loans and a $6 million available line of credit with a correspondent bank.\nShort-term Borrowings: Total short-term borrowings consisting primarily of advances from the FHLB having original maturities of 30 days or less increased $58.6 million from $250.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $309.1 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding our short-term borrowings.\nLong-term Borrowings: Long-term borrowings historically have been used to fund our loan growth, however, as a result of prolonged low short-term interest rates following the economic downturn of 2008, long-term borrowings have been reduced significantly as we have replaced maturing long-term borrowings with short-term funding. Total long-term borrowings of $735,000 at December 31, 2018 consisted of a long-term FHLB advance and the $45.8 million at December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of structured repurchase agreements with unaffiliated institutions, which matured in 2018. Long-term borrowings from the FHLB totaled $751,000 at December 31, 2017. During 2007, we entered into $110 million of structured repurchase agreements, with terms ranging from 5 to 10 years and call features ranging from 2 to 3.5 years in which they are callable by\nthe purchaser. These structured repurchase agreements totaled $45.0 million at December 31, 2017 and matured during 2018. Refer to Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long-term borrowings.\nASSET QUALITY\nFor purposes of this discussion, we define nonperforming assets to include foreclosed properties, other repossessed assets and nonperforming loans, which is comprised of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest and nonaccrual loans. Performing troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") are excluded from nonperforming loans.\nTable XI presents a summary of nonperforming assets at December 31, as follows:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>

to Note 7 for information regarding our past due loans, impaired loans, nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings.\nWe monitor our concentrations in higher-risk lending areas in accordance with the Interagency Guidance for Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending issued in 2006. This guidance establishes concentration guidelines of 100% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction, land development and other land loans. It further establishes a guideline of 300% of Tier 1 Capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction, land development and other land loans plus loans secured by non-owner occupied non-farm non-residential properties. As of December 31, 2018, Summit Community Bank was within the recommended limits of 100% and 300%, respectively.\nWe maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is comprised of three distinct reserve components: (1) specific reserves related to\nloans individually evaluated, (2) quantitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated and (3) qualitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated. A summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis with respect to each of these components in order to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is provided in Note 8 of the accompanying financial statements.\nRelationship between Allowance for Loan Losses, Net Charge-offs and Nonperforming Loans\nIn analyzing the relationship among the allowance for loan losses, net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans, it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as the probability of collection changes over time. Allowances are established at origination through the quantitative and qualitative assessment process discussed above based upon credit quality.\nCharge-offs, if necessary, are typically recognized in a period after the allowances were established. If the previously established allowance exceeds that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit, a reduction in the overall level of the allowance could be recognized. In summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence consists of periods of expense recognition, followed by periods of charge-offs.\nConsumer loans are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy. For example, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier. Residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes 180 days past due. Other consumer loans, if collateralized, are generally charged off to net realizable value at 120 days past due.\nCommercial-related loans (which are risk-rated) are charged to the allowance for loan losses when the loss has been confirmed. This determination includes many factors, including among others, the prioritization of our claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower's equity.\nSubstantially all of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate. The majority of these loans were underwritten in accordance with our loan-to-value policy guidelines which range from 70-85% at the time of origination. Although $8.0 million of our nonperforming loans have a related allowance of $1.5 million, the fair values of the underlying collateral value or the discounted cash flows remain in excess of the recorded investment in many of our nonperforming loans and therefore, no specific allocation of the allowance is required.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, our allowance for loan losses totaled $13.0 million, or 0.77% of total loans and $12.6 million, or 0.78% of total loans, respectively. If the acquired FCB and HCB loans are excluded, the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio at December 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been 0.84% and 0.91%, respectively. The allowance for loan losses is considered adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nTable XII presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses

result of foreclosure proceedings. Although foreclosed property is recorded at the lower of investment in the real estate or fair value less estimated costs to sell, the prices ultimately realized upon their sale may or may not result in us recognizing additional loss.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBank Liquidity: Liquidity reflects our ability to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals, as well as provide for other transactional requirements. Liquidity is provided primarily by excess funds at correspondent banks, non-pledged securities and available lines of credit with the FHLB, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and correspondent banks, which totaled approximately $871.4 million or 39.6% of total consolidated assets at December 31, 2018.\nOur liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short- and medium-term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity. As a member of the FHLB, we have access to borrow approximately $767.5 million. At December 31, 2018, we had available borrowing capacity of $462.8 million on our FHLB line. We also maintain a credit line with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond as a contingency liquidity vehicle. The amount available on this line at December 31, 2018 was approximately $159 million, which is secured by a pledge of our consumer loans, construction loans and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. We have a $6 million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank. Also, we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises. During 2018, our loan growth was funded primarily by mortgage backed securities paydowns and deposits as our loans increased approximately $88.7 million, while securities decreased $35.4 million and total deposits increased $34.2 million.\nLiquidity risk represents the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues, customer or creditor perception of financial strength and events unrelated to Summit such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. The Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), comprised of members of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors, oversees our liquidity risk management process. The ALCO develops and recommends policies and limits governing our liquidity to the Board of\nDirectors for approval with the objective of ensuring that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations, as well as maintain sufficient levels of on-hand liquidity, under both normal and stressed\u201d circumstances.\nOne aspect of our liquidity management process is establishing contingent liquidity funding plans under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages or events. The following represents three stressed\u201d liquidity circumstances and our related contingency plans with respect to each.\nScenario 1 - Summit Community's capital status becomes less than well capitalized\u201d. Banks which are less than well capitalized\u201d in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines are prohibited from issuing new brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC to do so. In the event Summit Community's capital status were to fall below well capitalized and was not successful in obtaining the FDIC's waiver to issue new brokered deposits, Summit Community:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would have limited amounts of maturing brokered deposits to replace in the short-term, as we have limited our brokered deposits maturing in any one quarter to no more than $50 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Presently has $871 million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon to fund maturing brokered deposits until Summit Community had restored its capital to well capitalized status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would first seek to restore its capital to well capitalized status through capital contributions from Summit, its parent holding company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would generally have no more than $100 million in brokered deposits maturing in any one year time frame, which is well within its presently available sources of liquid funds, if in the event Summit does not have the capital resources to restore Summit Community's capital to well capitalized status. One year would give Summit Community ample time to raise alternative funds either through retail deposits or the sale of assets and obtain capital resources to restore it to well capitalized status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Scenario 2 - Summit Community's credit quality deteriorates such that the FHLB restricts further advances. If in the event that the Bank's credit quality deteriorated to the point that further advances under its line with the FHLB were restricted, Summit Community:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would severely curtail lending and other growth activities until such time as access to this line could be restored, thus eliminating the need for net new advances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would still have available current liquid funding sources secured by unemcumbered loans and securities totaling $468 million aside from its FHLB line, which would result in a funding source of approximately $366 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Scenario 3 - A competitive financial institution offers a retail deposit program at interest rates significantly above current market rates in Summit Community's market areas. If a competitive financial institution offered a retail deposit program at rates well in excess of current market rates in Summit Community's market area, the Bank:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Presently has $871 million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon immediately to fund any net run off\u201d of deposits from this activity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would severely curtail lending and other growth activities so as to preserve the availability of as much contingency funds as possible.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Would begin offering its own competitive deposit program when deemed prudent so as to restore the retail deposits lost to the competition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day-to-day as well as anticipated funding needs are met. We are not aware of any trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity. Refer to page 13 of Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of our liquidity risk.\nGrowth and Expansion: During 2018, we spent approximately $5.5 million on capital expenditures for premises and equipment. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $7 - $8 million in 2019, primarily for new branch sites and construction and equipment and technological upgrades.\nAbsent an acquisition, management anticipates 5-6% organic asset growth in 2019.\nCapital Compliance: Our capital position is strong. Stated as a percentage of total assets, our equity ratio was 10.0% at December 31, 2018 compared to 9.4% at December 31, 2017. Our subsidiary bank, Summit Community Bank, had Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage capital in excess of the minimum well capitalized\u201d levels of $71.3 million, $49.7 million and $107.0 million, respectively. We intend to maintain both Summit's and its subsidiary bank's capital ratios at levels\nthat would be considered to be well capitalized\u201d in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines. See Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulatory capital.\nDuring 2018, we retained $21.5 million of earnings and the net change in accumulated other comprehensive income was $2.7 million, principally resulting from $3.7 million unrealized net losses on securities available for sale and $1.2 million in net gains on cash flow hedges.\nOn July 30, 2015, our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") purchased 225,000 shares of Summit Financial Group Inc. common stock, which is shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity, similar to a purchase of treasury stock. When the shares are committed to be released and become available for allocation to plan participants, the then fair value of such shares will be charged to compensation expense. Unallocated shares owned by the Company's ESOP are not considered to be outstanding for the purpose of computing earnings per share.\nDividends: Cash dividends per share totaled $0.53 and $0.44 during 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing dividend payout ratios of 23.3% and 44.0%, respectively. It is our intention to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis during 2019. Future dividend amounts will depend on the earnings and financial condition of our subsidiary bank as well as general economic conditions.\nThe primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary bank. Dividends paid by our subsidiary bank are subject to restrictions by banking law and regulations and require approval by the bank's regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank's current year's net income, as defined, plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years. In addition, cash dividends depend on the earnings and financial condition of our subsidiary bank and our capital adequacy as well as general economic conditions. During 2019, the net retained profits available for distribution to Summit as dividends without regulatory approval are approximately $25.6 million.\nContractual Cash Obligations: During our normal course of business, we incur contractual cash obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report contains comments or information that constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as expects\u201d, anticipates\u201d, believes\u201d, estimates\u201d and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will\u201d, should\u201d, would\u201d and could\u201d are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 indicates that the disclosure of forward-looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by us. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially. Factors that might cause such a difference include changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships; demand for products and services; the degree of competition by traditional and non-traditional competitors; changes in banking laws and regulations; changes in tax laws; the impact of technological advances; the outcomes of contingencies; trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans; and changes in the national and local economy.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nWe are a $2.20 billion community-based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our three operating segments: community banking, trust and wealth management and insurance. Our community bank, Summit Community Bank, Inc. has a total of 33 banking offices located in West Virginia and Virginia. Our trust and wealth management division offers trust services and other non-bank financial products principally within our community bank's market area. In addition, we also operate Summit Insurance Services, LLC in Moorefield, West Virginia and Leesburg, Virginia, which provides insurance brokerage services to individuals and businesses covering corporate and personal property and casualty insurance products, as well as group health and life insurance products and consulting services. See Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information. Summit Financial Group, Inc. employs approximately 371 full time equivalent employees.\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits. Business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence, as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace.\nKey Items in 2018\n \u2022 Our earnings per diluted share increased from $1.00 in 2017 to $2.26 in 2018. \n \u2022 Our return on average equity and return on average tangible equity increased from 6.40% to 13.43% and 8.01% to 16.09%, respectively. \n \u2022 2018 net income was $28.07 million ($2.26 per diluted share) compared to $11.92 million ($1.00 per diluted share) in 2017. 2017 earnings were negatively impacted by a $9.9 million (or $6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge and a $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) tax charge due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). \n \u2022 Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in 2018, principally due to a 37 basis point increase in funding costs compared to a 21 basis point increase in our yield on interest earning assets. \n \u2022 Net revenues increased $6.6 million, or 8.2 percent during 2018 primarily as result of the First Century Bankshares, Inc. (\"FCB\") acquisition. \n \u2022 We achieved loan growth, excluding mortgage warehouse lines of credit, of 5.1 percent, or $80.4 million during 2018. \n \u2022 Nonperforming assets declined to their lowest level since 2008, representing 1.66 percent of total assets at year end 2018 compared to 1.73 percent at the prior year end. \n \u2022 During 2018, provisions for loan losses increased by $1.0 million, primarily due to higher levels of loan net charge-offs during 2018 and loan growth. \n \u2022 Cash dividends paid on our common stock in 2018 totaled $0.53 per share compared to $0.44 paid per share in 2017. \n \u2022 On July 24, 2018, we entered into a Definitive Merger Agreement with Mullens, West Virginia-based Peoples Bankshares, Inc. (\"Peoples\") and its subsidiary, First Peoples Bank. The transaction closed on January 1, 2019. At consummation, Peoples had total assets of $133.1 million, loans of $42.3 million and deposits of $112.9 million. \nOUTLOOK\nThe year just concluded represents another significant milestone relative to Summit's goal to be a consistent growth, high-performing community banking institution. Our solid lending activity and strong core operating performance of the past year offer significant evidence of our progress. In addition, our acquisition strategy continued to present us with significant opportunities for ongoing performance enhancement. Looking forward to 2019, while we could be challenged by a variety of potential economic uncertainties, we anticipate sustaining our recent positive trends with respect to: revenue growth, loan portfolio growth, a relatively stable net interest margin, low overhead, and reductions in overall levels of problem assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the other disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined.\nBased on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of goodwill, fair value measurements, accounting for acquired loans and deferred tax assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods. Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Asset Quality section of this financial review.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is subject to an analysis by reporting unit at least annually by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine whether write-downs of the recorded balances are necessary. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value.\nWe cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. See Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets, which include goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements: Fair value is based upon the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, including, but not limited to, property held for sale, impaired loans and derivatives. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with a three-level hierarchy (e.g., Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) . Fair value determination\nrequires that we make a number of significant judgments. In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. We do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses. These modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance.\nFair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes.\nAccounting for Acquired Loans: Loans acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The fair value of the acquired loans are based on the present value of the expected cash flows, including principal, interest and prepayments. Periodic principal and interest cash flows are adjusted for expected losses and prepayments, then discounted to determine the present value and summed to arrive at the estimated fair value. Fair value estimates involve assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAcquired loans are divided into loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration (acquired impaired) and loans that do not meet this criteria (acquired performing). Acquired impaired loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. In the assessment of credit quality, numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments must be made, based on internal and third-party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected. This is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we continue to estimate the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected on acquired impaired loans. Increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and/or a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield, which will be recognized prospectively. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor acquired performing loans, the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a loan's cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to interest income over the loan's remaining life using the level yield method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans.\nSee Note 3 and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquired loans.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nWe are organized and managed along three major business segments, as described in Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business. Net income by segment follows:\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEarnings Summary\nNet income increased 135.6% during 2018 to $28.1 million, compared to $11.9 million in 2017, which was 31.1% less than 2016's $17.3 million. Net income was $2.26, $1.00 and $1.61 per diluted share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a 126.0% increase in 2018 and a 37.9% decrease in 2017. Return on average equity was 13.43% in 2018 compared to 6.40% in 2017 and 11.53% in 2016. Return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.32% compared to 0.59% in 2017 and 1.08% in 2016.\nIncluded in 2017's net income were a $9.9 million pre-tax ($6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge, $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) preliminary income tax charge due to enactment of the TCJA, and $1.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) of merger related expenses. A summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion.\n2018 net income was positively impacted by higher net interest income of $3.7 million (or $0.29 per diluted share), $790,000 growth in trust and wealth management fees ($0.06 per diluted share), $522,000 increased deposit account-related fees ($0.08 per diluted share) and $2.6 million ($0.25 per diluted share) in lower income tax expense as result of TCJA's lower income tax rates. Excluding 2017's litigation charge, higher total noninterest expense of $2.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share) partially offset these positive impacts.\nNet Interest Income\nThe major component of our net earnings is net interest income, which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in volume, resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet's composition, fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds. We seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components. This is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions, while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level.\nNet interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis, average balance sheet amounts and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years 2014 through 2018 are presented in Table I. Table II presents, for the periods indicated, the changes in interest income and expense attributable to (a) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate) and (b) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior period volume). Changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.\nNet interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis totaled $71.1 million, $68.6 million and $50.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of 3.7% in 2018 and 35.5% in 2017. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased.\nDuring 2018, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $9.7 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $7.2 million due to higher cost of funds.\nDuring 2017, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $21.3 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $3.3 million due to higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nDuring 2016, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $5.3 million as the increase in earnings due to higher volumes, primarily loans, more than offset reductions in yield, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $2.2 million primarily due to both higher cost of funds, principally on short-term borrowings, and higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nTotal average earning assets increased 6.4% to $1.99 billion for 2018 from $1.87 billion in 2017. Total average interest bearing liabilities increased 5.2% to $1.69 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $1.60 billion at December 31, 2017.\nOur net interest margin was 3.57% for 2018 compared to 3.67% and 3.39% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net interest margin decreased 10 basis points during 2018 as the cost of funds increased 37 basis points while yields on interest earning assets increased 21 basis points. The 2018 increase in yields on interest earning assets was negatively impacted by lower taxable equivalent adjustments to interest earned on tax-exempt securities and loans as a result of enactment of the TCJA in late\n2017, which lowered our statutory corporate Federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, from 35% to 21%. Our net interest margin increased 28 basis points in 2017 primarily due to the 25 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. See Tables I and II for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our net interest income.\nAssuming no significant unanticipated changes in market interest rates, we expect growth in our net interest income to continue over the near term primarily due to continuing expected growth in earning assets, primarily loans. We continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact.\nSee the Market Risk Management\u201d section for discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us. Further analysis of our yields on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented in Tables I and II below.\n\n (1) For purposes of this table, nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances. Included in interest and fees on loans are loan fees of $839,000, $998,000 and $528,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) For purposes of this table, interest income on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted assuming a Federal tax rate of 21% for 2018 , 35% for 2017 and 34% for all other years presented. The taxable equivalent adjustment results in an increase in interest income of $1,280,000, $2,413,000, $1,589,000, $1,542,000 and $1,465,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. \n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report contains comments or information that constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as expects\u201d, anticipates\u201d, believes\u201d, estimates\u201d and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will\u201d, should\u201d, would\u201d and could\u201d are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 indicates that the disclosure of forward-looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by us. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially. Factors that might cause such a difference include changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships; demand for products and services; the degree of competition by traditional and non-traditional competitors; changes in banking laws and regulations; changes in tax laws; the impact of technological advances; the outcomes of contingencies; trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans; and changes in the national and local economy.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nWe are a $2.20 billion community-based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our three operating segments: community banking, trust and wealth management and insurance. Our community bank, Summit Community Bank, Inc. has a total of 33 banking offices located in West Virginia and Virginia. Our trust and wealth management division offers trust services and other non-bank financial products principally within our community bank's market area. In addition, we also operate Summit Insurance Services, LLC in Moorefield, West Virginia and Leesburg, Virginia, which provides insurance brokerage services to individuals and businesses covering corporate and personal property and casualty insurance products, as well as group health and life insurance products and consulting services. See Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information. Summit Financial Group, Inc. employs approximately 371 full time equivalent employees.\nOVERVIEW\nOur primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits. Business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence, as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace.\nKey Items in 2018\n \u2022 Our earnings per diluted share increased from $1.00 in 2017 to $2.26 in 2018. \n \u2022 Our return on average equity and return on average tangible equity increased from 6.40% to 13.43% and 8.01% to 16.09%, respectively. \n \u2022 2018 net income was $28.07 million ($2.26 per diluted share) compared to $11.92 million ($1.00 per diluted share) in 2017. 2017 earnings were negatively impacted by a $9.9 million (or $6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge and a $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) tax charge due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). \n \u2022 Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in 2018, principally due to a 37 basis point increase in funding costs compared to a 21 basis point increase in our yield on interest earning assets. \n \u2022 Net revenues increased $6.6 million, or 8.2 percent during 2018 primarily as result of the First Century Bankshares, Inc. (\"FCB\") acquisition. \n \u2022 We achieved loan growth, excluding mortgage warehouse lines of credit, of 5.1 percent, or $80.4 million during 2018. \n \u2022 Nonperforming assets declined to their lowest level since 2008, representing 1.66 percent of total assets at year end 2018 compared to 1.73 percent at the prior year end. \n \u2022 During 2018, provisions for loan losses increased by $1.0 million, primarily due to higher levels of loan net charge-offs during 2018 and loan growth. \n \u2022 Cash dividends paid on our common stock in 2018 totaled $0.53 per share compared to $0.44 paid per share in 2017. \n \u2022 On July 24, 2018, we entered into a Definitive Merger Agreement with Mullens, West Virginia-based Peoples Bankshares, Inc. (\"Peoples\") and its subsidiary, First Peoples Bank. The transaction closed on January 1, 2019. At consummation, Peoples had total assets of $133.1 million, loans of $42.3 million and deposits of $112.9 million. \nOUTLOOK\nThe year just concluded represents another significant milestone relative to Summit's goal to be a consistent growth, high-performing community banking institution. Our solid lending activity and strong core operating performance of the past year offer significant evidence of our progress. In addition, our acquisition strategy continued to present us with significant opportunities for ongoing performance enhancement. Looking forward to 2019, while we could be challenged by a variety of potential economic uncertainties, we anticipate sustaining our recent positive trends with respect to: revenue growth, loan portfolio growth, a relatively stable net interest margin, low overhead, and reductions in overall levels of problem assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the other disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined.\nBased on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of goodwill, fair value measurements, accounting for acquired loans and deferred tax assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods. Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Asset Quality section of this financial review.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is subject to an analysis by reporting unit at least annually by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine whether write-downs of the recorded balances are necessary. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value.\nWe cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. See Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets, which include goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements: Fair value is based upon the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, including, but not limited to, property held for sale, impaired loans and derivatives. Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with a three-level hierarchy (e.g., Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) . Fair value determination\nrequires that we make a number of significant judgments. In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. We do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses. These modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance.\nFair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes.\nAccounting for Acquired Loans: Loans acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The fair value of the acquired loans are based on the present value of the expected cash flows, including principal, interest and prepayments. Periodic principal and interest cash flows are adjusted for expected losses and prepayments, then discounted to determine the present value and summed to arrive at the estimated fair value. Fair value estimates involve assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAcquired loans are divided into loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration (acquired impaired) and loans that do not meet this criteria (acquired performing). Acquired impaired loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. In the assessment of credit quality, numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments must be made, based on internal and third-party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected. This is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, we continue to estimate the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected on acquired impaired loans. Increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and/or a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference to accretable yield, which will be recognized prospectively. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\nFor acquired performing loans, the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a loan's cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to interest income over the loan's remaining life using the level yield method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans.\nSee Note 3 and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquired loans.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nWe are organized and managed along three major business segments, as described in Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business.

Net income was $2.26, $1.00 and $1.61 per diluted share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a 126.0% increase in 2018 and a 37.9% decrease in 2017. Return on average equity was 13.43% in 2018 compared to 6.40% in 2017 and 11.53% in 2016. Return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.32% compared to 0.59% in 2017 and 1.08% in 2016.\nIncluded in 2017's net income were a $9.9 million pre-tax ($6.2 million after-tax or $0.52 per diluted share) litigation settlement charge, $3.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) preliminary income tax charge due to enactment of the TCJA, and $1.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) of merger related expenses. A summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion.\n2018 net income was positively impacted by higher net interest income of $3.7 million (or $0.29 per diluted share), $790,000 growth in trust and wealth management fees ($0.06 per diluted share), $522,000 increased deposit account-related fees ($0.08 per diluted share) and $2.6 million ($0.25 per diluted share) in lower income tax expense as result of TCJA's lower income tax rates. Excluding 2017's litigation charge, higher total noninterest expense of $2.0 million ($0.16 per diluted share) partially offset these positive impacts.\nNet Interest Income\nThe major component of our net earnings is net interest income, which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in volume, resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet's composition, fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased.\nDuring 2018, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $9.7 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $7.2 million due to higher cost of funds.\nDuring 2017, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $21.3 million due to both higher volumes and higher yields, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $3.3 million due to higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nDuring 2016, our earnings on interest earning assets increased $5.3 million as the increase in earnings due to higher volumes, primarily loans, more than offset reductions in yield, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $2.2 million primarily due to both higher cost of funds, principally on short-term borrowings, and higher volumes of interest bearing deposits.\nTotal average earning assets increased 6.4% to $1.99 billion for 2018 from $1.87 billion in 2017.

Our net interest margin decreased 10 basis points during 2018 as the cost of funds increased 37 basis points while yields on interest earning assets increased 21 basis points. The 2018 increase in yields on interest earning assets was negatively impacted by lower taxable equivalent adjustments to interest earned on tax-exempt securities and loans as a result of enactment of the TCJA in late\n2017, which lowered our statutory corporate Federal income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, from 35% to 21%. Our net interest margin increased 28 basis points in 2017 primarily due to the 25 basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets. See Tables I and II for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our net interest income.\nAssuming no significant unanticipated changes in market interest rates, we expect growth in our net interest income to continue over the near term primarily due to continuing expected growth in earning assets, primarily loans. We continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact.\nSee the Market Risk Management\u201d section for discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us.
