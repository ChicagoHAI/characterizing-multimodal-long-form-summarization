In addition to historical financial information, some of the information contained in the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Our first commercial product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, is a non-invasive and non-systemic office-based treatment that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, to create a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field that induces electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The system is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to treat adult patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, that have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is safe, clinically effective, reproducible and precise and we believe is supported by the largest clinical data set of any competing TMS system. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on our U.S. installed base of 1,170 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in approximately 916 psychiatrist offices as of December 31, 2020 and the estimated 100,231 patients treated with approximately 3.6 million of our treatment sessions through such date. We generated revenues of $49.2 million and $62.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System as a non-invasive therapeutic alternative to treat patients who suffer from MDD and to address many of the key limitations of existing treatment options. We generate revenues from initial capital sales of our systems, sales of our recurring treatment sessions and from service and repair and extended warranty contracts. We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring treatment sessions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 73% and 23% of our U.S. revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 68% and 30% of our U.S. revenues, respectively.\nWe currently sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States through our sales and customer support team. Our sales force targets an estimated 50,000 psychiatrists across 26,000 practices that we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 42% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We expect to continue to expand our direct sales and customer support team to further penetrate the market by demonstrating the benefits of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to psychiatrists and their MDD patients. Some of our customers have and may purchase more than one NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. Based on our commercial data, we believe psychiatrists can recoup their initial capital investment in our system by providing a standard course of treatment to approximately 12 patients. We believe psychiatrists can generate approximately $7,500 to $10,000 of revenue per patient for a standard course of treatment, which may provide meaningful incremental income to their practices. We have a diverse customer base of psychiatrists in group psychiatric practices in the United States. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Patients are reimbursed by Medicare and the vast majority of commercial payors in the United States for treatment sessions utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.\nWe market our products in a few select markets outside the United States through independent distributors. International revenues represented 4% and 3% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In October 2017, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin, for the distribution of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions to customers who will treat patients with MDD in Japan. We received regulatory approval for our system in Japan in September 2017. We obtained reimbursement coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan, which went into effect on June 1, 2019 and covers patients who are treated in the largest inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities\nin Japan. We expect our international revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues as we grow our presence in Japan.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on the following: hardware and software product developments and enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and clinical development relating to additional indications, which may include bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We outsource the manufacture of components of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems that are produced to our specifications, and individual components are either shipped directly from our third-party contract manufacturers to our customers or consolidated into pallets at our Malvern, Pennsylvania facility prior to shipment. Final installation of these systems occurs at the customer site.\nOur total revenues decreased by $13.4 million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our U.S. revenues were $47.5 million, compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 22% period over period. We expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years as we expand our commercial organization to support our planned sales growth and while continuing to invest in our pipeline indications. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $277.5 million.\nOn July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,325,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds $96.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses paid by us. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol STIM.\u201d Our primary sources of capital to date have been from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and revenues from sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThroughout 2020, the Company experienced a material impact to revenue, particularly with regards to U.S. treatment session revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects that capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will continue to be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to pre-COVID-19 projections.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn February 2, 2021, we closed on our public offering and sale (the Offering) of our common stock in which we issued and sold 5,566,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares pursuant to an option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $80.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, marketing and evaluating new clinical indications.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTo date, we have generated revenues primarily from the capital portion of our business and related sales and rentals of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and the recurring revenues from our sale of treatment sessions in the United States.\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy System Revenues. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues consist primarily of sales or rentals of a capital component, including upgrades to the equipment attributable to the initial sale of the system. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems can be purchased outright or on a rent-to-own basis by\ncertain customers. We had an installed base of 1,170 and 1,085 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTreatment Session Revenues. Treatment session revenues primarily include sales of NeuroStar Treatment Sessions and SenStar treatment links. The NeuroStar Treatment Sessions are access codes that are delivered electronically in the United States. The SenStar treatment links are disposable units containing single-use access codes that are sold and used outside the United States. Access codes are purchased separately by our customers, primarily on an as-needed basis, and are required by the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in order to deliver treatment sessions.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues are derived primarily from service and repair extended warranty contracts with our existing customers.\nWe refer you to the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding how we account for revenues.\nSales in the United States represented 96% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and have been generated by our direct sales force. Outside the United States, our sales are made through local third-party distributors. International revenues were 4% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that both our United States and international revenues will increase in the near term as we continue to expand the installed base of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and increase the related patient utilization in the United States, as well as grow our presence in Japan. We expect our revenues to be positively impacted to the extent our direct sales force is successful in increasing the rate of adoption and utilization of treatment with TMS Therapy as an alternative to other MDD treatments.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of components and products purchased from our third-party contract manufacturers of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as well as the cost of treatment packs for individual treatment sessions. We use third-party contract manufacturing partners to produce the components for and assemble the completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. Cost of revenues also includes costs related to personnel, royalties, warranty, shipping, and our operations and field service departments. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as and to the extent our revenues grow.\nOur gross profit is calculated by subtracting our cost of revenues from our revenues. We calculate our gross margin as our gross profit divided by our revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily product sales mix, pricing and third-party contract manufacturing costs. Our gross margins on revenues from sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems are lower than our gross margins on revenues from sales of treatment sessions and, as a result, the sales mix between NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions can affect the gross margin in any reporting period.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist of market research and commercial activities related to the sale of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions and salaries and related benefits, sales commissions and share-based compensation for employees focused on these efforts. Other significant sales and marketing costs include conferences and trade shows, promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing, practice support programs, television and radio media campaigns, travel and training expenses.\nWe anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to execute on our growth initiatives and expand our business in the United States. The increase in sales and marketing expense from growth initiatives will be partially offset by a decrease in costs related to personnel expenses as a result of reduction in commercial headcount due to the company's reduction in force announced in April 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits, share-based compensation and travel expenses, for employees in executive, finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expenses also include the cost of insurance, outside legal fees, accounting and other consulting services, audit fees from our independent registered public accounting firm, board of directors' fees and other administrative costs, such as corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance not otherwise included in cost of revenues.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in fiscal year 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits and share-based compensation for employees in clinical development, product development, regulatory and quality assurance functions, as well as expenses associated with outsourced professional scientific development services and costs of investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical and clinical development programs. We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs.\nWe plan to incur research and development expenses for the near future as we expect to continue our development of TMS Therapy for the treatment of additional patient populations and new indications, which may include bipolar depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and potential other clinical indications yet to be determined, as well as for various hardware and software development projects. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to remain similar to our fiscal year 2020 expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of cash interest payable under our credit facility and non-cash interest attributable to the accrual of final payment fees and the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our money market account balances.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million from 2019 to 2020 due to lower unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year decrease in international revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in Japan.\nRevenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million, or 22%, from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue in the United States decreased by $6.9 million, or 38%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a 35% decrease in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The decrease in NeuroStar capital revenue was primarily driven by a decrease of 84 units in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold from 250 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 166 units for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in volume for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 as demand for our NeuroStar Therapy System units was significantly impacted given the economic slow-down and inability of our sales team to conduct business in-person due to extensive travel restrictions and customer office closures due to governmental measures. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 1,170 active systems in the United States, compared to 1,085 as of December 31, 2019.\nTreatment sessions revenues in the United States represented 73% and 68% of total revenues in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and decreased by 15% from $41.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019 to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in U.S. treatment session revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in 115,634 sessions sold from 555,570 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 439,936 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in overall volume of treatment session revenue between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were under prolonged quarantines, restrictions and other requirements on travel that decreased the utilization of our treatment sessions at provider practices.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues decreased by $3.8 million, or 25%, from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin was 76.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin was the result of a change in the product mix of revenue versus the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $10.4 million, or 24%, from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $4.9 million in personnel costs, $3.2 million in marketing, including trade shows and advertising, and $2.0 million in travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in severance expense offset by a reduction of $0.5 million in professional fees and $0.3 million in share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.5 million, or 33%, from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.7 million in the development of our next generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and $1.7 in other miscellaneous product development expenses. The remaining decrease primarily relates to a reduction in clinical and quality assurance expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 23%, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was due to our recognition of unamortized debt discount and deferred issuance costs as part of Oxford debt facility extinguishment in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased by $1.3 million, or 81% from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to ($0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of decreased interest income earned on the Company's money market accounts.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td>

year ended December 31, 2018 to $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million from 2018 to 2019 due to higher unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year increase in international revenue was primarily due to multi-unit orders by Teijin Pharma Limited, our Japanese partner, during the second and third quarters of 2019.\nRevenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million, or 18%, from $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues in the United States grew by $3.4 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by a 25% increase in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The increase in NeuroStar capital revenue was driven by a total of 250 NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold, which was an increase of 43% over the NeuroStar systems sold in 2018. This increase was offset by a 12% decline in average selling prices as compared to 2018 as a result of a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales.\nWe believe the growth in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was the result of the efforts of our expanded commercial organization and increased marketing efforts. As of December 31, 2019, we had an installed base of 1,085 active systems in the United States, compared to 907 as of December 31, 2018.\nTreatment session revenues in the United States represented 68% and 69% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and increased by 17% from $35.3 million for the year end December 31, 2018 to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in U.S. treatment session revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the U.S. active installed base, which was partially offset by a decline in average U.S. treatment session revenue per active system. Average U.S. treatment session revenue per active system is calculated using the prior quarter's ending active installed base, which was 1,032 as of September 30, 2019 and 858 as of September 30, 2018. For the full year 2019, the average U.S. treatment session revenue per active system was approximately $39,900, which was a decrease of 3% compared to the full year 2018.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues increased by $2.9 million, or 24%, from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System sales. Gross margin was 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 76.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher percentage of sales-type leases combined with lower average selling prices on capital sales. This decrease was partially offset by increased leverage on our service and operations costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 12%, from $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to\nincreased personnel costs as a result of our sales and marketing expansion activities, as well as higher marketing expenses and sales commission costs, consistent with our growth in revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million, or 28%, from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and legal, accounting and other professional services expenses required to support the growth of our business and the infrastructure for public company reporting.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $5.5 million, or 67%, from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to expenses relating to the launch of the next generation of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and TrakStar practice management system, as well as increased spending in clinical development.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was flat at $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther expense (income), net increased by $2.1 million from $0.6 million for year December 31, 2018 to ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of increased interest income earned on the Company's money market accounts and the final revaluation of the Company's warrants in the third quarter of 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOn July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 6.325 million shares of our common stock, which included shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $96.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses paid by us. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol STIM.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $49.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $277.5 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million and an accumulated deficit of $250.1 million as of December 31, 2019. We incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of $28.4 million and $30.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we anticipate that our operating losses will continue in the near term as we seek to expand our sales and marketing initiatives to support our growth in existing and new markets, invest funds in additional research and development activities and utilize cash for other corporate purposes. Our primary sources of capital to date have been from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and sales of our products. As of December 31, 2020, we had $35.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, which has a final maturity in February 2025. Management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, in addition to the $80.6 million in net proceeds raised from the Offering, and anticipated revenues from sales of its products are sufficient to fund the Company's operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements.\nWe cannot predict our revenues and expenses in the short term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses. We also incur additional costs as a public company. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated revenues from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through March 3, 2022. However, if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional common or preferred equity or debt securities or enter into a new credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders would experience dilution and any new equity securities could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. We cannot be assured that additional equity, equity-linked or debt financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders, or at all. It is also possible that we may allocate significant amounts of capital towards products or technologies for which market demand is lower than expected and, as a result, abandon such efforts. If we are unable to maintain our current financing or obtain adequate additional financing when we require it, or if we obtain financing on terms which are not favorable to us, or if we expend capital on products or technologies that are unsuccessful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marketing of our products.\nOur current and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of COVID-19 and related governmental responses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to achieve revenue growth and improve operating margins;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> compliance with the terms and conditions, including covenants, set forth in our credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of expanding our operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to improve or maintain coverage and reimbursement arrangements with domestic third-party and government payors, particularly in Japan;\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our rate of progress in establishing coverage and reimbursement arrangements from international commercial third-party and government payors;\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our products and maintaining or improving our sales to our current customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of research and development activities, including research and development relating to additional indications, which may include bipolar depression;\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to international expansion; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Cash Used in Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,390\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (30,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,591\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,751\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,875\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for 2020 was $28.4 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $27.5 million and an increase in net operating assets of $8.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.3 million. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to an increase in net investment in sales-type leases as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases\u201d, an increase in prepaid commission expense as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" and a decrease in accrued expenses due to timing and the 2020 payments of 2019 incentive compensation and commissions accrued as of December 31, 2019. Non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, share-based compensation, the cost of rental units purchased by customers, and the loss on debt extinguishment.\nNet cash used in operating activities for 2019 was $30.5 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $29.0 million and an increase in net operating assets of $6.9 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $5.5 million. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of higher sales volumes, as well as increases in prepaid commission expense as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". Non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, share-based compensation, and the cost of rental units purchased by customers.\nNet cash used in operating activities for 2018 was $20.6 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of $24.1 million, offset by an increase in net operating liabilities of $1.6 million and non-cash charges of $5.1 million. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of higher sales volumes. Non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, share-based compensation, the cost of rental units purchased by customers and the change in the fair value of the liability related to our then-outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and was in each case attributable to purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software costs.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was $2.4 million and consisted of additional proceeds from our loan refinance and cash proceeds related to stock option exercises.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $2.4 million, consisting primarily from proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2018 was $97.0 million, consisting primarily of $100.0 million of proceeds related to the closing of our IPO on July 2, 2018, partially offset by $3.5 million of payments of costs related to the IPO.\nIndebtedness\nSolar Credit Facility\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. ( Solar\u201d), as collateral agent, and other lenders defined in the agreement, for a credit facility (the Solar Facility\u201d) that replaced the Company's previous $35.0 million credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC ( Oxford\u201d, and such facility, the Oxford Facility\u201d).\nThe Solar Facility permits the Company to borrow up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million in two tranches of term loans, a Term A Loan\u201d and Term B Loan\u201d. On March 2, 2020, the Company borrowed an aggregate amount of $35.0 million, which was the aggregate amount available under the Term A Loan portion of the Solar Facility. The Term A Loan portion of the Solar Facility matures, and all amounts borrowed thereunder are due, on February 28, 2025. Under the Term B Loan portion of the Solar Facility, the Company is permitted to borrow, at its election, up to an aggregate amount of $15.0 million, (i) upon the Company achieving a specified amount of trailing twelve months net product revenue, and (ii) assuming there has been no event of default under the Solar Facility prior to such election. Once the net product revenue condition has been satisfied, the Company may only make an election to borrow under the Term B Loan portion of the Solar Facility until the earlier of (a) December 15, 2021, (b) 30 days following achievement of the net product revenue condition or (c) the occurrence of an event of default.\nEach of the Term A Loan and Term B Loan accrue interest from the date of borrowing through the date of repayment at a floating per annum rate of interest, which resets monthly and is equal to 7.65% plus the greater of (a) 1.66% or (b) the rate per annum rate published by the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. The Term A Loan and the Term B Loan both include an interest-only period through March 1, 2022, after which time the Company will be required to make monthly payments of principal and interest. Monthly principal payments are to be paid in equal amounts on a pro rata basis to lenders. At the Company's election, the interest only period may be extended through February 2023, if the Company satisfies a minimum net product revenue covenant through March 1, 2022 and no event of default shall have occurred.\nIn addition to the principal and interest payments due under the Solar Facility, the Company is required to pay a final payment fee to Solar due upon the earlier of prepayment, acceleration or the maturity date of the Term A Loan or Term B Loan portion of the Solar Facility equal to 5.50% of the principal amount of the term loans actually funded. The Company is accruing the final payment fees using the effective interest rate, with a charge to non-cash interest expense, over the term of borrowing. If the Company prepays either the of the Term A Loan or Term B Loan prior to their respective scheduled maturities, the Company will also be required to pay prepayment fees to Solar equal to 3% of the principal amount of such term loan then-prepaid, if prepaid on or before the first anniversary of funding, 2% of the principal amount of such term loan then-prepaid if prepaid after the first anniversary and on or before the second anniversary of funding, or 1% of the principal amount of such term loan then-prepaid, if prepaid after the second anniversary of funding of the principal amounts borrowed.\nThe Company is also required to pay Solar an exit fee upon the occurrence, prior to March 2, 2030, of (a) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, (b) transaction that results in a person obtaining control over the Company, (c) the Company achieving $100 million in trailing twelve month net product revenue or (d) the\nCompany achieving $125 million in trailing twelve month net product revenue. The exit fee for liquidation, dissolution, winding up or change of control of the Company is equal to 4.50% of the principal amount of the term loans actually funded. The exit fee for achieving either $100 million or $125 million in trailing twelve-month net product revenue is equal to 2.25% of the principal amount of the term loans actually funded or, if both net product revenue milestones are achieved, 4.50% of the principal amount of the term loans actually funded. The exit fee is capped at 4.50% of the principal amount of the term loans actually funded.\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company, Solar Capital Ltd., and our other lenders defined in the Solar Facility, executed an amendment to the Solar Facility (the Solar Amendment\u201d). The Solar Amendment divides the aggregate Term B Loan borrowing amount of $15.0 million allowable upon our achievement of specific trailing twelve-month net product revenue targets into three separate $5.0 million tranches ( Amended Term B Loan\u201d, Term C Loan\u201d and Term D Loan\u201d). The three tranches are available through June 20, 2021, December 20, 2021, and June 20, 2022, respectively, based on the achievement of agreed upon trailing twelve-month net product revenue targets for each tranche.\nThe Solar Amendment also reduces the trailing twelve-month net product revenue requirement for the Amended Term B Loan portion of the facility. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the ability to extend the interest only period on the initial Term A Loan to 36 months from 24 months upon achieving the revenue targets associated with the Amended Term B Loan. The Company was required to pay an amendment fee of $0.1 million to Solar, which has been recognized as a deferred debt issuance cost as of December 31, 2020 that will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nThe Company's obligations under the Solar Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of its assets, including its intellectual property. The loan and security agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nThe Solar Facility contains events of default, including, without limitation, events of default upon: (i) failure to make payment pursuant to the terms of the agreement; (ii) violation of covenants; (iii) material adverse changes to the Company's business; (iv) attachment or levy on the Company's assets or judicial restraint on its business; (v) insolvency; (vi) material cross-defaults; (vii) significant judgments, orders or decrees for payments by the Company not covered by insurance; (viii) incorrectness of representations and warranties; (ix) incurrence of subordinated debt; (x) a termination or breach of a guaranty; (xi) revocation of governmental approvals necessary for the Company to conduct its business; and (xii) failure by the Company to maintain a valid and perfected lien on the collateral securing the borrowing. The Solar Facility includes subjective acceleration clauses which permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, material adverse effects on a Company's financial status or otherwise.\nThe Solar Facility includes a financial covenant requiring the attainment of a minimum trailing net revenue amount beginning on December 31, 2020. The Company and lenders executed the Solar Amendment in December 2020 that reduces the minimum trailing net revenue covenant requirement amounts beginning on December 31, 2020 to allow the Company to maintain compliance with the covenant as of December 31, 2020. The Company is projected to be in compliance with the reduced minimum revenue covenant amounts going forward.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company is in compliance with all covenants in the Solar Facility.\nBased on a 36-month amortization of the outstanding principal amounts of the Term A Loan beginning on April 1, 2022 as discussed above, the following table sets forth by year our required future principal payments under the Term A Loan (in thousands):\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> Year:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal\nPayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total principal payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOxford Credit Facility\nPrior to March 2020, the Company had a $35.0 million credit facility in place with Oxford, which it entered into in March 2017 and that allowed it to borrow up to $35.0 million in three tranches of term loans: a Term A Loan in the amount of $25 million, which was drawn immediately upon closing in March 2017, a Term B Loan in the amount of $5.0 million, which was drawn down in December 2017, and a Term C Loan in the amount of $5.0 million which was never drawn down. Each term loan accrued interest from the date of borrowing through the date of repayment at a floating per annum rate of interest, which reset monthly and was equal to the greater of (a) 8.15% or (b) the 30 day U.S. LIBOR on the last business day of the month plus 7.38%. This facility featured an interest-only period on all tranches through March 2019.\nIn addition to principal and interest payments due under the $35.0 million Oxford credit facility, the Company was required to make final payment fees to Oxford upon the earlier of prepayment or maturity and equal to 8.5% and 7.5% of the principal amounts of the Term A and Term B Loans, respectively. The Company accrued final payment fees using the effective interest rate, with a charge to non-cash interest expense, over the term of borrowing and until its entry into the Solar credit facility in March 2020, at which time the Company paid Oxford $2.5 million in satisfaction of all final payment fee liabilities due under the Oxford credit facility.\nThe Company evaluated whether the Solar credit facility entered into in March 2020 represented a debt modification or extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments and determined that the existing debt was extinguished as a result of the full repayment of the existing facility and concurrent issuance of a new credit facility with a new lender. The unamortized balance of the Company's combined debt discount and deferred issuance costs of $0.6 million related to the Oxford facility were accounted for as a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nCash and Non-Cash Interest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized interest expense of $4.5 million, of which $3.9 million was cash and $0.6 million was non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs and accrual of final payment fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized interest expense of $3.7 million, of which $2.9 million was cash and $0.8 million was non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs and accrual of final payment fees.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn February 2, 2021, we closed on the Offering of our common stock in which we issued and sold 5,566,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares pursuant to an option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $80.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, marketing and evaluating new clinical indications.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, partnerships or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and lender fees on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest payable reflects the rate in effect as of December 31, 2020.

We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable when made, they are based upon information available to us at the time they are made. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and, if necessary, make adjustments. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in our business and evolving market conditions and given the subjective element of the estimates and assumptions made, actual results may differ from estimated results.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our audited financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those good or services. Accordingly, we determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> determination of the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe primarily earn revenues from the sale of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, consumable use treatment sessions, and accessory products. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied, which generally is the point in time when the product is shipped or control is transferred. We sell to end users in the United States and to third-party distributors outside the United States and do not provide return rights. Sales to distributors outside the United States are made in U.S. dollars.\nRevenue attributable to the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems purchased on a rent-to-own basis are accounted for either (1) as operating leases and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease; or (2) as a sales-type lease and revenue is recognized upon installation.\nOur NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System sales in the United States typically have a post-sale training obligation. This obligation is fulfilled after product shipment, and we defer recognizing revenue until training occurs. We defer the fair value attributable to the post shipment training and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled. We base the fair value of the training using stand-alone service rates. Our sales to our third-party distributors outside the United States do not have these post-sale obligations.\nIn addition, we provide a one to two-year warranty for systems sold in the United States. Terms of product warranty differ amongst our third-party distributors outside the United States, but are generally two years. We provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products under any warranty at the time of sale. We also offer our customers in the United States annual service contracts. Revenue from the sale of annual service contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the applicable contract. We also earn revenue from customers from services outside of their warranty term or annual service contracts. Such service revenue is recognized as the services are provided.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which election is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nSubject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we may rely on certain other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, including without limitation (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more; (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous six years; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe refer you to Note 4. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides a detailed analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a medical technology company.

Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, some of the information contained in the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Our first commercial product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, is a non-invasive and non-systemic office-based treatment that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, to create a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field that induces electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The system is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to treat adult patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, that have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is safe, clinically effective, reproducible and precise and we believe is supported by the largest clinical data set of any competing TMS system. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on our U.S. installed base of 1,170 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in approximately 916 psychiatrist offices as of December 31, 2020 and the estimated 100,231 patients treated with approximately 3.6 million of our treatment sessions through such date. We generated revenues of $49.2 million and $62.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System as a non-invasive therapeutic alternative to treat patients who suffer from MDD and to address many of the key limitations of existing treatment options. We generate revenues from initial capital sales of our systems, sales of our recurring treatment sessions and from service and repair and extended warranty contracts. We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring treatment sessions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 73% and 23% of our U.S. revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 68% and 30% of our U.S. revenues, respectively.\nWe currently sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States through our sales and customer support team. Our sales force targets an estimated 50,000 psychiatrists across 26,000 practices that we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 42% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We expect to continue to expand our direct sales and customer support team to further penetrate the market by demonstrating the benefits of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to psychiatrists and their MDD patients. Some of our customers have and may purchase more than one NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. Based on our commercial data, we believe psychiatrists can recoup their initial capital investment in our system by providing a standard course of treatment to approximately 12 patients. We believe psychiatrists can generate approximately $7,500 to $10,000 of revenue per patient for a standard course of treatment, which may provide meaningful incremental income to their practices. We have a diverse customer base of psychiatrists in group psychiatric practices in the United States. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Patients are reimbursed by Medicare and the vast majority of commercial payors in the United States for treatment sessions utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.\nWe market our products in a few select markets outside the United States through independent distributors. International revenues represented 4% and 3% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In October 2017, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin, for the distribution of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions to customers who will treat patients with MDD in Japan. We received regulatory approval for our system in Japan in September 2017. We obtained reimbursement coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan, which went into effect on June 1, 2019 and covers patients who are treated in the largest inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities\nin Japan. We expect our international revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues as we grow our presence in Japan.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on the following: hardware and software product developments and enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and clinical development relating to additional indications, which may include bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We outsource the manufacture of components of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems that are produced to our specifications, and individual components are either shipped directly from our third-party contract manufacturers to our customers or consolidated into pallets at our Malvern, Pennsylvania facility prior to shipment. Final installation of these systems occurs at the customer site.\nOur total revenues decreased by $13.4 million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our U.S. revenues were $47.5 million, compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 22% period over period. We expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years as we expand our commercial organization to support our planned sales growth and while continuing to invest in our pipeline indications. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $277.5 million.\nOn July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,325,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds $96.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses paid by us. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol STIM.\u201d Our primary sources of capital to date have been from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and revenues from sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThroughout 2020, the Company experienced a material impact to revenue, particularly with regards to U.S. treatment session revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects that capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will continue to be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to pre-COVID-19 projections.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn February 2, 2021, we closed on our public offering and sale (the Offering) of our common stock in which we issued and sold 5,566,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares pursuant to an option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $80.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, marketing and evaluating new clinical indications.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTo date, we have generated revenues primarily from the capital portion of our business and related sales and rentals of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and the recurring revenues from our sale of treatment sessions in the United States.\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy System Revenues. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues consist primarily of sales or rentals of a capital component, including upgrades to the equipment attributable to the initial sale of the system. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems can be purchased outright or on a rent-to-own basis by\ncertain customers. We had an installed base of 1,170 and 1,085 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTreatment Session Revenues. Treatment session revenues primarily include sales of NeuroStar Treatment Sessions and SenStar treatment links. The NeuroStar Treatment Sessions are access codes that are delivered electronically in the United States. The SenStar treatment links are disposable units containing single-use access codes that are sold and used outside the United States. Access codes are purchased separately by our customers, primarily on an as-needed basis, and are required by the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in order to deliver treatment sessions.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues are derived primarily from service and repair extended warranty contracts with our existing customers.\nWe refer you to the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding how we account for revenues.\nSales in the United States represented 96% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and have been generated by our direct sales force. Outside the United States, our sales are made through local third-party distributors. International revenues were 4% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that both our United States and international revenues will increase in the near term as we continue to expand the installed base of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and increase the related patient utilization in the United States, as well as grow our presence in Japan. We expect our revenues to be positively impacted to the extent our direct sales force is successful in increasing the rate of adoption and utilization of treatment with TMS Therapy as an alternative to other MDD treatments.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of components and products purchased from our third-party contract manufacturers of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as well as the cost of treatment packs for individual treatment sessions. We use third-party contract manufacturing partners to produce the components for and assemble the completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. Cost of revenues also includes costs related to personnel, royalties, warranty, shipping, and our operations and field service departments. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as and to the extent our revenues grow.\nOur gross profit is calculated by subtracting our cost of revenues from our revenues. We calculate our gross margin as our gross profit divided by our revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily product sales mix, pricing and third-party contract manufacturing costs. Our gross margins on revenues from sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems are lower than our gross margins on revenues from sales of treatment sessions and, as a result, the sales mix between NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions can affect the gross margin in any reporting period.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist of market research and commercial activities related to the sale of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions and salaries and related benefits, sales commissions and share-based compensation for employees focused on these efforts. Other significant sales and marketing costs include conferences and trade shows, promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing, practice support programs, television and radio media campaigns, travel and training expenses.\nWe anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to execute on our growth initiatives and expand our business in the United States. The increase in sales and marketing expense from growth initiatives will be partially offset by a decrease in costs related to personnel expenses as a result of reduction in commercial headcount due to the company's reduction in force announced in April 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits, share-based compensation and travel expenses, for employees in executive, finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expenses also include the cost of insurance, outside legal fees, accounting and other consulting services, audit fees from our independent registered public accounting firm, board of directors' fees and other administrative costs, such as corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance not otherwise included in cost of revenues.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in fiscal year 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits and share-based compensation for employees in clinical development, product development, regulatory and quality assurance functions, as well as expenses associated with outsourced professional scientific development services and costs of investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical and clinical development programs. We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs.\nWe plan to incur research and development expenses for the near future as we expect to continue our development of TMS Therapy for the treatment of additional patient populations and new indications, which may include bipolar depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and potential other clinical indications yet to be determined, as well as for various hardware and software development projects. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to remain similar to our fiscal year 2020 expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of cash interest payable under our credit facility and non-cash interest attributable to the accrual of final payment fees and the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our money market account balances.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased by $13.4 million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million from 2019 to 2020 due to lower unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year decrease in international revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in Japan.\nRevenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million, or 22%, from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue in the United States decreased by $6.9 million, or 38%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a 35% decrease in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The decrease in NeuroStar capital revenue was primarily driven by a decrease of 84 units in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold from 250 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 166 units for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in volume for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 as demand for our NeuroStar Therapy System units was significantly impacted given the economic slow-down and inability of our sales team to conduct business in-person due to extensive travel restrictions and customer office closures due to governmental measures. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 1,170 active systems in the United States, compared to 1,085 as of December 31, 2019.\nTreatment sessions revenues in the United States represented 73% and 68% of total revenues in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and decreased by 15% from $41.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019 to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in U.S. treatment session revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in 115,634 sessions sold from 555,570 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 439,936 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in overall volume of treatment session revenue between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were under prolonged quarantines, restrictions and other requirements on travel that decreased the utilization of our treatment sessions at provider practices.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues decreased by $3.8 million, or 25%, from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin was 76.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin was the result of a change in the product mix of revenue versus the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $10.4 million, or 24%, from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $4.9 million in personnel costs, $3.2 million in marketing, including trade shows and advertising, and $2.0 million in travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in severance expense offset by a reduction of $0.5 million in professional fees and $0.3 million in share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.5 million, or 33%, from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.7 million in the development of our next generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and $1.7 in other miscellaneous product development expenses. The remaining decrease primarily relates to a reduction in clinical and quality assurance expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 23%, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was due to our recognition of unamortized debt discount and deferred issuance costs as part of Oxford debt facility extinguishment in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased by $1.3 million, or 81% from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to ($0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of decreased interest income earned on the Company's money market accounts.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n\n\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased by $9.9 million, or 19%, from $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million from 2018 to 2019 due to higher unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year increase in international revenue was primarily due to multi-unit orders by Teijin Pharma Limited, our Japanese partner, during the second and third quarters of 2019.\nRevenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million, or 18%, from $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues in the United States grew by $3.4 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by a 25% increase in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The increase in NeuroStar capital revenue was driven by a total of 250 NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold, which was an increase of 43% over the NeuroStar systems sold in 2018. This increase was offset by a 12% decline in average selling prices as compared to 2018 as a result of a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales.\nWe believe the growth in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was the result of the efforts of our expanded commercial organization and increased marketing efforts. As of December 31, 2019, we had an installed base of 1,085 active systems in the United States, compared to 907 as of December 31,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, some of the information contained in the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Our first commercial product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, is a non-invasive and non-systemic office-based treatment that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, to create a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field that induces electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The system is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to treat adult patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, that have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is safe, clinically effective, reproducible and precise and we believe is supported by the largest clinical data set of any competing TMS system. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on our U.S. installed base of 1,170 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in approximately 916 psychiatrist offices as of December 31, 2020 and the estimated 100,231 patients treated with approximately 3.6 million of our treatment sessions through such date. We generated revenues of $49.2 million and $62.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System as a non-invasive therapeutic alternative to treat patients who suffer from MDD and to address many of the key limitations of existing treatment options. We generate revenues from initial capital sales of our systems, sales of our recurring treatment sessions and from service and repair and extended warranty contracts. We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring treatment sessions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 73% and 23% of our U.S. revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from sales of our treatment sessions and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems represented 68% and 30% of our U.S. revenues, respectively.\nWe currently sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States through our sales and customer support team. Our sales force targets an estimated 50,000 psychiatrists across 26,000 practices that we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 42% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We expect to continue to expand our direct sales and customer support team to further penetrate the market by demonstrating the benefits of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to psychiatrists and their MDD patients. Some of our customers have and may purchase more than one NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. Based on our commercial data, we believe psychiatrists can recoup their initial capital investment in our system by providing a standard course of treatment to approximately 12 patients. We believe psychiatrists can generate approximately $7,500 to $10,000 of revenue per patient for a standard course of treatment, which may provide meaningful incremental income to their practices. We have a diverse customer base of psychiatrists in group psychiatric practices in the United States. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Patients are reimbursed by Medicare and the vast majority of commercial payors in the United States for treatment sessions utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.\nWe market our products in a few select markets outside the United States through independent distributors. International revenues represented 4% and 3% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In October 2017, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin, for the distribution of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions to customers who will treat patients with MDD in Japan. We received regulatory approval for our system in Japan in September 2017. We obtained reimbursement coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan, which went into effect on June 1, 2019 and covers patients who are treated in the largest inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities\nin Japan. We expect our international revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues as we grow our presence in Japan.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on the following: hardware and software product developments and enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and clinical development relating to additional indications, which may include bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We outsource the manufacture of components of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems that are produced to our specifications, and individual components are either shipped directly from our third-party contract manufacturers to our customers or consolidated into pallets at our Malvern, Pennsylvania facility prior to shipment. Final installation of these systems occurs at the customer site.\nOur total revenues decreased by $13.4 million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our U.S. revenues were $47.5 million, compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented a decrease of 22% period over period. We expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years as we expand our commercial organization to support our planned sales growth and while continuing to invest in our pipeline indications. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $277.5 million.\nOn July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6,325,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds $96.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses paid by us. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol STIM.\u201d Our primary sources of capital to date have been from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and revenues from sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThroughout 2020, the Company experienced a material impact to revenue, particularly with regards to U.S. treatment session revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects that capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will continue to be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to pre-COVID-19 projections.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn February 2, 2021, we closed on our public offering and sale (the Offering) of our common stock in which we issued and sold 5,566,000 shares of our common stock, which included shares pursuant to an option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $80.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, marketing and evaluating new clinical indications.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTo date, we have generated revenues primarily from the capital portion of our business and related sales and rentals of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and the recurring revenues from our sale of treatment sessions in the United States.\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy System Revenues. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues consist primarily of sales or rentals of a capital component, including upgrades to the equipment attributable to the initial sale of the system. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems can be purchased outright or on a rent-to-own basis by\ncertain customers. We had an installed base of 1,170 and 1,085 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTreatment Session Revenues. Treatment session revenues primarily include sales of NeuroStar Treatment Sessions and SenStar treatment links. The NeuroStar Treatment Sessions are access codes that are delivered electronically in the United States. The SenStar treatment links are disposable units containing single-use access codes that are sold and used outside the United States. Access codes are purchased separately by our customers, primarily on an as-needed basis, and are required by the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in order to deliver treatment sessions.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues are derived primarily from service and repair extended warranty contracts with our existing customers.\nWe refer you to the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding how we account for revenues.\nSales in the United States represented 96% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and have been generated by our direct sales force. Outside the United States, our sales are made through local third-party distributors. International revenues were 4% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that both our United States and international revenues will increase in the near term as we continue to expand the installed base of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and increase the related patient utilization in the United States, as well as grow our presence in Japan. We expect our revenues to be positively impacted to the extent our direct sales force is successful in increasing the rate of adoption and utilization of treatment with TMS Therapy as an alternative to other MDD treatments.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of components and products purchased from our third-party contract manufacturers of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems as well as the cost of treatment packs for individual treatment sessions. We use third-party contract manufacturing partners to produce the components for and assemble the completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. Cost of revenues also includes costs related to personnel, royalties, warranty, shipping, and our operations and field service departments. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars as and to the extent our revenues grow.\nOur gross profit is calculated by subtracting our cost of revenues from our revenues. We calculate our gross margin as our gross profit divided by our revenues. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily product sales mix, pricing and third-party contract manufacturing costs. Our gross margins on revenues from sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems are lower than our gross margins on revenues from sales of treatment sessions and, as a result, the sales mix between NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions can affect the gross margin in any reporting period.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist of market research and commercial activities related to the sale of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions and salaries and related benefits, sales commissions and share-based compensation for employees focused on these efforts. Other significant sales and marketing costs include conferences and trade shows, promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing, practice support programs, television and radio media campaigns, travel and training expenses.\nWe anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to execute on our growth initiatives and expand our business in the United States. The increase in sales and marketing expense from growth initiatives will be partially offset by a decrease in costs related to personnel expenses as a result of reduction in commercial headcount due to the company's reduction in force announced in April 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits, share-based compensation and travel expenses, for employees in executive, finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expenses also include the cost of insurance, outside legal fees, accounting and other consulting services, audit fees from our independent registered public accounting firm, board of directors' fees and other administrative costs, such as corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance not otherwise included in cost of revenues.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in fiscal year 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries and related benefits and share-based compensation for employees in clinical development, product development, regulatory and quality assurance functions, as well as expenses associated with outsourced professional scientific development services and costs of investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical and clinical development programs. We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs.\nWe plan to incur research and development expenses for the near future as we expect to continue our development of TMS Therapy for the treatment of additional patient populations and new indications, which may include bipolar depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and potential other clinical indications yet to be determined, as well as for various hardware and software development projects. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to remain similar to our fiscal year 2020 expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of cash interest payable under our credit facility and non-cash interest attributable to the accrual of final payment fees and the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our money market account balances.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

million, or 21%, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million from 2019 to 2020 due to lower unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year decrease in international revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in Japan.\nRevenues in the United States decreased by $13.2 million, or 22%, from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue in the United States decreased by $6.9 million, or 38%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a 35% decrease in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The decrease in NeuroStar capital revenue was primarily driven by a decrease of 84 units in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold from 250 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 166 units for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in volume for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 as demand for our NeuroStar Therapy System units was significantly impacted given the economic slow-down and inability of our sales team to conduct business in-person due to extensive travel restrictions and customer office closures due to governmental measures. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 1,170 active systems in the United States, compared to 1,085 as of December 31, 2019.\nTreatment sessions revenues in the United States represented 73% and 68% of total revenues in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and decreased by 15% from $41.1 million for the year end December 31, 2019 to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in U.S. treatment session revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in 115,634 sessions sold from 555,570 units for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 439,936 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the decline in overall volume of treatment session revenue between these two periods was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were under prolonged quarantines, restrictions and other requirements on travel that decreased the utilization of our treatment sessions at provider practices.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nCost of revenues decreased by $3.8 million, or 25%, from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin was 76.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin was the result of a change in the product mix of revenue versus the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $10.4 million, or 24%, from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $4.9 million in personnel costs, $3.2 million in marketing, including trade shows and advertising, and $2.0 million in travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 4%, from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in severance expense offset by a reduction of $0.5 million in professional fees and $0.3 million in share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.5 million, or 33%, from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.7 million in the development of our next generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and $1.7 in other miscellaneous product development expenses. The remaining decrease primarily relates to a reduction in clinical and quality assurance expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 23%, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was due to our recognition of unamortized debt discount and deferred issuance costs as part of Oxford debt facility extinguishment in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased by $1.3 million, or 81% from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to ($0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of decreased interest income earned on the Company's money market accounts.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td>

year ended December 31, 2018 to $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million from 2018 to 2019 due to higher unit sales of both NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions. The year over year increase in international revenue was primarily due to multi-unit orders by Teijin Pharma Limited, our Japanese partner, during the second and third quarters of 2019.\nRevenues in the United States increased by $9.3 million, or 18%, from $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues in the United States grew by $3.4 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by a 25% increase in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System capital revenue, which includes capital sales and sales-type leases. The increase in NeuroStar capital revenue was driven by a total of 250 NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems sold, which was an increase of 43% over the NeuroStar systems sold in 2018. This increase was offset by a 12% decline in average selling prices as compared to 2018 as a result of a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales.\nWe believe the growth in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenues between these two periods was the result of the efforts of our expanded commercial organization and increased marketing efforts. As of December 31, 2019, we had an installed base of 1,085 active systems in the United States, compared to 907 as of December 31,"}
