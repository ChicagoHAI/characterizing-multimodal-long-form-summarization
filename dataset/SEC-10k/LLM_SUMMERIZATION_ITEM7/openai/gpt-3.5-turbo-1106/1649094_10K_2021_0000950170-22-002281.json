Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. We are developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, our system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate our ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Our pipeline includes pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, candidates that we believe are among the most broad-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the approximately $7 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, or IPD, and pneumonia. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared our investigational new drug, or IND, application for VAX-24. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study in adults aged 18 to 64. We expect to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study by the end of 2022. Pending the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of this study, we expect to begin enrollment in a separate Phase 2 study in healthy adults aged 65 and older and to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2023. We also anticipate submitting our first VAX-24 pediatric IND application to the FDA in the first half of 2023, subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and successful topline results from the VAX-24 Phase 1/2 study in adults aged 18 to 64. Our second PCV candidate, VAX-XP, leverages our scalable and modular platform and builds on the technical proof of concept established by VAX-24 and is designed to expand the breadth of coverage to greater than 30 strains without compromising immunogenicity due to carrier suppression. In addition to our PCV franchise, we are developing a novel conjugate vaccine candidate for Group A Strep and a novel protein vaccine candidate targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis.\nSince January 1, 2021, key developments affecting our business include the following:\n\u2022Completed the Manufacture of VAX-24 Drug Product: In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed all steps in the manufacturing process, including formulation, fill and finish, along with the testing and release, for the VAX-24 drug product. This achievement led to the submission of the VAX-24 IND application to the FDA before the end of 2021.\n\u2022Dosed First Participants in VAX-24 Phase 1/2 Clinical Study: Following the early January 2022 clearance of the VAX-24 IND application, we initiated the Phase 1/2 clinical study of VAX-24, a 24-valent PCV candidate designed to prevent IPD and pneumonia in adults. The VAX-24 clinical proof-of-concept study is a randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding, controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy adults. The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 64 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a\nsingle injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 800 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age. The prespecified immunogenicity endpoints of the Phase 2 portion of the study include an assessment of the induction of antibody responses, using immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA), at each of the VAX-24 doses and compared to Prevnar 20 and, for the additional four serotypes contained in VAX-24 and Pneumovax 23 but not in Prevnar 20, the four-fold rise in antibody titers.\n\u2022Completed Successful $115 Million Follow-On Financing: In the first quarter of 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,250,000 shares of our common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $20.00 per share, and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of $19.999 per underlying share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the offering were $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, and excluding the exercise of any pre-funded warrants.\n\u2022Advanced and Presented Preclinical Data for VAX-XP Program: We have continued to advance VAX-XP, our PCV candidate with an expanded breadth of coverage of greater than 30 strains. During IDWeek 2021, we presented findings from a preclinical study that evaluated the immunogenicity of VAX-XP, which showed VAX-XP exhibited conjugate-like immune responses for all 31 serotypes, as demonstrated by IgG immune responses 14 days after both an initial and booster dose that were superior to polysaccharide-based vaccines and comparable to Prevnar 13. Additionally, all serotypes in VAX-XP elicited a T-cell dependent immune response as demonstrated by the increase in IgG titers post-boost.\n\u2022Initiated VAX-A1 IND-Enabling Activities. We continue to advance development of VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine designed to prevent infections caused by Group A Streptococcus, or Strep, bacteria. Following the nomination of our final VAX-A1 vaccine candidate in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2021.\n\u2022Strengthened Leadership Team and Board of Directors with Key Appointments: During 2021, we added several key leaders to our executive team and Board of Directors. In October, Harp Dhaliwal joined as Senior Vice President of Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and we appointed Dr. Carlos Paya, who serves as the Board Chair, and Dr. Michael Kamarck to our board of directors. This followed the September 2021 board appointments of Annie Drapeau and Teri Loxam. These accomplished industry leaders have deep experience across the biopharmaceutical and vaccine industries and will provide additional skills and expertise as we advance and scale our business.\nSince our inception in November 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our vaccine candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending in\nlarge part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. Our net losses were $100.1 million and $89.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $298.6 million and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $273.1. million, We believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our vaccine candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022advance our vaccine candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022require the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022require the manufacture of supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, in particular our PCV candidates, VAX-24 and VAX-XP;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022hire additional personnel;\n\u2022operate as a public company;\n\u2022acquire, discover, validate and develop additional vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our vaccine candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates, we also would expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with vaccine development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our vaccines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nCertain Significant Relationships\nSutro Biopharma\nVaxcyte was formed through its relationship with Sutro Biopharma, in 2013 by our co-founders with the goal of utilizing Sutro Biopharma's proprietary XpressCF platform for protein synthesis in the field of vaccines addressing infectious diseases.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we entered into a license agreement with Sutro Biopharma, or the Sutro License, on August 1, 2014. The Sutro License was amended on October 12, 2015 and again on May 9, 2018 and May 29, 2018. Under this license, we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Sutro Biopharma's patents and know-how relating to cell-free expression of proteins to (i) research, develop, use,\nsell, offer for sale, export, import and otherwise exploit specified vaccine compositions, such rights being sublicensable, for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases, excluding cancer vaccines, and (ii) manufacture, or have manufactured by an approved contract manufacturing organization, such vaccine compositions from extracts supplied by Sutro Biopharma pursuant to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement (as described below). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize the vaccine compositions. In consideration of the rights granted under the Sutro License, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a 4% royalty on worldwide aggregate net sales of vaccine products for human health and a 2% royalty on such net sales of vaccine products for animal health. Such royalty rates are subject to specified reductions, including standard reductions for third-party payments and for expiration of relevant patent claims. Royalties are payable on a vaccine composition-by-vaccine composition and country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering such vaccine composition in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such vaccine composition. In addition, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a percentage in the low-double digits of any net sublicensing revenue received for sublicense agreements executed before July 2020. Our obligation to pay sublicense fees to Sutro Biopharma expired in July 2020.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a supply agreement, which we refer to as the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement, with Sutro Biopharma pursuant to which we purchase from Sutro Biopharma extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing non-clinical and certain clinical supply of vaccine compositions utilizing the technology licensed under the Sutro License at prices not to exceed a specified percentage above Sutro Biopharma's fully burdened manufacturing cost. If any extracts or custom reagents do not meet the specifications and warranties provided, then we will not have an obligation to pay for the non-conforming product, and Sutro Biopharma will be obligated to replace the non-conforming product within the shortest possible time with conforming product at our cost. The term of the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement is from execution until the later of July 31, 2021 and the date the parties enter into and commence activities under the supply agreement unless extended through a subsequent supply agreement for the supply of extract and custom reagents for vaccine compositions for Phase 3 and commercial uses as contemplated in the Supply Agreement. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement and extended the term to July 31, 2022.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Sutro Biopharma, see Note 14, Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLonza\nIn October 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement, as amended, with Lonza Ltd., or the Lonza DMSA, pursuant to which Lonza Ltd., or Lonza, is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture of components for VAX-24, including the polysaccharide antigens, our proprietary eCRM protein carrier and conjugated drug substances.\nIn September 2017, we and Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments for any stage that commenced after December 31, 2019 or had not been completed by December 31, 2019 until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2020. In March 2020, Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or April 30, 2021. In April 2021, Lonza further agreed to defer 50% of the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2018, we entered into a letter agreement with Lonza, pursuant to which we agreed to certain terms for potential future payments in shares of our common stock as partial satisfaction of future obligations to Lonza. Specifically, we and Lonza agreed that the initial pre-IND cash payments made by us to Lonza would be subject to a specified dollar cap, which we refer to as the Initial Cash Cap. After the Initial Cash Cap has been reached, then at our election, we would have the option to make any further pre-IND payments owed to Lonza in cash, in shares of our common stock at then market prevailing prices, or a combination of both, provided that (i) Lonza had the right to elect to receive up to 25% of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock, up to a maximum of $2.5 million, and (ii) we had the right to issue no more than $10.0 million of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock. In April 2021, we reached the Initial Cash Cap and notified Lonza that we would be exercising our option to issue approximately $10.0 million in shares of our common stock as payment for a portion\nof pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021. In June 2021, we issued 399,680 shares of our common stock to Lonza at a price of $25.02 per share to pay for $10.0 million of the pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a second development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, or the Lonza 2018 DMSA, and together with the Lonza DMSA, or the Lonza Agreements, pursuant to which Lonza is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture and supply of VAX-24 finished drug product.\nUnder the Lonza Agreements, we will pay Lonza agreed upon fees for Lonza's performance of manufacturing services, and we will reimburse Lonza for its out-of-pocket costs associated with purchasing raw materials, plus a customary handling fee. Each Lonza Agreement is managed by a steering committee and any dispute at the steering committee will be resolved by senior executives of the parties.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Lonza, see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and to maintain business continuity. We believe that the measures we have implemented and continue to implement are appropriate, and we will continue to monitor and seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for our non-lab based employees in March 2020, while maintaining essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite safety procedures, including routine testing of employees. In 2021, we began to allow non-lab employees who have been fully vaccinated to return to the office on a voluntary and limited basis. In addition, we have recently implemented requirements for employees to obtain COVID-19 booster shots.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed raw material supply chains and travel restrictions delayed the qualification of key analytical equipment used in manufacturing and curtailed in-person CMO oversight of manufacturing, affecting our manufacturing processes. As the pandemic continues, we could see an additional impact on our ability to advance our programs, obtain supplies from our contract manufacturers or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, employee resources or otherwise. In any event, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the continued spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the potential value of our common stock.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development and regulatory efforts, our ability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and the value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and include personnel-related costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) for our personnel in research and development functions; costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing supplies for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other studies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations; costs and expenses related to agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants to conduct non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials; professional and consulting services costs; research and development consumables costs; laboratory supplies and equipment costs; and facility and other allocated costs.\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed. We do not allocate our costs by vaccine candidates, as our vaccine candidates are at an early stage of development and our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, which are not tracked by vaccine candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple vaccine candidate research and development programs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our vaccine candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, scale up our manufacturing operations, pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates and expand our pipeline of vaccine candidates. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research and developing the necessary manufacturing capabilities to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our vaccine candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our vaccine candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or if, when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our vaccine candidates.\nWe accrue for costs related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors, including contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. Advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining accrued research and development liabilities as of each reporting period based on the estimated time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nOur research and development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\n\u2022the costs and timing of our chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, activities, including fulfilling GMP-related standards and compliance, and identifying and qualifying a second supplier;\n\u2022the costs related to raw materials estimates from our third-party manufacturing and supply partners;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our vaccine candidates being greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u2022the number of sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n\u2022delays in adding a sufficient number of trial sites and recruiting suitable volunteers to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the number of subjects that participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses that subjects receive;\n\u2022subjects dropping out of a study or lost in follow-up;\n\u2022potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;\n\u2022the cost and timing of manufacturing our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022the phase of development of our vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses related to personnel (including salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) in our executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions; legal services, including relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; accounting, auditing, consulting and tax services; insurance; and facility and other allocated costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities and grow our business. We also anticipate that we will incur increased expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with SEC rules and regulations and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest expense incurred on our capital leases for lab equipment, interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, grant income, foreign currency transaction gains (losses) related to our Swiss Franc cash and liability balances and changes in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability (see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 3, Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 7, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail).\nGrant Income\nIn July 2019, we received a cost-reimbursement research award from Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, a public-private partnership funded under a Cooperative Agreement from Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response/Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and by awards from Wellcome Trust, Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the United Kingdom Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program, or the CARB-X agreement. CARB-X awarded us up to $1.6 million in initial funding to advance the development of a universal vaccine to prevent infections caused by Group A Strep Bacteria. In July 2020, the CARB-X agreement was amended with the initial funding amount increased from $1.6 million to $2.7 million. In December 2020, we reached the maximum CARB-X funding limit for this initial funding period, and subsequently submitted our funding proposal to CARB-X for the next period under our agreement. In April 2021, we received approval for the next phase of CARB-X development and executed the cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University in August 2021. Pursuant to the CARB-X agreement, the award committed additional funding of $3.2 million for IND-enabling activities and total potential funding of up to $29.7 million (including the current $3.2 million award and the prior $2.7 million award) upon the achievement of future VAX-A1 development milestones. In January 2022, CARB-X revised the parameters for the contribution of CARB-X funding and implemented maximum funding levels for all grant recipients. As a result, our total funding available upon achievement of development milestones through Phase 1 human clinical trials was revised from $29.7 million to $13.9 million (inclusive of the $5.9 million awarded to date). Separately, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, awarded us up to $0.5 million in April 2021 to advance the development of a vaccine against Shigella infection. Grant income pursuant to our award agreements is recognized as we incur and pay qualifying expenses over the periods of the awards. We recognized $1.6 million, $2.5 million and $0.2 million in grant income for funding research and development under these awards during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Grant income is included as a component of Other income (expense), net in the statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following

travel-related expenses, other miscellaneous office expenses and warrant expense.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $4.8 million, or 6.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in (i) personnel-related expenses of $7.5 million related to the increase in the number of employees to support our research and development activities and higher stock-based compensation expense, (ii) facility related and other allocated expenses of $5.1 million resulting from increases in rent and lease expense as well as expenses allocated to research and development, (iii) research and development consumables of $4.6 million related to higher critical raw materials expenses and (iv) laboratory supplies and equipment expenses of $1.4 million mainly related to our VAX-24 and VAX-A1 programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $13.9 million in product and clinical development expenses, which represented the net impact of a decrease in outsourced manufacturing expenses related to our VAX-24 program and an increase in such expenses related to our VAX-XP program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $9.2 million, or 57.7%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to increases of $7.0 million in personnel-related costs related to higher stock-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the number of options granted during the year and growth in the number of employees in our general and administrative functions, $1.3 million in professional and consulting services related primarily to compliance activities under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and technology infrastructure enhancements and $1.1 million in directors and officers insurance expense as a result of operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net increased by $3.2 million, or 887.1%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $4.0 million in foreign currency gains resulting from the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Swiss Franc in 2021 compared to 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in grant income for the CARB-X program.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the

assays.\n(2)Includes travel-related expenses, other miscellaneous office expenses and warrant expense.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $28.0 million, or, 61.3% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $23.1 million in product and clinical development expenses mainly related to our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, driven by increases of $18.6 million in outsourced manufacturing activities and $4.5 million in outsourced research services due to the ramp-up of the eCRM and polysaccharide GMP campaigns and conjugation and drug product activities in preparation for our anticipated IND application submission in the first quarter of 2022 and Phase 1/2 clinical study initiation thereafter. The increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.0 million was primarily related to the increase in the number of employees to support our expansion in research and development activities and higher stock-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the number of options granted during the year and an increase in the fair value of our common stock affecting the valuation of new option grants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $7.5 million, or, 87.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was mainly due to increases of $3.9 million in personnel-related costs related to higher stock-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the number of options granted during the year and an increase in the fair value of our common stock affecting the valuation of new option grants, as well as growth in the number of employees in our general and administrative functions, $1.6 million in professional and consulting services resulting from increased legal expenses and consulting costs, and $1.7 million in other expenses primarily due to an increase in directors and officers insurance expense as a result of being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net decreased by $3.5 million, or, 90.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. During 2019, we recognized a $3.2 million gain resulting from a change in the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability, which was settled in December 2019, and there was no such gain recognized during 2020. Other income (expense), net also decreased due to an increase in foreign currency losses of $2.2 million resulting from the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Swiss Franc. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.2 million in grant income from the CARB-X program, which commenced in July 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through December 31, 2021, we have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations and have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock totaling approximately $583.9 million in aggregate gross proceeds and $559.1 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, we had $69.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, $204.1 million in investments and an accumulated deficit of $298.6 million.\nOn July 2, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, or the Shelf Registration Statement, under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities or warrants. The Shelf Registration Statement became automatically effective upon the filing of the Form S-3ASR on July 2, 2021.\nIn July 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales AgreementSM, or the ATM Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement, we may elect to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million through Jefferies acting as our sales agent or principal. Under the ATM Sales Agreement, Jefferies may sell the shares of common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at-the-market offering\u201d as defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in block transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions with our consent. Jefferies will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares of common stock subject to the ATM Sales Agreement from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions that we may impose). We will pay Jefferies a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Jefferies under the ATM Sales Agreement; however, we are not obligated to make any sales of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we have sold 567,045 shares of our common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement at an average price of $25.26 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $14.3 million ($13.9 million net of commissions and offering expenses).\nIn January 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, and received approximately $93.5 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. In February 2022, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of common stock, and we received approximately $14.1 million in additional net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, which consist primarily of research and development expenses related to our programs, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. We anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our current vaccine candidates through research, development and manufacturing, continue our research initiatives to develop new vaccine candidates, scale our laboratory and manufacturing operations and expand our corporate infrastructure, including the costs associated with being a public company. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new drug candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we will need to raise additional capital prior to commencing pivotal trials for any of our vaccine candidates. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our vaccine candidates or from collaboration agreements with third parties, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. The sale of equity, pre-funded warrants or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Debt financings may subject us to covenant limitations or restrictions on our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed or on terms favorable or acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing, scope, progress, results and costs of research and development, testing, screening, manufacturing, preclinical development and clinical studies and clinical trials, including any impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform field efficacy studies for our PCV candidates, require more studies than those that we currently expect or change their requirements regarding the data required to support a marketing application;\n\u2022the cost of building a sales force in anticipation of any product commercialization;\n\u2022the costs of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, royalties and distribution, for any of our vaccine candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due under any such agreement;\n\u2022any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n\u2022the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales, or sales to foreign governments, of our vaccine candidates for which we may receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company; and\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate the magnitude of the factors discussed above.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of our vaccine candidates. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such change.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121,393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,195\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(316,344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,114\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $121.4 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of $100.1 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $37.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $15.7 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities of $37.0 million was primarily due to decreases in cash flows due to operating lease liabilities of $12.9 million resulting from leasehold improvements costs applied against such liabilities upon the commencement of our San Carlos office lease in December 2021; accounts payable of $12.5 million resulting primarily from the payment of deferred Lonza payables in December 2021; accrued manufacturing expenses of $8.6 million resulting from timing of payments; and prepaid and other current assets of $7.4 million related to a receivable for reimbursement of tenant improvement allowance and prepayments on various contracts, including repairs and maintenance, production of critical raw materials, research and clinical trial preparation. These changes were partially offset by increases in cash flows due to accrued expenses of $4.6 million primarily related to costs associated with the manufacture of extract in connection with our relationship with Sutro Biopharma. Non-cash charges consisted of $10.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $1.7 million in amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets and $1.4 million in net amortization of premiums on investments.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $46.6 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of $89.2 million, partially offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $35.3 million and non-cash charges of $7.3 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities of $35.3 million was primarily due to increases in accounts payable of $26.1 million resulting from the deferral of completion\npayments until April 2021 in accordance with our contract with Lonza, accrued manufacturing expenses of $7.2 million related to outsourced manufacturing activities and accrued expenses of $2.2 million related primarily to increases in contract research services related to the VAX-24 program. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $5.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $0.3 million in asset impairment charges.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $47.1 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of $50.3 million and net non-cash charges of $0.8 million, partially offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of a $3.2 million decrease in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liabilities primarily related to a reduction in the time to maturity during the year and the settlement of the Series C tranche liability in December 2019, partially offset by $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. The net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million was primarily due increases of $4.7 million in accrued liabilities resulting primarily from our increased contract manufacturing activities in 2019 and $0.9 million in accounts payable resulting from timing of billings and payments, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.8 million decrease in accrued compensation due primarily to the timing of the payment of our annual performance bonuses and a $0.7 million in prepaid expenditures mainly related to contract manufacturing activities, contract research services and maintenance contracts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $212.3 million, which related primarily to $336.3 million in purchases of investments and $6.6 million in purchases of lab equipment and furniture and fixtures, partially offset by $100.5 million in maturities of investments and $30.1 million in sales of investments.\nCash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $$1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which related primarily to purchases of lab equipment and leasehold improvements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $17.8 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from shares issued under our ATM Sales Agreement of $13.9 million, proceeds from exercises of common stock options of $3.0 million and proceeds from shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $0.9 million.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $374.9 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $264.0 million from our IPO and $109.9 million from the issuance of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $41.6 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the second tranche of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock of $42.5 million, partially offset by deferred offering costs of $1.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nLeases\nWe have operating lease agreements for our office spaces. As of December 31, 2021, we had lease payment obligations totaling $20.3 million.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe have certain payment obligations under various license agreements. Under these agreements, we are required to make milestone payments upon successful completion and achievement of certain intellectual property, clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. The payment obligations under the license agreements are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, and we will be required to make development milestone payments and royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under these agreements. As the achievement and timing of these future milestone payments are not probable or estimable, such amounts have not been included in our balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. See Note 14, Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors for preclinical, clinical and non-clinical studies, manufacturing and supply of our preclinical and clinical materials and for other services and products used for operating purposes. These contracts are generally cancelable following a certain period after written notice, and therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, stock-based compensation and leases. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nWe have entered into various agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and clinical research organizations, or CROs. As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses, including accrued manufacturing expenses, as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and third parties to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe accrue for costs related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors, including CMOs, that conduct research, development and manufacturing on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a\nprepayment of the research and development expense. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining accrued research and development liabilities as of each reporting period based on the estimated time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense related to awards to employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, net of the impact of actual forfeitures recorded in the period in which they occur.\nStock-based compensation expense related to awards to non-employees is recognized based on the then-current fair value at each measurement date over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term, using the straight-line method. The fair value of non-employee stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with assumptions generally consistent with those used for employee stock options, with the exception of the expected term, which is the remaining contractual life at each measurement date. Refer to Notes 2 and 10 for more information on assumptions used in estimating stock-based compensation expense.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, such as volatility, which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. The assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nExpected Term\nExpected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term for employee equity instruments is calculated using the simplified method where there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. For awards with multiple vesting-tranches, the time from grant until the mid-points for each of the tranches may be averaged to provide an overall expected term. The expected term for non-employee stock options is the remaining contractual term.\nExpected Volatility\nExpected volatility is estimated from the average historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within the life sciences industry that are considered to be comparable to our business over a period approximately equal to the expected term for employees' options and the remaining contractual life for non-employees' options. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.\nExpected Dividend\nWe have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. Accordingly, we have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon notes with remaining terms corresponding with the expected term of the option.\nFair Value of Common Stock\nFor valuations after the completion of our IPO, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nLeases\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective transition approach. There was no cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings upon adoption.\nUnder ASC 842, we assess all arrangements that convey the right to control the use of property, plant and equipment, at inception, to determine if it is, or contains, a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangements. In addition, we determine whether leases meet the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease at the lease commencement date considering: (1) whether the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (2) whether the lease contains a bargain purchase option, (3) whether the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) whether the present value of the sum of the lease payments and residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, and (5) whether the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. As of December 31, 2021, our lease population consisted only of operating real estate leases.\nOnce a lease is identified and its classification determined, we recognize a right-of-use, or ROU, asset and a corresponding lease liability. Lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected least term. The corresponding ROU asset is measured from the initial lease liability, adjusted by (i) accrued or prepaid rents, (ii) remaining unamortized initial direct costs and lease incentives, and (iii) any impairments of the ROU asset.\nSignificant assumptions utilized in recognizing the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities included the expected lease term and the incremental borrowing rate. The expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and, as applicable, extensions of the lease term when we have determined the exercise of the option to extend is reasonably certain to occur. The incremental borrowing rate was utilized to discount lease payments over the expected term given our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate. We estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of corporate bond yields with a credit rating similar to us. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires management judgment, including development of a synthetic credit rating and cost of debt, as we currently do not carry any debt. We believe that the estimates used in determining the incremental borrowing rate are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances.\nFor additional details regarding the impact of adoption and disclosure, see Note 5, Leases,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our financial statements for additional information.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company's financial condition and operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. We are developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, our system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate our ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Our pipeline includes pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, candidates that we believe are among the most broad-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the approximately $7 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, or IPD, and pneumonia. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared our investigational new drug, or IND, application for VAX-24. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study in adults aged 18 to 64. We expect to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study by the end of 2022. Pending the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of this study, we expect to begin enrollment in a separate Phase 2 study in healthy adults aged 65 and older and to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2023. We also anticipate submitting our first VAX-24 pediatric IND application to the FDA in the first half of 2023, subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and successful topline results from the VAX-24 Phase 1/2 study in adults aged 18 to 64. Our second PCV candidate, VAX-XP, leverages our scalable and modular platform and builds on the technical proof of concept established by VAX-24 and is designed to expand the breadth of coverage to greater than 30 strains without compromising immunogenicity due to carrier suppression. In addition to our PCV franchise, we are developing a novel conjugate vaccine candidate for Group A Strep and a novel protein vaccine candidate targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis.\nSince January 1, 2021, key developments affecting our business include the following:\n\u2022Completed the Manufacture of VAX-24 Drug Product: In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed all steps in the manufacturing process, including formulation, fill and finish, along with the testing and release, for the VAX-24 drug product. This achievement led to the submission of the VAX-24 IND application to the FDA before the end of 2021.\n\u2022Dosed First Participants in VAX-24 Phase 1/2 Clinical Study: Following the early January 2022 clearance of the VAX-24 IND application, we initiated the Phase 1/2 clinical study of VAX-24, a 24-valent PCV candidate designed to prevent IPD and pneumonia in adults. The VAX-24 clinical proof-of-concept study is a randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding, controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy adults. The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 64 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a\nsingle injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 800 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age. The prespecified immunogenicity endpoints of the Phase 2 portion of the study include an assessment of the induction of antibody responses, using immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA), at each of the VAX-24 doses and compared to Prevnar 20 and, for the additional four serotypes contained in VAX-24 and Pneumovax 23 but not in Prevnar 20, the four-fold rise in antibody titers.\n\u2022Completed Successful $115 Million Follow-On Financing: In the first quarter of 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,250,000 shares of our common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $20.00 per share, and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of $19.999 per underlying share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the offering were $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, and excluding the exercise of any pre-funded warrants.\n\u2022Advanced and Presented Preclinical Data for VAX-XP Program: We have continued to advance VAX-XP, our PCV candidate with an expanded breadth of coverage of greater than 30 strains. During IDWeek 2021, we presented findings from a preclinical study that evaluated the immunogenicity of VAX-XP, which showed VAX-XP exhibited conjugate-like immune responses for all 31 serotypes, as demonstrated by IgG immune responses 14 days after both an initial and booster dose that were superior to polysaccharide-based vaccines and comparable to Prevnar 13. Additionally, all serotypes in VAX-XP elicited a T-cell dependent immune response as demonstrated by the increase in IgG titers post-boost.\n\u2022Initiated VAX-A1 IND-Enabling Activities. We continue to advance development of VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine designed to prevent infections caused by Group A Streptococcus, or Strep, bacteria. Following the nomination of our final VAX-A1 vaccine candidate in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2021.\n\u2022Strengthened Leadership Team and Board of Directors with Key Appointments: During 2021, we added several key leaders to our executive team and Board of Directors. In October, Harp Dhaliwal joined as Senior Vice President of Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and we appointed Dr. Carlos Paya, who serves as the Board Chair, and Dr. Michael Kamarck to our board of directors. This followed the September 2021 board appointments of Annie Drapeau and Teri Loxam. These accomplished industry leaders have deep experience across the biopharmaceutical and vaccine industries and will provide additional skills and expertise as we advance and scale our business.\nSince our inception in November 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our vaccine candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending in\nlarge part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. Our net losses were $100.1 million and $89.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $298.6 million and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $273.1. million, We believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our vaccine candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022advance our vaccine candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022require the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022require the manufacture of supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, in particular our PCV candidates, VAX-24 and VAX-XP;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022hire additional personnel;\n\u2022operate as a public company;\n\u2022acquire, discover, validate and develop additional vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our vaccine candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates, we also would expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with vaccine development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our vaccines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nCertain Significant Relationships\nSutro Biopharma\nVaxcyte was formed through its relationship with Sutro Biopharma, in 2013 by our co-founders with the goal of utilizing Sutro Biopharma's proprietary XpressCF platform for protein synthesis in the field of vaccines addressing infectious diseases.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we entered into a license agreement with Sutro Biopharma, or the Sutro License, on August 1, 2014. The Sutro License was amended on October 12, 2015 and again on May 9, 2018 and May 29, 2018. Under this license, we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Sutro Biopharma's patents and know-how relating to cell-free expression of proteins to (i) research, develop, use,\nsell, offer for sale, export, import and otherwise exploit specified vaccine compositions, such rights being sublicensable, for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases, excluding cancer vaccines, and (ii) manufacture, or have manufactured by an approved contract manufacturing organization, such vaccine compositions from extracts supplied by Sutro Biopharma pursuant to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement (as described below). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize the vaccine compositions. In consideration of the rights granted under the Sutro License, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a 4% royalty on worldwide aggregate net sales of vaccine products for human health and a 2% royalty on such net sales of vaccine products for animal health. Such royalty rates are subject to specified reductions, including standard reductions for third-party payments and for expiration of relevant patent claims. Royalties are payable on a vaccine composition-by-vaccine composition and country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering such vaccine composition in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such vaccine composition. In addition, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a percentage in the low-double digits of any net sublicensing revenue received for sublicense agreements executed before July 2020. Our obligation to pay sublicense fees to Sutro Biopharma expired in July 2020.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a supply agreement, which we refer to as the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement, with Sutro Biopharma pursuant to which we purchase from Sutro Biopharma extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing non-clinical and certain clinical supply of vaccine compositions utilizing the technology licensed under the Sutro License at prices not to exceed a specified percentage above Sutro Biopharma's fully burdened manufacturing cost. If any extracts or custom reagents do not meet the specifications and warranties provided, then we will not have an obligation to pay for the non-conforming product, and Sutro Biopharma will be obligated to replace the non-conforming product within the shortest possible time with conforming product at our cost. The term of the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement is from execution until the later of July 31, 2021 and the date the parties enter into and commence activities under the supply agreement unless extended through a subsequent supply agreement for the supply of extract and custom reagents for vaccine compositions for Phase 3 and commercial uses as contemplated in the Supply Agreement. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement and extended the term to July 31, 2022.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Sutro Biopharma, see Note 14, Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLonza\nIn October 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement, as amended, with Lonza Ltd., or the Lonza DMSA, pursuant to which Lonza Ltd., or Lonza, is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture of components for VAX-24, including the polysaccharide antigens, our proprietary eCRM protein carrier and conjugated drug substances.\nIn September 2017, we and Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments for any stage that commenced after December 31, 2019 or had not been completed by December 31, 2019 until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2020. In March 2020, Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or April 30, 2021. In April 2021, Lonza further agreed to defer 50% of the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2018, we entered into a letter agreement with Lonza, pursuant to which we agreed to certain terms for potential future payments in shares of our common stock as partial satisfaction of future obligations to Lonza. Specifically, we and Lonza agreed that the initial pre-IND cash payments made by us to Lonza would be subject to a specified dollar cap, which we refer to as the Initial Cash Cap. After the Initial Cash Cap has been reached, then at our election, we would have the option to make any further pre-IND payments owed to Lonza in cash, in shares of our common stock at then market prevailing prices, or a combination of both, provided that (i) Lonza had the right to elect to receive up to 25% of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock, up to a maximum of $2.5 million, and (ii) we had the right to issue no more than $10.0 million of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock. In April 2021, we reached the Initial Cash Cap and notified Lonza that we would be exercising our option to issue approximately $10.0 million in shares of our common stock as payment for a portion\nof pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021. In June 2021, we issued 399,680 shares of our common stock to Lonza at a price of $25.02 per share to pay for $10.0 million of the pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a second development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, or the Lonza 2018 DMSA, and together with the Lonza DMSA, or the Lonza Agreements, pursuant to which Lonza is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture and supply of VAX-24 finished drug product.\nUnder the Lonza Agreements, we will pay Lonza agreed upon fees for Lonza's performance of manufacturing services, and we will reimburse Lonza for its out-of-pocket costs associated with purchasing raw materials, plus a customary handling fee. Each Lonza Agreement is managed by a steering committee and any dispute at the steering committee will be resolved by senior executives of the parties.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Lonza, see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and to maintain business continuity. We believe that the measures we have implemented and continue to implement are appropriate, and we will continue to monitor and seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for our non-lab based employees in March 2020, while maintaining essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite safety procedures, including routine testing of employees. In 2021, we began to allow non-lab employees who have been fully vaccinated to return to the office on a voluntary and limited basis. In addition, we have recently implemented requirements for employees to obtain COVID-19 booster shots.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed raw material supply chains and travel restrictions delayed the qualification of key analytical equipment used in manufacturing and curtailed in-person CMO oversight of manufacturing, affecting our manufacturing processes. As the pandemic continues, we could see an additional impact on our ability to advance our programs, obtain supplies from our contract manufacturers or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, employee resources or otherwise. In any event, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the continued spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the potential value of our common stock.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development and regulatory efforts, our ability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and the value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and include personnel-related costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) for our personnel in research and development functions; costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing supplies for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other studies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations; costs and expenses related to agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants to conduct non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials; professional and consulting services costs; research and development consumables costs; laboratory supplies and equipment costs; and facility and other allocated costs.\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed. We do not allocate our costs by vaccine candidates, as our vaccine candidates are at an early stage of development and our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, which are not tracked by vaccine candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple vaccine candidate research and development programs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our vaccine candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, scale up our manufacturing operations, pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates and expand our pipeline of vaccine candidates. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research and developing the necessary manufacturing capabilities to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our vaccine candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our vaccine candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or if, when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our vaccine candidates.\nWe accrue for costs related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors, including contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. Advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining accrued research and development liabilities as of each reporting period based on the estimated time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nOur research and development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\n\u2022the costs and timing of our chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, activities, including fulfilling GMP-related standards and compliance, and identifying and qualifying a second supplier;\n\u2022the costs related to raw materials estimates from our third-party manufacturing and supply partners;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our vaccine candidates being greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u2022the number of sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n\u2022delays in adding a sufficient number of trial sites and recruiting suitable volunteers to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the number of subjects that participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses that subjects receive;\n\u2022subjects dropping out of a study or lost in follow-up;\n\u2022potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;\n\u2022the cost and timing of manufacturing our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022the phase of development of our vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses related to personnel (including salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) in our executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions; legal services, including relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; accounting, auditing, consulting and tax services; insurance; and facility and other allocated costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities and grow our business. We also anticipate that we will incur increased expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with SEC rules and regulations and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest expense incurred on our capital leases for lab equipment, interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, grant income, foreign currency transaction gains (losses) related to our Swiss Franc cash and liability balances and changes in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability (see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 3, Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 7, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail).\nGrant Income\nIn July 2019, we received a cost-reimbursement research award from Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, a public-private partnership funded under a Cooperative Agreement from Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response/Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and by awards from Wellcome Trust, Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the United Kingdom Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program, or the CARB-X agreement. CARB-X awarded us up to $1.6 million in initial funding to advance the development of a universal vaccine to prevent infections caused by Group A Strep Bacteria. In July 2020, the CARB-X agreement was amended with the initial funding amount increased from $1.6 million to $2.7 million. In December 2020, we reached the maximum CARB-X funding limit for this initial funding period, and subsequently submitted our funding proposal to CARB-X for the next period under our agreement. In April 2021, we received approval for the next phase of CARB-X development and executed the cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University in August 2021. Pursuant to the CARB-X agreement, the award committed additional funding of $3.2 million for IND-enabling activities and total potential funding of up to $29.7 million (including the current $3.2 million award and the prior $2.7 million award) upon the achievement of future VAX-A1 development milestones. In January 2022, CARB-X revised the parameters for the contribution of CARB-X funding and implemented maximum funding levels for all grant recipients. As a result, our total funding available upon achievement of development milestones through Phase 1 human clinical trials was revised from $29.7 million to $13.9 million (inclusive of the $5.9 million awarded to date). Separately, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, awarded us up to $0.5 million in April 2021 to advance the development of a vaccine against Shigella infection. Grant income pursuant to our award agreements is recognized as we incur and pay qualifying expenses over the periods of the awards. We recognized $1.6 million, $2.5 million and $0.2 million in grant income for funding research and development under these awards during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Grant income is included as a component of Other income (expense), net in the statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. We are developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, our system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate our ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Our pipeline includes pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, candidates that we believe are among the most broad-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the approximately $7 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, or IPD, and pneumonia. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared our investigational new drug, or IND, application for VAX-24. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study in adults aged 18 to 64. We expect to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study by the end of 2022. Pending the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of this study, we expect to begin enrollment in a separate Phase 2 study in healthy adults aged 65 and older and to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2023. We also anticipate submitting our first VAX-24 pediatric IND application to the FDA in the first half of 2023, subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and successful topline results from the VAX-24 Phase 1/2 study in adults aged 18 to 64. Our second PCV candidate, VAX-XP, leverages our scalable and modular platform and builds on the technical proof of concept established by VAX-24 and is designed to expand the breadth of coverage to greater than 30 strains without compromising immunogenicity due to carrier suppression. In addition to our PCV franchise, we are developing a novel conjugate vaccine candidate for Group A Strep and a novel protein vaccine candidate targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis.\nSince January 1, 2021, key developments affecting our business include the following:\n\u2022Completed the Manufacture of VAX-24 Drug Product: In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed all steps in the manufacturing process, including formulation, fill and finish, along with the testing and release, for the VAX-24 drug product. This achievement led to the submission of the VAX-24 IND application to the FDA before the end of 2021.\n\u2022Dosed First Participants in VAX-24 Phase 1/2 Clinical Study: Following the early January 2022 clearance of the VAX-24 IND application, we initiated the Phase 1/2 clinical study of VAX-24, a 24-valent PCV candidate designed to prevent IPD and pneumonia in adults. The VAX-24 clinical proof-of-concept study is a randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding, controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy adults. The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 64 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a\nsingle injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels and compared to Prevnar 20 in approximately 800 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age. The prespecified immunogenicity endpoints of the Phase 2 portion of the study include an assessment of the induction of antibody responses, using immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA), at each of the VAX-24 doses and compared to Prevnar 20 and, for the additional four serotypes contained in VAX-24 and Pneumovax 23 but not in Prevnar 20, the four-fold rise in antibody titers.\n\u2022Completed Successful $115 Million Follow-On Financing: In the first quarter of 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,250,000 shares of our common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $20.00 per share, and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of $19.999 per underlying share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the offering were $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, and excluding the exercise of any pre-funded warrants.\n\u2022Advanced and Presented Preclinical Data for VAX-XP Program: We have continued to advance VAX-XP, our PCV candidate with an expanded breadth of coverage of greater than 30 strains. During IDWeek 2021, we presented findings from a preclinical study that evaluated the immunogenicity of VAX-XP, which showed VAX-XP exhibited conjugate-like immune responses for all 31 serotypes, as demonstrated by IgG immune responses 14 days after both an initial and booster dose that were superior to polysaccharide-based vaccines and comparable to Prevnar 13. Additionally, all serotypes in VAX-XP elicited a T-cell dependent immune response as demonstrated by the increase in IgG titers post-boost.\n\u2022Initiated VAX-A1 IND-Enabling Activities. We continue to advance development of VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine designed to prevent infections caused by Group A Streptococcus, or Strep, bacteria. Following the nomination of our final VAX-A1 vaccine candidate in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2021.\n\u2022Strengthened Leadership Team and Board of Directors with Key Appointments: During 2021, we added several key leaders to our executive team and Board of Directors. In October, Harp Dhaliwal joined as Senior Vice President of Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and we appointed Dr. Carlos Paya, who serves as the Board Chair, and Dr. Michael Kamarck to our board of directors. This followed the September 2021 board appointments of Annie Drapeau and Teri Loxam. These accomplished industry leaders have deep experience across the biopharmaceutical and vaccine industries and will provide additional skills and expertise as we advance and scale our business.\nSince our inception in November 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our vaccine candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending in\nlarge part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. Our net losses were $100.1 million and $89.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $298.6 million and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $273.1. million, We believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our vaccine candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022advance our vaccine candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022require the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022require the manufacture of supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, in particular our PCV candidates, VAX-24 and VAX-XP;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022hire additional personnel;\n\u2022operate as a public company;\n\u2022acquire, discover, validate and develop additional vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our vaccine candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates, we also would expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with vaccine development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our vaccines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nCertain Significant Relationships\nSutro Biopharma\nVaxcyte was formed through its relationship with Sutro Biopharma, in 2013 by our co-founders with the goal of utilizing Sutro Biopharma's proprietary XpressCF platform for protein synthesis in the field of vaccines addressing infectious diseases.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we entered into a license agreement with Sutro Biopharma, or the Sutro License, on August 1, 2014. The Sutro License was amended on October 12, 2015 and again on May 9, 2018 and May 29, 2018. Under this license, we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Sutro Biopharma's patents and know-how relating to cell-free expression of proteins to (i) research, develop, use,\nsell, offer for sale, export, import and otherwise exploit specified vaccine compositions, such rights being sublicensable, for the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases, excluding cancer vaccines, and (ii) manufacture, or have manufactured by an approved contract manufacturing organization, such vaccine compositions from extracts supplied by Sutro Biopharma pursuant to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement (as described below). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize the vaccine compositions. In consideration of the rights granted under the Sutro License, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a 4% royalty on worldwide aggregate net sales of vaccine products for human health and a 2% royalty on such net sales of vaccine products for animal health. Such royalty rates are subject to specified reductions, including standard reductions for third-party payments and for expiration of relevant patent claims. Royalties are payable on a vaccine composition-by-vaccine composition and country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering such vaccine composition in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such vaccine composition. In addition, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a percentage in the low-double digits of any net sublicensing revenue received for sublicense agreements executed before July 2020. Our obligation to pay sublicense fees to Sutro Biopharma expired in July 2020.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a supply agreement, which we refer to as the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement, with Sutro Biopharma pursuant to which we purchase from Sutro Biopharma extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing non-clinical and certain clinical supply of vaccine compositions utilizing the technology licensed under the Sutro License at prices not to exceed a specified percentage above Sutro Biopharma's fully burdened manufacturing cost. If any extracts or custom reagents do not meet the specifications and warranties provided, then we will not have an obligation to pay for the non-conforming product, and Sutro Biopharma will be obligated to replace the non-conforming product within the shortest possible time with conforming product at our cost. The term of the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement is from execution until the later of July 31, 2021 and the date the parties enter into and commence activities under the supply agreement unless extended through a subsequent supply agreement for the supply of extract and custom reagents for vaccine compositions for Phase 3 and commercial uses as contemplated in the Supply Agreement. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement and extended the term to July 31, 2022.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Sutro Biopharma, see Note 14, Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLonza\nIn October 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement, as amended, with Lonza Ltd., or the Lonza DMSA, pursuant to which Lonza Ltd., or Lonza, is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture of components for VAX-24, including the polysaccharide antigens, our proprietary eCRM protein carrier and conjugated drug substances.\nIn September 2017, we and Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments for any stage that commenced after December 31, 2019 or had not been completed by December 31, 2019 until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2020. In March 2020, Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or April 30, 2021. In April 2021, Lonza further agreed to defer 50% of the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2018, we entered into a letter agreement with Lonza, pursuant to which we agreed to certain terms for potential future payments in shares of our common stock as partial satisfaction of future obligations to Lonza. Specifically, we and Lonza agreed that the initial pre-IND cash payments made by us to Lonza would be subject to a specified dollar cap, which we refer to as the Initial Cash Cap. After the Initial Cash Cap has been reached, then at our election, we would have the option to make any further pre-IND payments owed to Lonza in cash, in shares of our common stock at then market prevailing prices, or a combination of both, provided that (i) Lonza had the right to elect to receive up to 25% of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock, up to a maximum of $2.5 million, and (ii) we had the right to issue no more than $10.0 million of pre-IND payments in shares of our common stock. In April 2021, we reached the Initial Cash Cap and notified Lonza that we would be exercising our option to issue approximately $10.0 million in shares of our common stock as payment for a portion\nof pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021. In June 2021, we issued 399,680 shares of our common stock to Lonza at a price of $25.02 per share to pay for $10.0 million of the pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a second development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, or the Lonza 2018 DMSA, and together with the Lonza DMSA, or the Lonza Agreements, pursuant to which Lonza is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture and supply of VAX-24 finished drug product.\nUnder the Lonza Agreements, we will pay Lonza agreed upon fees for Lonza's performance of manufacturing services, and we will reimburse Lonza for its out-of-pocket costs associated with purchasing raw materials, plus a customary handling fee. Each Lonza Agreement is managed by a steering committee and any dispute at the steering committee will be resolved by senior executives of the parties.\nFor additional details regarding our relationship with Lonza, see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and to maintain business continuity. We believe that the measures we have implemented and continue to implement are appropriate, and we will continue to monitor and seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for our non-lab based employees in March 2020, while maintaining essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite safety procedures, including routine testing of employees. In 2021, we began to allow non-lab employees who have been fully vaccinated to return to the office on a voluntary and limited basis. In addition, we have recently implemented requirements for employees to obtain COVID-19 booster shots.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed raw material supply chains and travel restrictions delayed the qualification of key analytical equipment used in manufacturing and curtailed in-person CMO oversight of manufacturing, affecting our manufacturing processes. As the pandemic continues, we could see an additional impact on our ability to advance our programs, obtain supplies from our contract manufacturers or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, employee resources or otherwise. In any event, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the continued spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the potential value of our common stock.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development and regulatory efforts, our ability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and the value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and include personnel-related costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) for our personnel in research and development functions; costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing supplies for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other studies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations; costs and expenses related to agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants to conduct non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials; professional and consulting services costs; research and development consumables costs; laboratory supplies and equipment costs; and facility and other allocated costs.\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed. We do not allocate our costs by vaccine candidates, as our vaccine candidates are at an early stage of development and our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, which are not tracked by vaccine candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple vaccine candidate research and development programs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our vaccine candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, scale up our manufacturing operations, pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates and expand our pipeline of vaccine candidates. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research and developing the necessary manufacturing capabilities to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our vaccine candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our vaccine candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or if, when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our vaccine candidates.\nWe accrue for costs related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors, including contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. Advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining accrued research and development liabilities as of each reporting period based on the estimated time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nOur research and development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\n\u2022the costs and timing of our chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, activities, including fulfilling GMP-related standards and compliance, and identifying and qualifying a second supplier;\n\u2022the costs related to raw materials estimates from our third-party manufacturing and supply partners;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our vaccine candidates being greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u2022the number of sites included in the trials;\n\u2022the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n\u2022delays in adding a sufficient number of trial sites and recruiting suitable volunteers to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the number of subjects that participate in the trials;\n\u2022the number of doses that subjects receive;\n\u2022subjects dropping out of a study or lost in follow-up;\n\u2022potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;\n\u2022the cost and timing of manufacturing our vaccine candidates;\n\u2022the phase of development of our vaccine candidates; and\n\u2022the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses related to personnel (including salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation) in our executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions; legal services, including relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; accounting, auditing, consulting and tax services; insurance; and facility and other allocated costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development activities and grow our business. We also anticipate that we will incur increased expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with SEC rules and regulations and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes interest expense incurred on our capital leases for lab equipment, interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, grant income, foreign currency transaction gains (losses) related to our Swiss Franc cash and liability balances and changes in the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability (see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Note 3, Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d and Note 7, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock,\u201d to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail).\nGrant Income\nIn July 2019, we received a cost-reimbursement research award from Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, a public-private partnership funded under a Cooperative Agreement from Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response/Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and by awards from Wellcome Trust, Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the United Kingdom Global Antimicrobial Resistance Innovation Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program, or the CARB-X agreement. CARB-X awarded us up to $1.6 million in initial funding to advance the development of a universal vaccine to prevent infections caused by Group A Strep Bacteria. In July 2020, the CARB-X agreement was amended with the initial funding amount increased from $1.6 million to $2.7 million. In December 2020, we reached the maximum CARB-X funding limit for this initial funding period, and subsequently submitted our funding proposal to CARB-X for the next period under our agreement. In April 2021, we received approval for the next phase of CARB-X development and executed the cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University in August 2021. Pursuant to the CARB-X agreement, the award committed additional funding of $3.2 million for IND-enabling activities and total potential funding of up to $29.7 million (including the current $3.2 million award and the prior $2.7 million award) upon the achievement of future VAX-A1 development milestones. In January 2022, CARB-X revised the parameters for the contribution of CARB-X funding and implemented maximum funding levels for all grant recipients. As a result, our total funding available upon achievement of development milestones through Phase 1 human clinical trials was revised from $29.7 million to $13.9 million (inclusive of the $5.9 million awarded to date). Separately, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, awarded us up to $0.5 million in April 2021 to advance the development of a vaccine against Shigella infection. Grant income pursuant to our award agreements is recognized as we incur and pay qualifying expenses over the periods of the awards. We recognized $1.6 million, $2.5 million and $0.2 million in grant income for funding research and development under these awards during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Grant income is included as a component of Other income (expense), net in the statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,581\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
