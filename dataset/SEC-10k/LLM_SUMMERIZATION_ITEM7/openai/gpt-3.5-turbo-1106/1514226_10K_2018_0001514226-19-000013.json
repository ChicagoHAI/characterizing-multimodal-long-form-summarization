MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to fiscal years of the United States government pertain to their fiscal year, which ends on September 30th of each year.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading global services provider offering unique, tailored solutions for an ever-changing world. Built on approximately seven decades of experience as a trusted partner to commercial, government and military customers, we provide sophisticated aviation solutions, law enforcement training and support, base and logistics operations, intelligence training, rule of law development, construction management, international development, ground vehicle support, counter-narcotics aviation, platform services and operations and linguist services. Our current customers include the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Department of State (\"DoS\"), the U.S. Agency for International Development (\"USAID\"), foreign governments, commercial customers and certain other U.S. federal, state and local government departments and agencies.\nDelta Tucker Holdings, Inc. was formed for the purpose of acquiring DynCorp International Inc. (\"DynCorp International\") and had immaterial assets and virtually no operations prior to the merger on July 7, 2010, except for the costs associated with acquiring DynCorp International. Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. remains the holding company of DynCorp International. DynCorp International wholly owns DynCorp International LLC, which functions as the operating company.\nThe Company's organizational structure includes two operating and reporting segments: DynAviation and DynLogistics. The DynAviation and DynLogistics segments operate principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\") and audits by various U.S. federal agencies.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we employed or managed approximately 13,200 personnel, including approximately 5,700 personnel from our affiliates. We operate in approximately 30 countries through approximately 46 active contracts and 60 active task orders.\nCurrent Operating Environment and Outlook\nExternal Factors\nOur business is primarily derived from U.S. government contracts to support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives around the globe. Federal spending for these activities combined with capabilities with policy priorities, guide our ability to grow the business. The industry welcomed the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which added $165 billion in defense spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The stability and predictability provided by this budget deal created a positive business environment and spurred growth in the defense services sector.\nFor fiscal year 2019, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") was appropriated $675 billion which is a $20 billion increase over fiscal year 2018. Funding continues to be directed toward programs and activities that restore readiness and ensure the future readiness of the force, to include increased purchasing of parts, training, flight hours and other readiness enablers. Looking to fiscal year 2020, the President has indicated that the national defense request will be approximately $750 billion. If so, this request which includes DoD, as well as funding for the Department of Energy, Department of Justice and other agencies, would be the third consecutive year of compounding increases in national defense spending.\nGrowth in the defense budget combined with the prioritization of readiness and ongoing operations aligns with our core offerings and favors continued growth. Still, U.S. policy and budget decisions do not exist in a vacuum, and global events shape adjustments to policies, as well as the funding levels and mechanisms to support these shifts. External factors influencing the industry continue to include:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased competition and opportunity caused by IDIQs and other bidding trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Readiness-driven requirements to maintain and sustain equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Budget Control Act (\"BCA\") mandated caps on defense spending;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Disruptions to funding caused by a government shutdown or a continuing resolution;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Troop levels, mission requirements and tempo of operations in Afghanistan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Geopolitical environment in Iraq, Syria and the wider Middle East;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North Korea's nuclear program and challenging behavior; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Russian aggression in Europe and the Middle East.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Legislatively, we believe the recent appropriations agreement to fund all government agencies for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 was a welcomed sign of bipartisanship. Congressional leaders have stated there is bipartisan political support to reach a new budget deal that will increase the BCA mandated caps on defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. However, timelines on when a new budget deal may be executed remain unclear and there can be no guarantees that any such deal will be achieved. If Congress is unable to reach an agreement, any funds appropriated above the existing BCA mandated caps will be subject to sequestration.\nInternationally, ongoing negotiations to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan will impact the U.S roles and missions, as well as the related force structure. To reach an agreement, the U.S. and Afghanistan governments are likely to require a NATO in-country footprint to assist with vital and necessary tasks, such as training and equipping the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces and maintaining counter-terrorism capabilities, which entails proportionate contractor support. In addition to Afghanistan, the wider geopolitical environment, even with the territorial loss of ISIS and increased dialogue on the Korean peninsula, is defined by an array of global threats and concerns that argue for continued robust Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO\") funding in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.\nWe believe the following longer-term industry trends demonstrate the continued demand for the types of services we provide:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Realignment of the military force structure, leading to increased outsourcing of non-combat functions, including life cycle;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asset management of equipment ranging from operational, immediate and depot-level maintenance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Requirement to maintain, overhaul and upgrade for returning rolling stocks and aging platforms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sustain and support forward-deployed rotational troops and equipment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growth in outsourcing by foreign allies of maintenance, supply-support, facilities management, infrastructure upgrades, and construction management related services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Current Business Environment\nOur contract vehicles typically have a base period with multiple option periods. The majority of these periods are for a term of one year, as the contract duration is the period over which the parties have present enforceable rights. We also have a strong history of being awarded a majority of the contract options. Furthermore, the significance of any one contract can change as our business expands or contracts. Additionally, as contract modifications, contract extensions or other contract actions occur, the profitability of any one contract can become more or less significant to the Company. As contracts are re-competed, there is the potential for the size, contract type, contract structure or other contract elements to materially change from the original contract resulting in significant changes to the scope, scale, profitability or magnitude of accounts receivable of the new re-competed contract as compared to the original contract. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes to our contracts could impact our future profitability.\u201d\nSince our primary customer is the U.S. federal government, we have not historically had significant issues with bad debt. However, given the continued scrutiny by the U.S. government, we could be subjected to regulatory requirements that could require audits at various points within our contracting process. An adverse finding under an audit could result in the disallowance of costs under a U.S. government contract, termination of a U.S. government contract, forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments, which could prove to be impactful to our liquidity, affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on our contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. Disapproval of our control systems could result in an adverse outcome.\nWe cannot be certain that the economic environment or other factors will not continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. We believe that our primary sources of liquidity, such as customer collections and the New Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), will enable us to continue to perform under our existing contracts and support further growth of our business. However, adverse conditions, such as a long term credit crisis or sequestration, could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional liquidity or refinance existing indebtedness at acceptable terms or at all. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Economic conditions could impact our business\" for a discussion of the risks associated with current economic conditions.\nNotable events for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to date\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In January 2018, the Company changed its three operating and reportable segments, DynLogistics, AELS and AOLC, to two operating and reportable segments: DynLogistics and DynAviation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In February 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract extension from the United States Army Contracting Command to provide advisory, training and mentoring services to the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense.

December 31, 2018 was $2,148.3 million, an increase of $143.8 million or 7.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV program and the performance of the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support, Contractor Logistics Support: C-12, C-26, UC-35 and T-6 Transport (\"CLS Transport\") and Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volume on and the completion of the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (\"INL Air Wing\") extension, the completion of the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contracts, and the completion of certain other contracts. See further discussion of our revenue results in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nCost of services - Cost of services are comprised of direct labor, direct material, overhead, subcontractors, travel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,860.8 million, an increase of $99.3 million, or 5.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cost of services was primarily driven by the increase in revenue, as discussed above. As a percentage of revenue, Cost of services improved to 86.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 87.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a reduction to our inventory reserve resulting from the sale of inventory from our T-6 COMBS contract. See further discussion of the impact of program margins in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - SG&A primarily relates to functions such as management, legal, financial accounting, contracts and administration, human resources, management information systems, purchasing and business\ndevelopment. SG&A decreased by $10.1 million, or 9.4%, to $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a reduction in consulting costs and our cost reduction initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the decrease in SG&A and increase in revenue discussed above.\nDepreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.1 million, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of our DoS customer-related intangible assets during calendar year 2017.\nEarnings from equity method investees - Earnings from equity method investees include our proportionate share of the income of our equity method investees deemed to be operationally integral to our business, such as Partnership for Temporary Housing LLC (\"PaTH\") and Global Linguist Solutions (\"GLS\"). Earnings from operationally integral unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of activity in our PaTH joint venture.\nInterest expense - Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $64.0 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 9.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in debt due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on the Term Loan, the redemption of the $39.3 million principal balance of the 10.375% Senior Notes due 2017 (the \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") in 2017 and a reduction in issued letters of credit partially offset by the PIK interest on our Second Lien Notes.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt - Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on March 21, 2018 and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on October 19, 2018 on the Term Loan. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was an immaterial amount during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $25.1 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on the Term Loan on April 4, 2017. Deferred financing costs associated with the additional prepayments were expensed and recorded to Loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest income - Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to more favorable interest rates combined with our higher cash position during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income, net - Other income, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net consists primarily of sublease income and asset sales.\nProvision for income taxes - Our effective tax rate consists of federal and state statutory rates, certain permanent differences and discrete items. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we reported a tax provision of $17.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 17.1%, as compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the federal and state tax rates applied to taxable income offset by a reduction to deferred tax assets that are subject to the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the tax reform legislation known colloquially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) and its impact on the carrying value of the valuation allowance the Company had previously recorded against its deferred tax assets. The most significant impacts of the Tax Act are a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a reduction of our deductible interest expense, the prevention of revenue deferral on unbilled receivables as well as the requirement to recognize previously deferred revenue over a four-year period under Internal Revenue Code Section 481 and to value our deferred tax assets and liabilities applying the Tax Act rates for the period in which such deferred taxes assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. See Note 5 to the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of income taxes.\nResults of Operations 2017 vs 2016\nRevenue - Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2,004.4 million, an increase of $168.3 million or 9.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV and ALiSS programs, the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support and CLS Transport contracts, and the performance of the TASM-O and the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume on the INL Air Wing program and the completion of the Sheppard Air Force Base (\"Sheppard AFB\") and Flexible Acquisition and Sustainment Tool (\"F2AST\") contracts. See further discussion of our revenue results in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nCost of services - Cost of services are comprised of direct labor, direct material, overhead, subcontractors, travel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,761.5 million, an increase of $125.2 million, or 7.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Cost of services was primarily driven by the increase in revenue, as discussed above. As a percentage of revenue, Cost of services improved to 87.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 89.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms, the completion of the Sheppard Air Force Base andAST\ncontracts and also an $8.2 million charge for the termination of a subcontractor agreement. See further discussion of the impact of program margins in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - SG&A primarily relates to functions such as management, legal, financial accounting, contracts and administration, human resources, management information systems, purchasing, and business development. SG&A decreased by $31.7 million, or 22.7%, to $107.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts and our legal and consulting costs, which were impacted by the refinancing transactions completed in June 2016 (the \"Refinancing Transactions\"), combined with our cost reduction initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the decrease in SG&A and increase in revenue as discussed above.\nDepreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.2 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 7.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of a customer-related intangible asset (\"CRI\") during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEarnings from equity method investees - Earnings from equity method investees include our proportionate share of the income of our equity method investees deemed to be operationally integral to our business, such as PaTH and GLS. Earnings from operationally integral unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of activity in our PaTH joint venture.\nImpairment of goodwill, intangibles and long lived assets - The Company did not recognize an impairment expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $1.8 million non-cash impairment charge on our investment in GLS which had a loss in value that was other than temporary.\nInterest expense - Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $70.7 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 2.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense was impacted by the change in interest rates on our new debt resulting from the Refinancing Transactions completed in the second quarter of calendar year 2016 offset by a reduction in debt due to the $25.1 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on the Term Loan and the redemption of the $39.3 million principal balance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, both in calendar year 2017, and the associated reduction in the amortization of our deferred financing costs.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt - Loss on early extinguishment of debt was insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2017. Deferred financing costs associated with the additional prepayment were expensed and recorded to Loss on early extinguishment of debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $0.3 million primarily due to the 2016 refinancing in addition to $4.6 million principal payments on the Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest income - Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million, which remained consistent compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther income, net - Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.4 million and included a favorable settlement of a legacy customer liability. Other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $4.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a multi-party settlement agreement that resolved underwriters litigation during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for income taxes - Our effective tax rate consists of federal and state statutory rates, certain permanent differences and discrete items. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we reported a tax provision of $1.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 5.1%, as compared to (23.7)% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the Tax Act and its impact on the carrying value of the valuation allowance the Company had previously recorded against its deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven primarily by an increase to the forecasted full year loss before income taxes and cancellation of debt income associated with the Refinancing Transactions which also had an impact on the valuation allowance.\nResults by Segment\nThe following tables set forth the revenue, both in dollars and as a percentage of our consolidated revenue, operating income (loss) and operating margin for our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

The change was primarily due to lower volume on, and the completion of, the INL Air Wing extension, the completion of the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contract and the completion of certain other contracts. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by the CLS Transport and Naval Test Wing Pacific contracts.\nOperating income increased to $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to more favorable terms on the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract, productivity on our Andrews Air Force Base (\"Andrews AFB\") contract and the resolution of a subcontractor matter. The increase was partially offset by decreased content on and the completion of the INL Air Wing extension and the completion of certain other contracts.\nDynLogistics\nRevenue of $1,034.0 million increased $237.8 million, or 29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV, Afghanistan Life Support Services (\"ALiSS\") and the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contracts.\nOperating income increased to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher volume as described above, the completion of certain contracts, and productivity and margin expansion across several contracts.\nResults by Segment 2017 vs 2016\nDynAviation\nRevenue of $1,208.8 million increased $6.3 million, or 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily as a result of increased content from the TASM-O, T-6 COMBS, and NAWDC contracts and new business from the CLS Transport contract. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volume on the INL Air Wing program and the completion of the Sheppard Air Force Base (\"Sheppard AFB\") contract.\nOperating income increased to $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms, a reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the performance on the NAWDC and TASM-O contracts and our Middle East contracts. These increases were partially offset by decreased content on the INL Air Wing program. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the strong performance of the INL Air Wing and the RASM-W contracts, as well as the MD530 subcontract, and a multi-party settlement agreement that resolved underwriters litigation in which we recouped $5.0 million of legal expenses.\nDynLogistics\nRevenue of $796.2 million increased $162.5 million, or 25.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the increased scope of the LOGCAP IV program, the ALiSS contract and the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract.\nOperating income decreased to $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to an $8.2 million charge for the termination of a subcontractor agreement partially offset by the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract and new task orders under the ALiSS contract.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash generated by operations and borrowings available under our New Senior Credit Facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our New Senior Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $203.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. On October 19, 2018, we made a voluntary principal payment of $50.0 million on the Term Loan. Excluding this voluntary principal payment, we have no debt retirements scheduled in the upcoming twelve-month period other than the Excess Cash Flow principal payment of $17.8 million, which we are required to make within five business days of our Form 10-K filing date (see discussion of Excess Cash Flow annual requirement below). We believe our current cash flow from operations and ability to refinance any indebtedness with upcoming maturities will be sufficient to cover our operating and capital needs for the next twelve months. However, our cash flow from operations is heavily dependent upon billing and collection of our accounts receivable and access to our class B revolving facility (the \"Revolver\"), which is dependent upon our meeting financial and non-financial covenants. The Revolver matures on July 7, 2019, so our cash flows from operations is also dependent on our ability to refinance or obtain a new revolving facility and our future financial strength. The Company is in the process of evaluating its refinancing and new credit facility opportunities.\nSignificant changes, such as future government shutdowns, further cuts mandated by sequestration or any other limitations in collections, significant future losses on any of our contracts or the inability to refinance or obtain a new revolving facility, could materially impact liquidity and our ability to fund our working capital needs. Failure to meet covenant obligations prior to its scheduled maturity could result in an earlier elimination of access to our New Senior Credit Facility or other remedies by our Agent, such as the acceleration of our debt, which would materially affect our future expansion strategies and our ability to meet our operational obligations. See further discussion of our covenants in the Financing section below.\nOur primary use of short-term liquidity includes debt service and working capital needs sufficient to pay for materials, labor, services or subcontractors prior to receiving payments from our customers. There can be no assurance that sufficient capital will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available at terms acceptable to us. Although we operate internationally, virtually all of our cash is held by either U.S. entities or by foreign entities which are structured as pass through entities. As a result, we do not have significant risk associated with our ability to repatriate cash.\nThe credit agreement governing the New Senior Credit Facility contains an annual requirement to submit a portion of our Excess Cash Flow as additional principal payments. Based on our annual financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, after taking account of the voluntary principal payment of $50.0 million on October 19, 2018, we are required to make an additional principal payment of $17.8 million under the Excess Cash Flow requirement by March 26, 2019, which we paid on March 19, 2019.\nManagement believes Days Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\") is an appropriate way to measure our billing and collections effectiveness. DSO measures the efficiency in collecting our receivables as of the period end date and is calculated based on average daily revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable and contract assets, net of contract liabilities and customer liabilities, as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, DSO was 49 days compared to 54 days, as we continued to focus on managing our customer payment cycles and due to the impact of an advanced payment from a customer during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect cash to continue to be impacted by operational working capital needs, potential acquisitions and interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nCash Flow Analysis\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(105,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows - December 31, 2018 vs December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $146.6 million as compared to $73.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to our net income, the resolution of a subcontractor matter, settlement of liabilities associated with a contract closeout, completion of certain contracts, and changes in working capital, driven primarily by a reduction in accounts receivable resulting from our continued efficiency in collecting our receivables and the receipt of a customer advance in the second quarter of calendar year 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the completion of the Sheppard AFB contract, the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the new T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms and new DynLogistics contract wins. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by changes in working capital, driven by an increase in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued payroll and employee costs.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.5 million as compared to $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to purchases of capital assets and contributions to GLS, partially offset by returns of capital from Babcock DynCorp Limited (\"Babcock\") and GLS. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to purchases of capital assets and contributions to GLS, partially offset by returns of capital from Babcock and GLS.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $105.5 million compared to $24.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of our excess cash flow payment and voluntary principal payment on the Term Loan. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of our excess cash flow payment and redemption of the Senior Unsecured Notes, partially offset by capital contributions from Cerberus.\nCash Flows - December 31, 2017 vs December 31, 2016\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $73.2 million as compared to $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the completion of the Sheppard AFB contract, the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms and new DynLogistics contract wins. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by changes in working capital, driven by an increase in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued payroll and employee costs. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to our net loss and changes in working capital, driven by a reduction in accounts receivable attributable to our DSO of 56 days partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expense.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.8 million as compared to $10.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to purchases of capital assets and contributions to GLS, partially offset by returns of capital from Babcock and GLS. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the purchases of capital assets and contributions to GLS.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $24.0 million compared to $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of our excess cash flow payment and redemption of the Senior Unsecured Notes, partially offset by capital contributions from Cerberus. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of the completion of the Refinancing Transactions.\nFinancing\nDebt consisted of the following: Table 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Issue Discount on Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Deferred Financing Costs, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount less Original Issue Discount on Term Loan and Deferred Financing Costs, Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11.875% senior secured second lien notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>77,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cerberus 3L notes\n</td> <td>34,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>496,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less current portion of long-term debt, net (1)\n</td> <td>(17,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The carrying amount of the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2018 includes our Excess Cash Flow Payment of $17.8 million, which was paid on March 19, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original Issue Discount on Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Deferred Financing Costs, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount less Original Issue Discount on Term Loan and Deferred Financing Costs, Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11.875% senior secured second lien notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan\n</td> <td>182,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cerberus 3L notes\n</td> <td>32,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>593,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,025\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less current portion of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>(54,943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 30, 2016, we entered into the Amendment No. 5 (\"Amendment No. 5\") to the Senior Credit Facility, which provided for the new senior secured credit facility (the \"New Senior Credit Facility\") upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. On June 15, 2016, we satisfied the conditions set forth in Amendment No. 5 and the New Senior Credit Facility became effective. The New Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the New Senior Credit Facility provided for the following:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $77.3 million Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the $85.8 million Revolver; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>up to $15.0 million in incremental revolving facilities provided by and at the discretion of certain non-debt fund affiliates that are controlled by Cerberus (as defined herein), which shall rank pari passu with, and be on the same terms as, the Revolver.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under the New Senior Credit Facility was approximately $66.5 million and $65.5 million, respectively, and included $19.3 million and $20.3 million, respectively, in issued letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the Revolver are used to fund operations. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 there were no amounts borrowed under the Revolver. The Revolver and the Term Loan mature on July 7, 2019 and July 7, 2020, respectively. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nWe incur quarterly interest payments on both the Term Loan and the Revolver comprised of (i) interest for Term Loan and Revolver borrowings, (ii) letter of credit commitments and (iii) unused commitment fees. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the New Senior Credit Facility.\nThe credit agreement governing the New Senior Credit Facility contains an annual requirement to submit a portion of our Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the credit agreement, as additional principal payments. Based on our annual financial results for\nthe year ended December 31, 2018, after taking account of the voluntary principal payment of $50.0 million on October 19, 2018, we are required to make an additional payment of $17.8 million under the Excess Cash Flow requirement by March 26, 2019, which we paid on March 19, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of our Second Lien Notes was $384.7 million and $379.0 million, respectively. Interest on the Second Lien Notes accrues at the rate of 11.875% per annum, comprised of 10.375% per annum in cash and 1.500% per annum payable in kind ( PIK,\u201d and such interest PIK Interest\u201d). The cash portion of the interest on the Second Lien Notes is payable in cash and the PIK Interest on the Second Lien Notes is payable in kind, each semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, commencing on July 1, 2016. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Second Lien Notes.\nThe weighted-average interest rate as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 for our debt, excluding the Cerberus 3L Notes, was 11.2% and 10.5%, respectively, excluding the impact of deferred financing fees. There were no interest rate hedges in place during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOn June 15, 2016, DynCorp Funding LLC, a limited liability company managed by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\"Cerberus\"), entered into a Third Lien Credit Agreement (the \"Third Lien Credit Agreement\") with us. Under the Third Lien Credit Agreement, DynCorp Funding LLC has made a $30.0 million term loan to us (the \"Cerberus 3L Notes\"). The interest rate per annum applicable to the Cerberus 3L Notes is 5.00%, payable in kind on a quarterly basis. The Cerberus 3L Notes do not require any mandatory amortization payments prior to maturity and the outstanding principal amounts shall be payable on June 15, 2026.\nDebt Covenants and Other Matters\nThe New Senior Credit Facility contains a number of financial, as well as non-financial, affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are usual and customary. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability to:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur additional indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make investments, loans, guarantees or advances;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in mergers or acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends and make distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>repay certain other indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>amend our organizational documents;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change our accounting policies or reporting practices or our fiscal year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Among other things, the New Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The total leverage ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in Amendment No. 5 (which definition excludes debt under the Cerberus 3L Notes), less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (up to $75.0 million) to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in Amendment No. 5, for the applicable period. The maximum total leverage ratio was 4.75 to 1.0 for the period ended December 31, 2018. The interest coverage ratio is the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined in Amendment No. 5 (which provides that interest expense with respect to the Cerberus 3L Notes is excluded). The minimum interest coverage ratio was 1.70 to 1.0 for the period ended December 31, 2018.\nThe New Senior Credit Facility requires, solely for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolver, for us to maintain minimum liquidity (based on availability of revolving credit commitments plus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) as of the end of each fiscal quarter after December 31, 2017 of not less than $50.0 million. The credit agreement governing the New Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default.\nThe Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes contains various covenants that restrict our ability to:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur additional indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends on capital stock or repurchase capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of its assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nThe Cerberus 3L Notes include covenants consistent with the covenants set forth in the Second Lien Notes; provided that each basket\u201d or cushion\u201d set forth in the covenants is at least 25% less restrictive than the corresponding provision set forth in the Second Lien Notes.\nWe closely evaluate our expected ability to remain in compliance with our financial maintenance covenants.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for the items described in the table below. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures in the evaluation of our business and believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful measure of operational performance on a consolidated basis because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital investments and interest expense and is consistent with one of the measures we use to evaluate management's performance for incentive compensation. In addition, all adjustments to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA as presented in the table below correspond to the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the New Senior Credit Facility and/or the definition of EBITDA used in the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss) attributable to Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating operating performance and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in reviewing the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of the performance of other companies. When evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i) increasing or decreasing trends in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA compare to our debt outstanding. The non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do have certain limitations. They do not include interest expense, which is a necessary and ongoing part of our cost structure resulting from the incurrence of debt. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude tax, depreciation and amortization expenses. Because these are material and recurring items, any measure, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes them has a material limitation. To mitigate these limitations, we have policies and procedures in place to identify expenses that qualify as interest, taxes, loss on debt extinguishments and depreciation and amortization and to approve and segregate these expenses from other expenses to ensure that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are consistently reflected from period to period. Our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of other companies. Therefore, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from operations or actually available for capital investments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods included below:\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc.\nCredit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA Calculation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net income (loss) attributable to Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,064\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Provision for income tax\n</td> <td>17,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Interest expense, net of interest income\n</td> <td>61,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Depreciation and amortization(1)\n</td> <td>27,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>191,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Certain income/expense or gain/loss adjustments per our credit agreements (2)\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Employee share based compensation, severance, relocation and retention expense (3)\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Cerberus fees (4)\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Global Advisory Group expenses (5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other (6)\n</td> <td>(2,027\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes certain depreciation and amortization amounts which are classified as Cost of services in the consolidated statements of operations of Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes the $1.8 million impairment of investment in affiliates and certain costs associated with the Refinancing Transactions in calendar year 2016, as well as certain unusual income and expense items, as defined in the Indenture and New Senior Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Includes post-employment benefit expense related to severance in accordance with ASC 712 -

Bids for longer term fixed-price and time-and-materials type contracts typically include sufficient labor and other cost escalations in amounts expected to cover cost increases over the periods of performance. The majority of our contracts are cost-reimbursable type contracts, which consequently, eliminate the impact of inflation. Costs and revenue include an inflationary increase that is commensurate with the general economy in which we operate. As such, Net income (loss) attributable to Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. has not been materially impacted by inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. Significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed quarterly by management. The evaluation process includes a thorough review of key estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may materially differ from the estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in\ntheir application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management discusses our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors annually.\nRevenue Recognition and Cost Estimation on Long-Term Contracts\nOn January 1, 2018, we updated our critical accounting policies due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\"), using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The impacts related to the adoption of ASC 606 on our portfolio of contracts primarily relate to the units of account and the methods used to measure of progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation. Previously, certain of our contracts that included multiple promises related to the transfer of goods or services to the customer were combined or segmented based on profit center and the requisite revenue was recognized by profit center using the percentage-of-completion method or completed-contract method. We now evaluate all promises in an arrangement to determine if they represent one or more distinct performance obligations.\nGeneral - We are predominantly a services provider and only include products or systems when necessary for the execution of the service arrangement. As such, systems, equipment or materials are not generally separable from the services we provide. Revenue is recognized for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. Our contracts are primarily with U.S. government customers and are generally structured under the following contract types: (i) fixed-price; (ii) time-and-materials; and (iii) cost-reimbursement. In a fixed-price contract, the price is generally not subject to adjustment based on costs incurred and may include firm fixed-price, fixed-price with economic adjustment, and fixed-price incentive elements. Time-and-materials contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of direct labor hours at fixed hourly/daily rates plus materials at cost. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for payment for allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract, plus a fixed-fee, award-fee, incentive-fee or a combination thereof.\nOur contracts contain promises to provide distinct goods or services to the customer which represent performance obligations and is the unit of account under ASC 606. To determine the proper revenue recognition method, consideration is given as to whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation or whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract. For most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and deliverables into a single service solution. Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less commonly, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, the contract's transaction price is allocated based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach. In instances where a performance obligation does not have an observable standalone selling price, we select an estimation method that maximizes the use of observable inputs.\nMajor factors we consider in determining total estimated revenue and cost include the base contract price, contract options, change orders (modifications of the original contract), back charges and claims, and contract provisions for penalties, award fees and performance incentives. All of these factors and other less significant contract provisions are evaluated throughout the life of our contracts when estimating transaction price. We inherently have risks related to our estimates with long-term contracts. Actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates. We believe the following are the risks associated with our estimation process: (i) assumptions are uncertain and inherently judgmental at the time of the estimate; (ii) use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates, particularly with respect to estimates of contract revenues, costs and recoverability of assets; and (iii) changes in estimates could have material effects on our financial condition or results of operations. The impact of any one of these factors could contribute to a material cumulative adjustment.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from long-term contracts and programs with a base period and multiple option periods for services provided to the U.S. federal government. We recognize revenue over time and our contracts typically have one year base periods and multiple one year option periods. The option periods are considered separate purchase obligations from the base period. Generally, the terms and conditions of the contracts result in a continuous transfer of control over the relevant goods and services. As a result of control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use a cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the\ntotal estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor, materials and subcontractors' costs, other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. In certain instances, we may recognize revenue at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer using an output method based on units produced or delivered.\nWe consider the unfunded portions of a contract and award and incentive fees to be variable consideration. Some of our long-term contracts with the U.S. government are only partially funded at inception as a result of the U.S. government's annual budget and appropriations process. The unfunded portion of a contract is included in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that the unfunded portion of the contract will become funded. We consider the following factors in determining the likelihood that the unfunded portion of the contract would not result in a significant revenue reversal: (i) period of time before contract funding is expected; (ii) history of receiving funding in similar situations; and (iii) communication from the customer that funding will be obtained. Award and incentive fees are generally awarded upon achievement of specified performance objectives, milestones, or cost targets and are considered variable consideration. We do not consider the mere existence of potential award or incentive fees as presumptive evidence that award or incentive fees are to be included in determining total transaction price. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical award experience, and information that is reasonably available to us.\nPre-contract costs are costs incurred to fulfill a contract in anticipation of a contract award. Pre-contract costs such as those specifically chargeable to a customer and probable of recovery under a specific anticipated contract would be capitalized. All other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs, would be expensed as incurred.\nManagement regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates, including total cost to complete a project. For each project, estimates for total project costs are based on such factors as a project's contractual requirements and management's assessment of current and future pricing, economic conditions, political conditions and site conditions. Estimates can be impacted by such factors as additional requirements from our customers, a change in labor markets impacting the availability or cost of a skilled workforce, regulatory changes both domestically and internationally, political unrest or security issues at project locations. Revisions to estimates are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as changes in accounting estimates in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known by management. See aggregate changes in contract estimates in Note 1 to the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe long-term contracts, contracts in a loss position, contracts with material award or incentive fees, and contract modifications drive the significant changes in estimates in our contracts. These estimates are reviewed and assessed quarterly and could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments.\nU.S. Federal Government Contracts - For most of our U.S. federal government contracts, we provide a significant service of integrating equipment, materials, and services into a single project which is accounted for as one performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price for each distinct good or service. Where a series of distinct services has been identified, the Company generally allocates variable consideration to distinct time increments of service (e.g. hours, days, etc.). Where the variable consideration is not directly tied to the base pricing structure of the contract (e.g. cost incurrence), the Company allocates variable consideration to a subset of services within a period (e.g. evaluation periods for awards/incentives).\nRevenues are recognized over time upon contract specifications. The method utilized to measure performance progress reflects the best depiction of control to the customer. If control is transferred over time, revenue is recognized over time using the cost-to-cost-method to measure performance progress.\nOther Contracts - Contracts with non-federal government customers are predominantly service arrangements which may involve various combinations related to the provision of services, delivery of equipment and materials, grant licenses and other rights, or take certain actions. For most of our contracts, we provide a significant service of integrating equipment, materials, or other services into a single project, which is accounted for as one performance obligation. In certain instances, we also provide a stand-ready service in the case where the Company responds to the customer's needs on the basis of its demand.\nIn determining transaction price, the Company considers the unfunded portions of a contract and award and incentive fees to be variable consideration which is estimated using the best estimate of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled per the terms and conditions of the contract at inception and reassessed quarterly. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price for each distinct good or service. Where a series of distinct services has been identified, the Company generally allocates variable consideration to distinct time increments of service (e.g. hours, days, etc.). Where the variable consideration is not directly tied to the base pricing structure of the contract (e.g. cost incurrence), the Company allocates variable consideration to a subset of services within a period (e.g. evaluation periods for awards/incentives).\nRevenue is recognized over time upon contract specifications. The method utilized to measure performance progress reflects the best depiction of control to the customer. If consideration is considered fixed, revenue is recognized over time using the cost-to-cost-method to measure performance progress. If consideration is considered variable, revenue is recognized as performance occurs. In instances where the contract structure is time-and-materials, the Company may utilize the practical expedient allowing the recognition of revenue in the amount at which the Company invoices as the invoiced amounts correspond directly with the value provided to the customer and to which it is entitled to payment for performance to date.\nDeferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best estimate of future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Income tax expense is the amount of tax payable for the period net of the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nIn evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we assess the need for any related valuation allowances or adjust the amount of any allowances, if necessary. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more-likely-than-not to be realized. We assess both positive and negative evidence including the existence of a three year cumulative loss, forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the need for or sufficiency of a valuation allowance. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could also impact the need for certain valuation allowances. Due to enacted tax laws, such as the Tax Act, the Company is required to value its deferred tax assets and liabilities applying the rates prescribed by the enacted law in its valuation allowance assessment.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in potential assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate.\nUnder ASC 740 - Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.\nValuation of Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 350-20 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test each October of our calendar year. We also assess goodwill at the end of a quarter if a triggering event occurs. In determining whether an interim triggering event has occurred, management monitors (i) the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test, (ii) and significant changes to future expectations.\nWe estimate a portion of the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach by utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on several factors including balance sheet carrying values, historical results, our most recent forecasts, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative information. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital at the date of evaluation. We also use the market approach to estimate the remaining portion of our reporting unit valuation. This technique utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. While the income approach has the advantage of utilizing more company specific information, the market approach has the advantage of capturing market based transaction pricing.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. Preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts, the discount rate selected, or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charge in a future period. The annual goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment, as defined by ASC 350-20 - Intangibles - Goodwill. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by operating segment management. If upon completion of the goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will recognize an impairment loss.\nImpairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a \"relief from royalty\" method, which estimates the fair value of a trademark by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about revenue growth, an appropriate royalty rate, and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill discussed above. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the reporting unit with a goodwill balance is substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nThe recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The recoverable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing assumptions similar to those for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. An impairment loss is recognized if the asset value is not determined to be recoverable.

Amounts associated with lawsuits and claims are reserved for matters in which it is believed that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Reserves related to such matters have been recorded in \"accrued liabilities.\" When only a range of amounts is established and no amount within the range is more probable than another, the lower end of the range is recorded.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to fiscal years of the United States government pertain to their fiscal year, which ends on September 30th of each year.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading global services provider offering unique, tailored solutions for an ever-changing world. Built on approximately seven decades of experience as a trusted partner to commercial, government and military customers, we provide sophisticated aviation solutions, law enforcement training and support, base and logistics operations, intelligence training, rule of law development, construction management, international development, ground vehicle support, counter-narcotics aviation, platform services and operations and linguist services. Our current customers include the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Department of State (\"DoS\"), the U.S. Agency for International Development (\"USAID\"), foreign governments, commercial customers and certain other U.S. federal, state and local government departments and agencies.\nDelta Tucker Holdings, Inc. was formed for the purpose of acquiring DynCorp International Inc. (\"DynCorp International\") and had immaterial assets and virtually no operations prior to the merger on July 7, 2010, except for the costs associated with acquiring DynCorp International. Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. remains the holding company of DynCorp International. DynCorp International wholly owns DynCorp International LLC, which functions as the operating company.\nThe Company's organizational structure includes two operating and reporting segments: DynAviation and DynLogistics. The DynAviation and DynLogistics segments operate principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\") and audits by various U.S. federal agencies.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we employed or managed approximately 13,200 personnel, including approximately 5,700 personnel from our affiliates. We operate in approximately 30 countries through approximately 46 active contracts and 60 active task orders.\nCurrent Operating Environment and Outlook\nExternal Factors\nOur business is primarily derived from U.S. government contracts to support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives around the globe. Federal spending for these activities combined with capabilities with policy priorities, guide our ability to grow the business. The industry welcomed the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which added $165 billion in defense spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The stability and predictability provided by this budget deal created a positive business environment and spurred growth in the defense services sector.\nFor fiscal year 2019, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") was appropriated $675 billion which is a $20 billion increase over fiscal year 2018. Funding continues to be directed toward programs and activities that restore readiness and ensure the future readiness of the force, to include increased purchasing of parts, training, flight hours and other readiness enablers. Looking to fiscal year 2020, the President has indicated that the national defense request will be approximately $750 billion. If so, this request which includes DoD, as well as funding for the Department of Energy, Department of Justice and other agencies, would be the third consecutive year of compounding increases in national defense spending.\nGrowth in the defense budget combined with the prioritization of readiness and ongoing operations aligns with our core offerings and favors continued growth. Still, U.S. policy and budget decisions do not exist in a vacuum, and global events shape adjustments to policies, as well as the funding levels and mechanisms to support these shifts. External factors influencing the industry continue to include:\n \u2022 Increased competition and opportunity caused by IDIQs and other bidding trends; \n \u2022 Readiness-driven requirements to maintain and sustain equipment; \n \u2022 Budget Control Act (\"BCA\") mandated caps on defense spending; \n \u2022 Disruptions to funding caused by a government shutdown or a continuing resolution; \n \u2022 Troop levels, mission requirements and tempo of operations in Afghanistan; \n \u2022 Geopolitical environment in Iraq, Syria and the wider Middle East; \n \u2022 North Korea's nuclear program and challenging behavior; and \n \u2022 Russian aggression in Europe and the Middle East.  Legislatively, we believe the recent appropriations agreement to fund all government agencies for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 was a welcomed sign of bipartisanship. Congressional leaders have stated there is bipartisan political support to reach a new budget deal that will increase the BCA mandated caps on defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. However, timelines on when a new budget deal may be executed remain unclear and there can be no guarantees that any such deal will be achieved. If Congress is unable to reach an agreement, any funds appropriated above the existing BCA mandated caps will be subject to sequestration.\nInternationally, ongoing negotiations to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan will impact the U.S roles and missions, as well as the related force structure. To reach an agreement, the U.S. and Afghanistan governments are likely to require a NATO in-country footprint to assist with vital and necessary tasks, such as training and equipping the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces and maintaining counter-terrorism capabilities, which entails proportionate contractor support. In addition to Afghanistan, the wider geopolitical environment, even with the territorial loss of ISIS and increased dialogue on the Korean peninsula, is defined by an array of global threats and concerns that argue for continued robust Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO\") funding in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.\nWe believe the following longer-term industry trends demonstrate the continued demand for the types of services we provide:\n \u2022 Realignment of the military force structure, leading to increased outsourcing of non-combat functions, including life cycle; \n \u2022 Asset management of equipment ranging from operational, immediate and depot-level maintenance; \n \u2022 Requirement to maintain, overhaul and upgrade for returning rolling stocks and aging platforms; \n \u2022 Sustain and support forward-deployed rotational troops and equipment; and \n \u2022 Growth in outsourcing by foreign allies of maintenance, supply-support, facilities management, infrastructure upgrades, and construction management related services.  Current Business Environment\nOur contract vehicles typically have a base period with multiple option periods. The majority of these periods are for a term of one year, as the contract duration is the period over which the parties have present enforceable rights. We also have a strong history of being awarded a majority of the contract options. Furthermore, the significance of any one contract can change as our business expands or contracts. Additionally, as contract modifications, contract extensions or other contract actions occur, the profitability of any one contract can become more or less significant to the Company. As contracts are re-competed, there is the potential for the size, contract type, contract structure or other contract elements to materially change from the original contract resulting in significant changes to the scope, scale, profitability or magnitude of accounts receivable of the new re-competed contract as compared to the original contract. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes to our contracts could impact our future profitability.\u201d\nSince our primary customer is the U.S. federal government, we have not historically had significant issues with bad debt. However, given the continued scrutiny by the U.S. government, we could be subjected to regulatory requirements that could require audits at various points within our contracting process. An adverse finding under an audit could result in the disallowance of costs under a U.S. government contract, termination of a U.S. government contract, forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments, which could prove to be impactful to our liquidity, affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on our contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. Disapproval of our control systems could result in an adverse outcome.\nWe cannot be certain that the economic environment or other factors will not continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. We believe that our primary sources of liquidity, such as customer collections and the New Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), will enable us to continue to perform under our existing contracts and support further growth of our business. However, adverse conditions, such as a long term credit crisis or sequestration, could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional liquidity or refinance existing indebtedness at acceptable terms or at all. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Economic conditions could impact our business\" for a discussion of the risks associated with current economic conditions.\nNotable events for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to date\n \u2022 In January 2018, the Company changed its three operating and reportable segments, DynLogistics, AELS and AOLC, to two operating and reportable segments: DynLogistics and DynAviation. \n \u2022 In February 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract extension from the United States Army Contracting Command to provide advisory, training and mentoring services to the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense.

Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016:\n\nResults of Operations 2018 vs 2017\nRevenue - Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,148.3 million, an increase of $143.8 million or 7.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV program and the performance of the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support, Contractor Logistics Support: C-12, C-26, UC-35 and T-6 Transport (\"CLS Transport\") and Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volume on and the completion of the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (\"INL Air Wing\") extension, the completion of the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contracts, and the completion of certain other contracts. See further discussion of our revenue results in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nCost of services - Cost of services are comprised of direct labor, direct material, overhead, subcontractors, travel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,860.8 million, an increase of $99.3 million, or 5.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cost of services was primarily driven by the increase in revenue, as discussed above. As a percentage of revenue, Cost of services improved to 86.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 87.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a reduction to our inventory reserve resulting from the sale of inventory from our T-6 COMBS contract. See further discussion of the impact of program margins in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - SG&A primarily relates to functions such as management, legal, financial accounting, contracts and administration, human resources, management information systems, purchasing and business\ndevelopment. SG&A decreased by $10.1 million, or 9.4%, to $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a reduction in consulting costs and our cost reduction initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the decrease in SG&A and increase in revenue discussed above.\nDepreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.1 million, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of our DoS customer-related intangible assets during calendar year 2017.\nEarnings from equity method investees - Earnings from equity method investees include our proportionate share of the income of our equity method investees deemed to be operationally integral to our business, such as Partnership for Temporary Housing LLC (\"PaTH\") and Global Linguist Solutions (\"GLS\"). Earnings from operationally integral unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of activity in our PaTH joint venture.\nInterest expense - Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $64.0 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 9.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in debt due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on the Term Loan, the redemption of the $39.3 million principal balance of the 10.375% Senior Notes due 2017 (the \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") in 2017 and a reduction in issued letters of credit partially offset by the PIK interest on our Second Lien Notes.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt - Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on March 21, 2018 and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on October 19, 2018 on the Term Loan. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was an immaterial amount during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $25.1 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on the Term Loan on April 4, 2017. Deferred financing costs associated with the additional prepayments were expensed and recorded to Loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest income - Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to more favorable interest rates combined with our higher cash position during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income, net - Other income, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net consists primarily of sublease income and asset sales.\nProvision for income taxes - Our effective tax rate consists of federal and state statutory rates, certain permanent differences and discrete items. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we reported a tax provision of $17.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 17.1%, as compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the federal and state tax rates applied to taxable income offset by a reduction to deferred tax assets that are subject to the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the tax reform legislation known colloquially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) and its impact on the carrying value of the valuation allowance the Company had previously recorded against its deferred tax assets. The most significant impacts of the Tax Act are a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a reduction of our deductible interest expense, the prevention of revenue deferral on unbilled receivables as well as the requirement to recognize previously deferred revenue over a four-year period under Internal Revenue Code Section 481 and to value our deferred tax assets and liabilities applying the Tax Act rates for the period in which such deferred taxes assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. See Note 5 to the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of income taxes.\nResults of Operations 2017 vs 2016\nRevenue - Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2,004.4 million, an increase of $168.3 million or 9.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to fiscal years of the United States government pertain to their fiscal year, which ends on September 30th of each year.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading global services provider offering unique, tailored solutions for an ever-changing world. Built on approximately seven decades of experience as a trusted partner to commercial, government and military customers, we provide sophisticated aviation solutions, law enforcement training and support, base and logistics operations, intelligence training, rule of law development, construction management, international development, ground vehicle support, counter-narcotics aviation, platform services and operations and linguist services. Our current customers include the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Department of State (\"DoS\"), the U.S. Agency for International Development (\"USAID\"), foreign governments, commercial customers and certain other U.S. federal, state and local government departments and agencies.\nDelta Tucker Holdings, Inc. was formed for the purpose of acquiring DynCorp International Inc. (\"DynCorp International\") and had immaterial assets and virtually no operations prior to the merger on July 7, 2010, except for the costs associated with acquiring DynCorp International. Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. remains the holding company of DynCorp International. DynCorp International wholly owns DynCorp International LLC, which functions as the operating company.\nThe Company's organizational structure includes two operating and reporting segments: DynAviation and DynLogistics. The DynAviation and DynLogistics segments operate principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\") and audits by various U.S. federal agencies.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we employed or managed approximately 13,200 personnel, including approximately 5,700 personnel from our affiliates. We operate in approximately 30 countries through approximately 46 active contracts and 60 active task orders.\nCurrent Operating Environment and Outlook\nExternal Factors\nOur business is primarily derived from U.S. government contracts to support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives around the globe. Federal spending for these activities combined with capabilities with policy priorities, guide our ability to grow the business. The industry welcomed the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which added $165 billion in defense spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The stability and predictability provided by this budget deal created a positive business environment and spurred growth in the defense services sector.\nFor fiscal year 2019, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") was appropriated $675 billion which is a $20 billion increase over fiscal year 2018. Funding continues to be directed toward programs and activities that restore readiness and ensure the future readiness of the force, to include increased purchasing of parts, training, flight hours and other readiness enablers. Looking to fiscal year 2020, the President has indicated that the national defense request will be approximately $750 billion. If so, this request which includes DoD, as well as funding for the Department of Energy, Department of Justice and other agencies, would be the third consecutive year of compounding increases in national defense spending.\nGrowth in the defense budget combined with the prioritization of readiness and ongoing operations aligns with our core offerings and favors continued growth. Still, U.S. policy and budget decisions do not exist in a vacuum, and global events shape adjustments to policies, as well as the funding levels and mechanisms to support these shifts. External factors influencing the industry continue to include:\n \u2022 Increased competition and opportunity caused by IDIQs and other bidding trends; \n \u2022 Readiness-driven requirements to maintain and sustain equipment; \n \u2022 Budget Control Act (\"BCA\") mandated caps on defense spending; \n \u2022 Disruptions to funding caused by a government shutdown or a continuing resolution; \n \u2022 Troop levels, mission requirements and tempo of operations in Afghanistan; \n \u2022 Geopolitical environment in Iraq, Syria and the wider Middle East; \n \u2022 North Korea's nuclear program and challenging behavior; and \n \u2022 Russian aggression in Europe and the Middle East.  Legislatively, we believe the recent appropriations agreement to fund all government agencies for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 was a welcomed sign of bipartisanship. Congressional leaders have stated there is bipartisan political support to reach a new budget deal that will increase the BCA mandated caps on defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. However, timelines on when a new budget deal may be executed remain unclear and there can be no guarantees that any such deal will be achieved. If Congress is unable to reach an agreement, any funds appropriated above the existing BCA mandated caps will be subject to sequestration.\nInternationally, ongoing negotiations to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan will impact the U.S roles and missions, as well as the related force structure. To reach an agreement, the U.S. and Afghanistan governments are likely to require a NATO in-country footprint to assist with vital and necessary tasks, such as training and equipping the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces and maintaining counter-terrorism capabilities, which entails proportionate contractor support. In addition to Afghanistan, the wider geopolitical environment, even with the territorial loss of ISIS and increased dialogue on the Korean peninsula, is defined by an array of global threats and concerns that argue for continued robust Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO\") funding in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.\nWe believe the following longer-term industry trends demonstrate the continued demand for the types of services we provide:\n \u2022 Realignment of the military force structure, leading to increased outsourcing of non-combat functions, including life cycle; \n \u2022 Asset management of equipment ranging from operational, immediate and depot-level maintenance; \n \u2022 Requirement to maintain, overhaul and upgrade for returning rolling stocks and aging platforms; \n \u2022 Sustain and support forward-deployed rotational troops and equipment; and \n \u2022 Growth in outsourcing by foreign allies of maintenance, supply-support, facilities management, infrastructure upgrades, and construction management related services.  Current Business Environment\nOur contract vehicles typically have a base period with multiple option periods. The majority of these periods are for a term of one year, as the contract duration is the period over which the parties have present enforceable rights. We also have a strong history of being awarded a majority of the contract options. Furthermore, the significance of any one contract can change as our business expands or contracts. Additionally, as contract modifications, contract extensions or other contract actions occur, the profitability of any one contract can become more or less significant to the Company. As contracts are re-competed, there is the potential for the size, contract type, contract structure or other contract elements to materially change from the original contract resulting in significant changes to the scope, scale, profitability or magnitude of accounts receivable of the new re-competed contract as compared to the original contract. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes to our contracts could impact our future profitability.\u201d\nSince our primary customer is the U.S. federal government, we have not historically had significant issues with bad debt. However, given the continued scrutiny by the U.S. government, we could be subjected to regulatory requirements that could require audits at various points within our contracting process. An adverse finding under an audit could result in the disallowance of costs under a U.S. government contract, termination of a U.S. government contract, forfeiture of profits or suspension of payments, which could prove to be impactful to our liquidity, affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on our contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. Disapproval of our control systems could result in an adverse outcome.\nWe cannot be certain that the economic environment or other factors will not continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. We believe that our primary sources of liquidity, such as customer collections and the New Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), will enable us to continue to perform under our existing contracts and support further growth of our business. However, adverse conditions, such as a long term credit crisis or sequestration, could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional liquidity or refinance existing indebtedness at acceptable terms or at all. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Economic conditions could impact our business\" for a discussion of the risks associated with current economic conditions.\nNotable events for the year ended December 31, 2018 and to date\n \u2022 In January 2018, the Company changed its three operating and reportable segments, DynLogistics, AELS and AOLC, to two operating and reportable segments: DynLogistics and DynAviation. \n \u2022 In February 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract extension from the United States Army Contracting Command to provide advisory, training and mentoring services to the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense.

December 31, 2018 was $2,148.3 million, an increase of $143.8 million or 7.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV program and the performance of the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support, Contractor Logistics Support: C-12, C-26, UC-35 and T-6 Transport (\"CLS Transport\") and Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volume on and the completion of the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (\"INL Air Wing\") extension, the completion of the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contracts, and the completion of certain other contracts. See further discussion of our revenue results in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nCost of services - Cost of services are comprised of direct labor, direct material, overhead, subcontractors, travel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,860.8 million, an increase of $99.3 million, or 5.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Cost of services was primarily driven by the increase in revenue, as discussed above. As a percentage of revenue, Cost of services improved to 86.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 87.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a reduction to our inventory reserve resulting from the sale of inventory from our T-6 COMBS contract. See further discussion of the impact of program margins in the \"Results by Segment\" section below.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - SG&A primarily relates to functions such as management, legal, financial accounting, contracts and administration, human resources, management information systems, purchasing and business\ndevelopment. SG&A decreased by $10.1 million, or 9.4%, to $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a reduction in consulting costs and our cost reduction initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the decrease in SG&A and increase in revenue discussed above.\nDepreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.1 million, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of our DoS customer-related intangible assets during calendar year 2017.\nEarnings from equity method investees - Earnings from equity method investees include our proportionate share of the income of our equity method investees deemed to be operationally integral to our business, such as Partnership for Temporary Housing LLC (\"PaTH\") and Global Linguist Solutions (\"GLS\"). Earnings from operationally integral unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of activity in our PaTH joint venture.\nInterest expense - Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $64.0 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 9.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in debt due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on the Term Loan, the redemption of the $39.3 million principal balance of the 10.375% Senior Notes due 2017 (the \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") in 2017 and a reduction in issued letters of credit partially offset by the PIK interest on our Second Lien Notes.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt - Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on March 21, 2018 and the $50.0 million voluntary principal payment made on October 19, 2018 on the Term Loan. Loss on early extinguishment of debt was an immaterial amount during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $25.1 million Excess Cash Flow principal payment made on the Term Loan on April 4, 2017. Deferred financing costs associated with the additional prepayments were expensed and recorded to Loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest income - Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to more favorable interest rates combined with our higher cash position during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income, net - Other income, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net consists primarily of sublease income and asset sales.\nProvision for income taxes - Our effective tax rate consists of federal and state statutory rates, certain permanent differences and discrete items. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we reported a tax provision of $17.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 17.1%, as compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the federal and state tax rates applied to taxable income offset by a reduction to deferred tax assets that are subject to the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the tax reform legislation known colloquially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) and its impact on the carrying value of the valuation allowance the Company had previously recorded against its deferred tax assets. The most significant impacts of the Tax Act are a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a reduction of our deductible interest expense, the prevention of revenue deferral on unbilled receivables as well as the requirement to recognize previously deferred revenue over a four-year period under Internal Revenue Code Section 481 and to value our deferred tax assets and liabilities applying the Tax Act rates for the period in which such deferred taxes assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
