sustainability, Landsea Homes Corporation (\"LHC\") designs and builds homes and communities in Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and the Metro New York area. We create inspired spaces for modern living and feature homes and communities in vibrant, prime locations which connect seamlessly with their surroundings and enhance the local lifestyle for living, working, and playing. The defining principle, Live in Your Element\u00ae,\u201d creates the foundation for our customers to live where they want to live, how they want to live - in a home created especially for them.\nThe Company's operations are engaged in the acquisition, development, and sale of homes and lots in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. The Company's operations are organized into five reportable segments: Arizona, California, Florida, Metro New York, and Texas. The Company builds and sells an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points but focus our efforts on the first-time homebuyer. Our Corporate operations are a non-operating segment to support our homebuilding operations by providing executive, finance, treasury, human resources, accounting and legal services.\nOn January 18, 2022, we acquired 100% of Hanover Family Builders, LLC (\"Hanover\"), a Florida-based homebuilder for an aggregate cash purchase price of $179.2 million. The Hanover acquisition increases our presence in Florida with backlog of approximately 520 units valued at approximately $228 million as of the acquisition date.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions across the United States began to impact our business at the end of the first quarter of 2020. This impacted our construction phases and our ability to complete the legal and regulatory steps to close homes. As restrictions related to COVID-19 eased, our ability to progress with home construction and related deliveries improved significantly during the remainder of 2020 and remained strong throughout 2021. With the lifting of restrictions we also saw significant increases in demand across our markets. We believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and a general tightening supply of homes for sale. These macroeconomic effects have allowed us to increase prices and derive additional revenue from our home deliveries; however we frequently see those increased revenues partially offset by higher costs associated with labor and supply shortages. In certain markets we have seen our construction cycle lengthen primarily due to supply chain constraints and in those markets we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production level. Based on the current availability of labor and materials, the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory, and production schedules, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in some of our communities in the near term.\nStrategy\nThe Company's strategy is focused on maximizing shareholder returns through profitability and efficiency, while balancing appropriate amounts of leverage. In general, we are focused on the following long-term strategic objectives:\n\u2022Expand community count in current markets and enhance operating returns\n\u2022Maintain an appropriate supply of lots\n\u2022Continue to focus on entry-level product offerings\n\u2022Strengthen unique brand position through product differentiation\n\u2022Continue geographic expansion and diversification into new markets\n\u2022Leverage existing SG&A base to enhance stockholder returns and profitability\n\u2022Become a top-ten homebuilder in the United States\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures of a company's performance that exclude or include amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The presentation of non-GAAP\n- 51 -\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe present non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted home sales gross margin, net debt to net capital, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income in their respective sections below to enhance an investor's evaluation of the ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of the results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting.\nResults of Operations\nDuring 2021, we continued our strategy of shifting our inventory and product to more affordable price points. In May 2021, we completed our homebuilder acquisition in the Florida and Texas markets by purchasing 100% of the membership interests of Vintage Estate Homes (\"Vintage\"). This acquisition expanded our business into Florida and Texas with an inventory of approximately 1,800 lots, in various stage of development. The combination of our investments in the Florida and Texas markets and strong activity in the existing California and Arizona markets during 2021 resulted in a 27% year-over-year increase in home sales revenue and a 7% increase in homes delivered from 1,527 units in 2020 to 1,640 units in 2021. The larger increase in home sales revenue as compared to home deliveries reflects the increasing price appreciation in each of our markets along with the strong performance of our California market which typically has a higher average selling price (\"ASP\") than the other markets we operate in.\nWe remain focused on growth and view our leverageaccess to capital markets and the generation of free cash flow form operations as a key factor in allowing us to expand. Even as the Company has grown organically and through business acquisitions in recent years, we remain in a position to act on our strategy and to be opportunistic about acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Our debt to capital ratio increased to 42.6% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 33.3% as of December 31, 2020, and our cash and cash equivalents increased to $342.8 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $105.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We believe the combination of cash and modest leverage levels of our balance sheet position us well to continue to execute our growth strategy.\nWe anticipate the homebuilding markets in each of our operating segments to be tied to both the local economy and the macroeconomic environment. Accordingly, net orders, home deliveries, and ASPs in future years could be negatively affected by economic conditions, such as decreases in employment and median household incomes, as well as decreases in household formations and increasing supply of inventories. Shortages in labor or materials could also significantly increase costs, reduce gross margins, and lower our overall profitability. During 2021 we experienced increases in our production cycle times due to labor and material shortages that have caused us to reduce our absorption rate in certain markets, primarily in our Arizona segment. Additionally, the results could be impacted by a decrease in home affordability as a result of price appreciation, increases in mortgage interest rates, or tightening of mortgage lending standards.\n- 52 -\nNet New Home Orders, Dollar Value of Orders, and Monthly Absorption Rates\nChanges in the dollar value of net new orders are impacted by changes in the number of net new orders and the average selling price of those homes. Monthly Absorption Rate is calculated as total net new orders per period, divided by the average active communities during the period, divided by the number of months per period.\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arizona </td> <td>685 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,474 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,283 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,338 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td>631 </td> <td> </td> <td>563,922 </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td>566,078 </td> <td> </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida (1)\n</td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td>65,046 </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metro New York </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td>50,687 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas (1)(2)\n</td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td>(692) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>1,471 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>963,437 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,891 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>968,416 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(27) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Monthly Absorption Rate for Florida and Texas in 2021 is based on eight months for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes in May 2021.\n(2) The ASP calculation for our Texas segment is not a meaningful disclosure as presented above due to cancellations and renegotiation of contract terms during the period presented.

We are experiencing constraints in our production processes due to labor and material shortages for homes currently under construction and that has extended our production cycle. We expect such delays are likely to continue in the short-term. The year-over-year change in dollar value of net new home orders in Arizona is less impacted due to a 32% increase in ASP during the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, the increase in net new orders in California was primarily due to a slight increase in the monthly absorption rate, which was driven by entry-level communities with a lower ASP that sold at a much faster pace.\nOur new Florida segment, beginning from the acquisition of Vintage, has provided steady orders with a slightly increasing ASP over the year, beginning in May 2021. We continue to purchase more lots in Florida to support and\n- 53 -\ngrow our operations there and our acquisition of Hanover on January 18, 2022 significantly adds to our Florida segment.\nThe Metro New York segment has not yet delivered any homes, other than those through unconsolidated joint ventures. The units within this segment remain in various stages of construction and opened for sale in 2021. The total increase in ASP for net orders is largely due to the high dollar value of the units in our Metro New York segment.\nOur Texas segment had eight net cancellations due to pre-acquisition sales contracts that did not reflect current costs. Throughout the year, pre-acquisition contracts continued to be renegotiated or cancelled and the associated homes resold, increasing the sales dollar value of new sales and the ASP of homes in backlog.\nAverage Selling Communities\nAverage selling communities is the sum of communities actively selling each month, divided by the total months in the calculation period.\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arizona (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(33) </td> <td>% </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>230 </td> <td>% </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metro New York </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td>% </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Average selling communities calculations for Florida and Texas in 2021 are based on eight months, for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage in May 2021.

The decrease in home closings and home sales revenue compared to the same periods in 2020 was primarily attributable to production delays partially offset by an increase in ASP of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes delivered in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the year-over-year increase in home sales revenue and deliveries in the California segment of 34% and 46%, respectively, was the result of strengthening market conditions, including strong demand and rising prices in the current period. The decrease in ASP was the result of a change in mix of homes delivered during the period, which included more homes with a lower price point compared to the same period in 2020. The comparison also benefits from the 2020 deliveries being lower due to more restrictive COVID related requirements in parts of California that we operate in. However, comparing to 2019, the segment has shown strong growth during the past two years in both home sales revenue and deliveries as we strategically shift to building homes with a more attainable price point.\nAs noted above, Florida operations began in May 2021 with the acquisition of Vintage. The segment has provided steady home sales revenue and deliveries over the year with a slightly increasing ASP over the year. We continue to purchase more lots in Florida to support the growth opportunities we see there.\nThe Metro New York segment has not yet delivered any homes, other than those through unconsolidated joint ventures. Therefore, there are no consolidated home sale revenues or deliveries for the years presented.\n- 55 -\nAs noted above, Texas operations began in May 2021 with the acquisition of Vintage. The homes sales revenue, deliveries, and ASP have grown over the year as we have begun to deliver more homes after renegotiating the associated contracts obtained at acquisition.\nHome Sales Gross Margins\nHome sales gross margin measures the price achieved on delivered homes compared to the costs needed to build the home. In the following table, we calculate gross margins adjusting for interest in cost of sales, inventory impairments (if applicable), and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory (if applicable). We believe the below information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness, impairments, and acquisitions have on our gross margins and allows for comparability to previous periods and competitors.

An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful because it provides insight into the impact that financing arrangements and acquisitions have on our homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our gross margins to competitors that present similar information.\nHome sales gross margin increased from 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to home sales price appreciation amid high product demand in our Arizona and California segments, partially offset by increasing material and labor costs. Additionally, an impairment charge of $3.4 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory is a result of the recent business combinations.\nAdjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, inventory impairments, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory increased from 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to home sales price appreciation. The change also reflects a decrease in interest costs due to lowering interest rates over recent years, partially offset by increasing material and labor costs.\n- 56 -\nBacklog\nBacklog reflects the number of homes, net of cancellations, for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but have not yet delivered the home.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td> </td> <td>ASP </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td> </td> <td>ASP </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td> </td> <td>ASP </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arizona </td> <td>422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td>256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida (1)\n</td> <td>283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metro New York </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas (2)\n</td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>586,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>389,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Backlog acquired in Florida at the date of the Vintage acquisition was 377 homes with a value of $138,483 thousand.\n(2) Backlog acquired in Texas at the date of the Vintage acquisition was 40 homes with a value of $31,318 thousand.\nThe increase in the number of backlog homes and the backlog value as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to a greater number of home sales in the Florida and Texas segments following the acquisition of Vintage as well as the new sales in Metro New York at a significantly higher price point than the rest of our segments.\nSubsequent to year-end, our backlog increased by approximately 520 homes valued at approximately $228 million as a result of the Hanover acquisition on January 18, 2022.\nLot Sales and Other Revenue\nLot sales and other revenue and gross margin can vary significantly between reporting periods based on the number of lots under contract and the percentage of completion related to the development activities required as part of the lot sales and other contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, we recognized $86.9 million and $62.1 million in lot sales and other revenue, respectively. We did not have any lot sales or other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $4.0 million deferred revenue from lot sales and other revenue. The Company recognizes these amounts as development progresses and the related performance obligations are completed. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had contract assets of $6.1 million from lot sales and other contracts. The contract asset balance represents cash to be received for work already performed on lot sale and other contracts. The amount of the transaction price for lot sales and other contracts allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of December 31, 2021 was $63.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no deferred revenue or contract assets. There was no outstanding amount related to unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2020.\n- 57 -\nLots Owned or Controlled\nThe table below summarizes lots owned or controlled by reportable segment as of the dates presented.

December 31, 2020. The increase in pretax income in 2021 is primarily due to an increase in gross margins stemming from high demand which has allowed us to increase pricing.\nOur California segment recorded pretax income of $61.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $10.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was partially due to increasing demand in the current periods. This allowed us to increase pricing, which resulted in an increase in gross margins,\n- 58 -\neven with a shift in product mix that lowered our overall ASP in California. The California segment results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions and delays. Additionally, the California segment recorded real estate inventory impairments of $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Total assets in California decreased slightly as we reduce our concentration within and dependence upon the California market.\nAs noted above, Florida operations began in May 2021 with the acquisition of Vintage. The segment has operated near breakeven as we have integrated the new acquisition to align with our business model and operations. We have seen steady home sales revenue and deliveries over the year with a slightly increasing ASP over the year. We continue to purchase more lots in Florida to support the growth opportunities we see there.\nThe Metro New York segment experienced a decrease in pretax loss during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same prior periods, due to smaller losses from the unconsolidated joint venture at the LS-NJ Port Imperial JV LLC (\"Avora\") project. This was primarily due to strengthening market conditions in the current periods while the prior periods were impacted by COVID-19 related delays and pricing pressure. Avora recorded an impairment charge of $27.1 million resulting in a $13.8 million loss on unconsolidated joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs noted above, Texas operations began in May 2021 with the acquisition of Vintage. The segment has operated near breakeven as we have integrated the new acquisition to align with our business model and operations. The homes sales revenue, deliveries, and ASP have grown over the year as we have begun to deliver more homes after renegotiating the associated contracts obtained at acquisition.\nWe have also identified our Corporate operations as a non-operating segment, as it serves to support the business's operations through functional departments such as executive, finance, treasury, human resources, accounting and legal. The majority of the corporate personnel and resources are primarily dedicated to activities relating to the business's operations and are allocated accordingly. During the year ended December 31, 2021, costs allocated to our Corporate non-operating segment increased significantly as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This included transaction costs related to the Merger, costs associated with the Vintage acquisition and other potential acquisitions, as well as other increased costs associated with being a publicly traded company.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>As a Percentage of Home Sales Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>70,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2021, the selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense rate, as a percentage of home sales revenue, was 13.1%, up from 12.3% during 2020. This total increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue. This was a result of home prices rising faster than commissions due to an increase in sales that did not rely on a broker. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (1) costs related to the acquisition of Vintage as well as potential future acquisitions, (2) costs associated with the Merger and continuing operations as a public company, and (3) an increase in compensation and personnel related expenses, including stock compensation expense, to support the growth and operations of the business as a public company.\n- 59 -\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we held membership interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures related to homebuilding activities, both of which are part of the Metro New York segment. As of December 31, 2021, one of the joint ventures, LS-NJ Port Imperial JV LLC (\"Avora\"), had active homebuilding activities with orders and deliveries, while the other, LS-Boston-Point LLC (\"Boston Point\"), was effectively closed out with only customary post-closing, warranty-related activities remaining.\nOur share of joint venture income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.3 million, compared to a loss of $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and loss of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The income recognized was primarily the result of the significant number of homes delivered during the year. The Company's joint venture loss in 2020 and 2019 was due to impairment charges of $27.1 million and $5.8 million taken by the Avora joint venture in June 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on the Company's ownership percentage of 51%, $13.8 million and $3.0 million of the impairment charges were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The impairment charge in 2020 was primarily a result of slowing orders arising from restrictions and delays due to COVID-19. In both 2020 and 2019, the impairment charges were also due to increased competition from neighboring communities and weaker pricing than expected. As of December 31, 2021, the building held by the Avora joint venture is substantially closed out with only three homes remaining to sell and deliver.\nThe following sets forth supplemental operational and financial information about the unconsolidated joint ventures. Such information is not included directly in the financial statements, but is reflected in the results as a component of equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. This data is included for informational purposes only.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Operational Data </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net new home orders </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New homes delivered </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling communities at end of period </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog (dollar value) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,772 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog (homes) </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units owned and controlled </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income (Expense), net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, other income, net was $3.9 million compared to other income, net of $0.1 million for the same period in 2020. The amount of other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the $4.3 million gain on our Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") loan forgiveness partially offset by other expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes is primarily influenced by (1) changes in the amount of pretax income (loss), (2) changes in the amount of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests that are included in pretax income (loss), (3) the reversal of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, (4) income tax credits, or (5) changes in federal and state statutory income tax rates. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.0 million, as compared to a benefit of $3.1 million and a provision of $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 21.0%, and was different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefits, offset by the energy efficient home credit. The federal energy efficient home credit provides eligible contractors a federal income tax credit of $2,000 for each home delivered that meets the energy saving and certification requirements under the statute. At the end of 2021, we concluded that 1,620 homes delivered during the year were eligible for the tax credit, providing a benefit of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n- 60 -\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 25.3%, and was different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefits and prior year true-ups, partially offset by the energy efficient home credit. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 21.6%, and was different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefits, partially offset by the energy efficient home credit.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements might be impacted if we used different assumptions or conditions. The significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements. The following are accounting policies that we believe are critical because of the significance of the activity to which they relate or because they require the use of significant estimates, judgments, and/or other assumptions in their application. Management believes that the following accounting policies are among the most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nReal Estate Inventories\nReal estate inventories include actively selling projects as well as projects under development or held for future development. Inventories are stated at cost, unless the carrying amount is determined not to be recoverable, in which case inventory is written down to its fair value. The Company capitalizes pre-acquisition costs, land deposits, land, development, and other allocated costs, including interest, property taxes, and indirect construction costs to real estate inventories. Pre-acquisition costs, including non-refundable land deposits, are removed from inventory and expensed to other (expense) income, net, if the Company determines continuation of the prospective project is not probable. Land, development, and other common costs are typically allocated to real estate inventories using a methodology that approximates the relative-sales-value method. If the relative-sales-value-method is impracticable, costs are allocated based on area methods, such as square footage or lot size, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances. Home construction costs per production phase are recorded using the specific identification method.\nThe Company reviews real estate inventories on a periodic basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist. If there are indicators of impairment, the Company performs a detailed budget and cash flow review of the applicable real estate inventories to determine whether the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the project are more or less than the asset's carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are more than the asset's carrying value, no impairment adjustment is required. However, if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the asset is written down to fair value and impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales. We generally determine the estimated fair value of each community by using a discounted cash flow approach based on the estimated future cash flows at discount rates that reflect the risk of the community being evaluated.\nWhen estimating future cash flows of a project, the Company makes various assumptions including, estimated future housing revenues, sales absorption rates, land development, construction and related carrying costs, and direct selling and marketing costs. The discounted cash flow approach can be impacted significantly by our estimates of future cash flows and the applicable discount rate, which are Level 3 inputs. The key assumptions used in inventory valuation are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and market conditions. Due to uncertainties in the estimate process, the volatility in market conditions, the long life cycle of many communities, and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities, actual results could differ significantly from valuation estimates.\n- 61 -\nLot Sales and Other Revenue\nRevenues from lot sales and other revenue are recorded and a profit is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, which includes transferring a promised good or service to a customer. Lot sales and other revenue is recognized when all conditions of escrow are met, including delivery of the real estate asset in the agreed-upon condition, passage of title, receipt of appropriate consideration, and collection of associated receivables, if any, is probable, and other applicable criteria are met. Based upon the terms of the agreement, when it is determined that the performance obligation is not satisfied, the sale and the related profit are deferred for recognition in future periods.\nUnder the terms of certain lot sale and other contracts, the Company is obligated to perform certain development activities after the close of escrow. Due to this continuing involvement, the Company recognizes lot sales and other revenue under the percentage-of-completion method, whereby revenue is recognized in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred.\nThe key assumptions relating to percentage-of-completion are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. Although our assumptions reflect management's best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nWarranty Accrual\nWe provide home purchasers with limited warranties against certain building defects and we have certain obligations related to those post-construction warranties for closed homes. The specific terms and conditions of these limited warranties vary depending upon the markets in which we do business, but generally we provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment and also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity.\nEstimated future direct warranty costs are accrued and charged to cost of sales in the period when the related homebuilding revenues are recognized. Amounts are accrued based upon the Company's historical rates of warranty claims. Historical experience of the Company's peers is also considered due to the limited internal history of homebuilding sales. The adequacy of the warranty accrual is assessed on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in trends as information becomes available and the amounts recorded are adjusted if necessary. The warranty accrual is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and adjustments to are recorded through cost of sales.\nWhile we believe that our current warranty reserves are adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual for the year ended December 31, 2021 would not result in a material change in our accrual.\nWarrant Liability\nWe account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant's specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 480, and ASC 815. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance or assumption and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date thereafter.\nOur outstanding Private Placement Warrants are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each reporting date as a gain (loss) on remeasurement of the warrant liability. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which includes assumptions used in the model that are subjective and require significant judgment, including implied volatility. The implied volatility is derived from the traded price of the Company's outstanding public warrants. Changes in the assumption of implied volatility\n- 62 -\ncan materially affect the estimate of the fair value of these instruments and ultimately change the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants.\nGoodwill\nThe excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is capitalized as goodwill. Goodwill and any other intangible assets that do not have finite lives are not amortized, but rather assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company performs an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter or whenever impairment indicators are present using a two-step process to assess whether or not goodwill should be impaired. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. The first step is a qualitative assessment that analyzes current economic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates a stable or improved fair value, no further testing is required. If a qualitative assessment indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or, at our election, we will proceed to the second step where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts; estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, including terminal multiples; and the determination of the respective weighted-average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of estimated fair value and impairment for each reporting unit. If this step indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.\u201d In connection with the recent acquisitions of Vintage Estate Homes (\"Vintage\"), Garrett Walker Homes (\"Garrett Walker\"), and Pinnacle West Homes Holding Corp. (\"Pinnacle West\"), management determined in each case that the Company obtained control of a business including inputs, processes, and outputs in exchange for cash consideration. All material assets and liabilities were measured and recognized at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe fair value of acquired inventories largely depends on the stage of production of the acquired land and work in process inventory. With the assistance of a third-party appraiser, the fair value of land and land options is generally determined based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject sites to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. With the assistance of a third-party appraiser, the fair value of work in process inventories is determined based upon the stage of production of each unit and a gross margin that we believe a market participant would require to complete the remaining development and requisite selling efforts.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain. Due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors, we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful to an investor.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $343.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, a $233.2 million increase from December 31, 2020, primarily due to proceeds from the Merger of $64.4 million and net borrowings of debt, including via the new line of credit, of $172.8 million. Our payment for the acquisition of Vintage of $44.5\n- 63 -\nmillion, as well as other land purchases and construction costs, were generally offset by operating cash flows and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures.\nOur principal sources of capital are cash generated from home and land sales activities, borrowing from credit facilities, and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. Our principal uses of capital are land purchases, land development, home construction, repayments on credit facilities, the acquisition of other homebuilders, and the payment of routine liabilities.\nCash flows for each community depend on the community's stage in the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, entitlements and other approvals, and construction of model homes, roads, utilities, general landscaping, and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of inventory and not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognizing earnings. In the later stages of community development, cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes, as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred. From a liquidity standpoint, we are actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to maintain and grow our supply of lots and active selling communities.\nWe expect to generate cash from the sale of inventory including homes under construction. We generally intend to re-deploy the cash generated from the sale of inventory to acquire and develop strategic, well-positioned lots that represent opportunities to generate future income and cash flows by allocating capital to best position us for long-term success. When it meets with our strategic goals we may continue to purchase companies that strengthen our position in markets in a way that would not be possible with organic growth. As we continue to expand our business, we expect that our cash outlays for land purchases and development to increase our lot inventory may, at times, exceed our cash generated by operations.\nWe intend to utilize debt as part of our ongoing financial strategy, coupled with redeployment of cash flows from operations, to finance our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings of $472.9 million in aggregate principal, excluding deferred loan costs. We will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our business as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. In addition, our credit facilities contain certain financial covenants, among others, that limit the amount of leverage we can maintain, as well as minimum tangible net worth and liquidity requirements.\nWe believe that we will be able to fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs with our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and cash expected to be available from credit facilities or through accessing debt or equity capital as needed.\nSubsequent to year-end, we used $248.5 million to acquire Hanover and paydown related debt on January 18, 2022.\nCredit Facilities\nOn October 6, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured borrowing of up to $585.0 million of which there was $390.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The Company may increase the borrowing amount up to $850 million under certain circumstances. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% or Prime Rate plus 2.75%. The interest rate includes a floor of 3.75%. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate on the loan was 3.75%. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2024. Concurrently with the entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company paid off the previous lines of credit and all but one of its construction loans. The remaining construction loan has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.50% with a floor of 8.25%. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate on the loan was 8.25%. The construction loan matures in September 2022. Both of our loans include terms to\n- 64 -\nreplace LIBOR upon its ultimate sunset with either Ameribor for the Credit Agreement or the Prime Rate on the remaining construction loan.\nOn April 15, 2020, Landsea Holdings entered into a Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) Note evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $4.3 million made to the Company under the PPP. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Association. The proceeds from the PPP Note were restricted to only being used for payroll costs (including benefits), interest on mortgage obligations, rent, utilities and interest on certain other debt obligations. The proceeds from the PPP Note were used in the operation of the Company and therefore the debt was included in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company. We fully utilized the proceeds from this loan to satisfy certain payroll and benefit obligations and applied for relief of the full amount of the loan under the PPP. In June 2021, the PPP loan was forgiven and the liability removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The forgiveness was recorded as a gain on debt forgiveness and is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations of the Company.\nLetters of Credit and Performance Bonds\nIn the ordinary course of business, and as part of the entitlement and development process, the Company's subsidiaries are required to provide performance bonds to assure completion of certain public facilities. The Company had $94.7 million and $78.0 million of performance bonds outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to the improvements at these sites, the performance bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed.\nFinancial Covenants\nOur loans have certain financial covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum liquidity balance, minimum tangible net worth, as well as maximum leverage and interest coverage ratios. See the table below for the covenant calculations.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenants </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td>Covenant Requirement </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum Liquidity Covenant </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346,889 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,000 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Coverage Ratio - Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Incurred </td> <td> </td> <td>3.69 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Net Worth </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>596,030 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>329,182 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Leverage Ratio (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>18.7% </td> <td> </td> <td><65% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Calculation is debt, net of certain cash amounts, divided by that same net debt balance plus tangible net worth.\nThe loan agreements also contain certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on incurrence of other indebtedness, liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions, investments, and limitations on fundamental changes. The agreements contain customary events of default, subject to cure periods in certain circumstances, that would result in the termination of the commitments and permit the lender to accelerate payment on outstanding borrowings. These events of default include nonpayment of principal, interest and fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties; cross default to certain other indebtedness; unpaid judgments; change in control; and certain bankruptcy and other insolvency events. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants.\n- 65 -\nCash Flows-Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the comparison of cash flows is as follows:\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $33.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $13.6 million during 2020. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to proceeds from home sales, with net income growing $61.8 million compared to 2020. This was partially offset by more cash paid to acquire real estate inventories by $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $19.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This difference was the result of additional land acquisitions and higher construction costs during the period related to a higher number of communities, a portion of which have not yet begun selling homes. Accounts payable resulting from this construction activity also increased during the year by $35.9 million which affected the timing of our cash flows from operating activities.\n\u2022Net cash used in investing activities was $25.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $125.1 million cash used in investing activities during the same period in 2020. This difference was primarily related to the size of our acquisitions in the comparable periods. Payments for the acquisition of Vintage, net of cash received, was $44.5 million, compared to $128.5 million used in the acquisition of Garrett Walker, net of cash received, in 2020. Distributions of capital from the Avora unconsolidated joint venture provided $22.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 2020.\n\u2022Net cash provided by financing activities was $225.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $65.2 million during the same period in 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is due to a net increase in cash from notes and other debts payable of $172.8 million, compared to an increase in net borrowings of $94.4 million in 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the new credit facility we entered into. The increase was also due in large part to net proceeds of $64.4 million from the Merger which consisted of cash proceeds of $100.7 million less cash paid to the public warrant holders to amend the public warrants of $28.7 million and $7.5 million paid for offering related costs. Cash from the Merger was also used to pay off a convertible note of $1.5 million assumed in the Merger. In addition, during 2020 the aforementioned cash proceeds were partially offset by a $15.4 million final distribution to a noncontrolling interest related to one of our consolidated joint ventures. There was no such distribution during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOption Contracts\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit, and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements. We also utilize option contracts with land sellers and others as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from financing sources. Option contracts generally require payment of a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. Our obligations with respect to purchase contracts and option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding purchase and option contracts totaling $399.1 million, and had $63.6 million of related cash deposits pertaining to these contracts.\nThe utilization of land option contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to financial intermediaries to finance the\n- 66 -\ndevelopment of optioned lots, general housing market conditions, and local market dynamics. Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe material cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt maturities (\u00b9)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>472,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>390,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (\u00b2)\n</td> <td>14,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (\u00b3)\n</td> <td>399,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Principal payments in accordance with the line of credit and construction loans. Total future interest payments of $41.9 million associated with our current outstanding debt are based on the current outstanding balance and interest rate as of December 31, 2021 through maturity.\n(2) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to property owners covering common area maintenance charges.\n(3) Includes the remaining purchase price for all land option and purchase contracts, net of deposits, as of December 31, 2021.\nWe are subject to certain requirements associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties until we have determined whether to exercise our option, which may serve to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At December 31, 2021, we had $63.6 million of deposits, of which none are refundable. We expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next four years. Our performance on these contracts, including the timing and amount of purchase, if any, on the remaining purchase and option contracts is subject to change.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity during the spring, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to eight months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occurs during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe include non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted home sales gross margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net debt to net capital, and adjusted net income. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors additional insights to facilitate the analysis of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies may use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented.\n- 67 -\nNet Debt to Net Capital\nThe following table presents the ratio of debt to capital as well as the ratio of net debt to net capital which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ratio of debt to capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net of issuance costs, by total capital (sum of total debt, net of issuance costs, plus total equity).\nThe non-GAAP ratio of net debt to net capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net of issuance costs less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as well as cash held in escrow to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by net capital (sum of net debt plus total equity). We have updated the calculation of net debt to net capital for the year ended December 31, 2020 to reduce debt by the amount of cash held in escrow to be consistent with our presentation for the year ended December 31, 2021. The most comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. We believe the ratio of net debt to net capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt to capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio of net debt to net capital provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered.\nSee table below reconciling this non-GAAP measure to the ratio of debt to capital.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total notes and other debts payable, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity </td> <td>621,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,082,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>794,295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of debt to capital </td> <td>42.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total notes and other debts payable, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>343,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash held in escrow </td> <td>4,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,618 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt </td> <td>113,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity </td> <td>621,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>529,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>735,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>672,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of net debt to net capital </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in evaluating operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) income tax expense (benefit), (ii) interest expenses, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) inventory impairments, (v) purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, (vi) (gain) loss on debt extinguishment, (vii) transaction costs related to the Merger and business combinations, (viii) the impact of income or loss allocations from our unconsolidated joint ventures, (ix) gain on forgiveness of PPP loan, and (x) gain (loss) on remeasurement of warrant liability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest, effective tax rates, levels of depreciation and amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. The economic activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures is not core to our operations and is the reason we have excluded those amounts. Accordingly, we believe this measure is useful for\n- 68 -\ncomparing our core operating performance from period to period. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,084) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes </td> <td>13,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,081) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest in cost of sales </td> <td>33,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest relieved to equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td>1,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td>106,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory impairments </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase price accounting in cost of home sales </td> <td>14,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs </td> <td>5,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of interest </td> <td>(2,529) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on PPP loan forgiveness </td> <td>(4,266) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on remeasurement of warrant liability </td> <td>(2,090) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Imputed interest in cost of sales (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(776) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,024) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Imputed interest related to a land banking transaction that was treated as a product financing arrangement.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income to LHC is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating results without the effect of certain expenses that were historically pushed down by our parent company and other non-recurring items. We believe excluding these items provides a more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted Net Income to LHC is calculated by excluding the effects of related party interest that was pushed down by our parent company, purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, the impact from our unconsolidated joint ventures, merger related transaction costs, gain on forgiveness of PPP loan, and gain (loss) on remeasurement of warrant liability, and tax-effected using a blended statutory tax rate. The economic activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures is not core to our operations and is the reason we have excluded those amounts. We also adjust for the expense of\n- 69 -\nrelated party interest pushed down from our parent company as we have no obligation to repay the debt and related interest.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,951) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory impairments </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Previously capitalized related party interest included in cost of sales </td> <td>11,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(1,262) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,901 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase price accounting for acquired inventory </td> <td>14,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger related transaction costs </td> <td>2,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on PPP loan forgiveness </td> <td>(4,266) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on remeasurement of warrant liability </td> <td>(2,090) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjustments </td> <td>21,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-effected adjustments (1)\n</td> <td>14,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,721 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income attributable to Landsea Homes Corporation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n- 70 -", "summary": "The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Landsea Homes Corporation discusses the financial performance for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n- 49 -\nConsolidated Financial Data\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n- 50 -\nBusiness Overview\nDriven by a commitment to sustainability, Landsea Homes Corporation (\"LHC\") designs and builds homes and communities in Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and the Metro New York area. We create inspired spaces for modern living and feature homes and communities in vibrant, prime locations which connect seamlessly with their surroundings and enhance the local lifestyle for living, working, and playing. The defining principle, Live in Your Element\u00ae,\u201d creates the foundation for our customers to live where they want to live, how they want to live - in a home created especially for them.\nThe Company's operations are engaged in the acquisition, development, and sale of homes and lots in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. The Company's operations are organized into five reportable segments: Arizona, California, Florida, Metro New York, and Texas. The Company builds and sells an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points but focus our efforts on the first-time homebuyer. Our Corporate operations are a non-operating segment to support our homebuilding operations by providing executive, finance, treasury, human resources, accounting and legal services.\nOn January 18, 2022, we acquired 100% of Hanover Family Builders, LLC (\"Hanover\"), a Florida-based homebuilder for an aggregate cash purchase price of $179.2 million. The Hanover acquisition increases our presence in Florida with backlog of approximately 520 units valued at approximately $228 million as of the acquisition date.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions across the United States began to impact our business at the end of the first quarter of 2020. This impacted our construction phases and our ability to complete the legal and regulatory steps to close homes. As restrictions related to COVID-19 eased, our ability to progress with home construction and related deliveries improved significantly during the remainder of 2020 and remained strong throughout 2021. With the lifting of restrictions we also saw significant increases in demand across our markets. We believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and a general tightening supply of homes for sale. These macroeconomic effects have allowed us to increase prices and derive additional revenue from our home deliveries; however we frequently see those increased revenues partially offset by higher costs associated with labor and supply shortages. In certain markets we have seen our construction cycle lengthen primarily due to supply chain constraints and in those markets we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production level. Based on the current availability of labor and materials, the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory, and production schedules, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in some of our communities in the near term.\nStrategy\nThe Company's strategy is focused on maximizing shareholder returns through profitability and efficiency, while balancing appropriate amounts of leverage. In general, we are focused on the following long-term strategic objectives:\n\u2022Expand community count in current markets and enhance operating returns\n\u2022Maintain an appropriate supply of lots\n\u2022Continue to focus on entry-level product offerings\n\u2022Strengthen unique brand position through product differentiation\n\u2022Continue geographic expansion and diversification into new markets\n\u2022Leverage existing SG&A base to enhance stockholder returns and profitability\n\u2022Become a top-ten homebuilder in the United States\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures of a company's performance that exclude or include amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The presentation of non-GAAP\n- 51 -\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe present non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted home sales gross margin, net debt to net capital, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income in their respective sections below to enhance an investor's evaluation of the ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of the results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting.\nResults of Operations\nDuring 2021, we continued our strategy of shifting our inventory and product to more affordable price points. In May 2021, we completed our homebuilder acquisition in the Florida and Texas markets by purchasing 100% of the membership interests of Vintage Estate Homes (\"Vintage\"). This acquisition expanded our business into Florida and Texas with an inventory of approximately 1,800 lots, in various stage of development. The combination of our investments in the Florida and Texas markets and strong activity in the existing California and Arizona markets during 2021 resulted in a 27% year-over-year increase in home sales revenue and a 7% increase in homes delivered from 1,527 units in 2020 to 1,640 units in 2021. The larger increase in home sales revenue as compared to home deliveries reflects the increasing price appreciation in each of our markets along with the strong performance of our California market which typically has a higher average selling price (\"ASP\") than the other markets we operate in.\nWe remain focused on growth and view our leverageaccess to capital markets and the generation of free cash flow form operations as a key factor in allowing us to expand. Even as the Company has grown organically and through business acquisitions in recent years, we remain in a position to act on our strategy and to be opportunistic about acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Our debt to capital ratio increased to 42.6% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 33.3% as of December 31, 2020, and our cash and cash equivalents increased to $342.8 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $105.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We believe the combination of cash and modest leverage levels of our balance sheet position us well to continue to execute our growth strategy.\nWe anticipate the homebuilding markets in each of our operating segments to be tied to both the local economy and the macroeconomic environment. Accordingly, net orders, home deliveries, and ASPs in future years could be negatively affected by economic conditions, such as decreases in employment and median household incomes, as well as decreases in household formations and increasing supply of inventories. Shortages in labor or materials could also significantly increase costs, reduce gross margins, and lower our overall profitability. During 2021 we experienced increases in our production cycle times due to labor and material shortages that have caused us to reduce our absorption rate in certain markets, primarily in our Arizona segment. Additionally, the results could be impacted by a decrease in home affordability as a result of price appreciation, increases in mortgage interest rates, or tightening of mortgage lending standards.\n- 52 -\nNet New Home Orders, Dollar Value of Orders, and Monthly Absorption Rates\nChanges in the dollar value of net new orders are impacted by changes in the number of net new orders and the average selling price of those homes. Monthly Absorption Rate is calculated as total net new orders per period, divided by the average active communities during the period, divided by the number of months per period.\n\n(1) Monthly Absorption Rate for Florida and Texas in 2021 is based on eight months for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes in May 2021.\n(2) The ASP calculation for our Texas segment is not a meaningful disclosure as presented above due to cancellations and renegotiation of contract terms during the period presented. Our seven new sales contracts during the period from acquisition to December 31, 2021 had an ASP of $1,121 thousand.\n\n1) Monthly Absorption Rate for Arizona in 2019 is based on seven months for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Pinnacle West in June 2019.\nNet new home orders decreased in 2021 due to a decrease in Arizona orders, partially offset by an increase in California home sales and the start of sales in Florida and Metro New York.\nThe decrease in Arizona is primarily due to intentional delays in our sales process. We are experiencing constraints in our production processes due to labor and material shortages for homes currently under construction and that has extended our production cycle. We expect such delays are likely to continue in the short-term. The year-over-year change in dollar value of net new home orders in Arizona is less impacted due to a 32% increase in ASP during the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, the increase in net new orders in California was primarily due to a slight increase in the monthly absorption rate, which was driven by entry-level communities with a lower ASP that sold at a much faster pace.\nOur new Florida segment, beginning from the acquisition of Vintage, has provided steady orders with a slightly increasing ASP over the year, beginning in May 2021. We continue to purchase more lots in Florida to support and\n- 53 -\ngrow our operations there and our acquisition of Hanover on January 18, 2022 significantly adds to our Florida segment.\nThe Metro New York segment has not yet delivered any homes, other than those through unconsolidated joint ventures. The units within this segment remain in various stages of construction and opened for sale in 2021. The total increase in ASP for net orders is largely due to the high dollar value of the units in our Metro New York segment.\nOur Texas segment had eight net cancellations due to pre-acquisition sales contracts that did not reflect current costs. Throughout the year, pre-acquisition contracts continued to be renegotiated or cancelled and the associated homes resold, increasing the sales dollar value of new sales and the ASP of homes in backlog.\nAverage Selling Communities\nAverage selling communities is the sum of communities actively selling each month, divided by the total months in the calculation period.\n\n(1) Average selling communities calculations for Florida and Texas in 2021 are based on eight months, for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage in May 2021. Average selling communities calculations for Arizona in 2019 are based on seven months, for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Pinnacle West in June 2019.\n- 54 -\nHome Deliveries and Home Sales Revenue\nChanges in home sales revenue are the result of changes in the number of homes delivered and the ASP of those delivered homes. Commentary on significant changes for each of the segments in these metrics is provided below.\n\n\nDuring 2021, the Arizona segment delivered 771 homes with an ASP of $0.4 million and generated $276.2 million in home sales revenue. The decrease in home closings and home sales revenue compared to the same periods in 2020 was primarily attributable to production delays partially offset by an increase in ASP of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes delivered in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the year-over-year increase in home sales revenue and deliveries in the California segment of 34% and 46%, respectively, was the result of strengthening market conditions, including strong demand and rising prices in the current period.

Monthly Absorption Rate is calculated as total net new orders per period, divided by the average active communities during the period, divided by the number of months per period.\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Homes </td> <td>Dollar Value </td> <td>ASP </td> <td>Monthly Absorption Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arizona </td> <td>685 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,474 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,283 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,338 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(29) </td> <td>% </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td>631 </td> <td> </td> <td>563,922 </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td>566,078 </td> <td> </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida (1)\n</td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td>65,046 </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metro New York </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td>50,687 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas (1)(2)\n</td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td>(692) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>1,471 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>963,437 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,891 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>968,416 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(27) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Monthly Absorption Rate for Florida and Texas in 2021 is based on eight months for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes in May 2021.\n(2) The ASP calculation for our Texas segment is not a meaningful disclosure as presented above due to cancellations and renegotiation of contract terms during the period presented.

We are experiencing constraints in our production processes due to labor and material shortages for homes currently under construction and that has extended our production cycle. We expect such delays are likely to continue in the short-term. The year-over-year change in dollar value of net new home orders in Arizona is less impacted due to a 32% increase in ASP during the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, the increase in net new orders in California was primarily due to a slight increase in the monthly absorption rate, which was driven by entry-level communities with a lower ASP that sold at a much faster pace.\nOur new Florida segment, beginning from the acquisition of Vintage, has provided steady orders with a slightly increasing ASP over the year, beginning in May 2021. We continue to purchase more lots in Florida to support and\n- 53 -\ngrow our operations there and our acquisition of Hanover on January 18, 2022 significantly adds to our Florida segment.\nThe Metro New York segment has not yet delivered any homes, other than those through unconsolidated joint ventures. The units within this segment remain in various stages of construction and opened for sale in 2021. The total increase in ASP for net orders is largely due to the high dollar value of the units in our Metro New York segment.\nOur Texas segment had eight net cancellations due to pre-acquisition sales contracts that did not reflect current costs. Throughout the year, pre-acquisition contracts continued to be renegotiated or cancelled and the associated homes resold, increasing the sales dollar value of new sales and the ASP of homes in backlog.\nAverage Selling Communities\nAverage selling communities is the sum of communities actively selling each month, divided by the total months in the calculation period.\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arizona (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(33) </td> <td>% </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>230 </td> <td>% </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metro New York </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td>% </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Average selling communities calculations for Florida and Texas in 2021 are based on eight months, for the time subsequent to the acquisition of Vintage in May 2021.

The decrease in home closings and home sales revenue compared to the same periods in 2020 was primarily attributable to production delays partially offset by an increase in ASP of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to price appreciation in the Arizona market and a larger number of homes delivered in communities with higher-end products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the year-over-year increase in home sales revenue and deliveries in the California segment of 34% and 46%, respectively, was the result of strengthening market conditions, including strong demand and rising prices in the current period.
