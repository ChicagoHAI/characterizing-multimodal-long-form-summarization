See Part I, Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the forward-looking statements contained below and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of certain risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 have been revised to correct for prior period errors as discussed in Item 8 - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect the effects of the revisions.\nOverview\nWe have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had over 267,000 individual users across more than 3,000 customers exclusive of on-premise software. Additionally, we continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers, and resellers.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. ( BlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the 2013 Acquisition.\u201d The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.\nOur platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, and Compliance. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub and Smart Close.\nWe derived approximately 94% of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform and approximately 6% from professional services for the year ended December 31, 2019. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts, with a growing percentage of subscriptions sold through three-year contracts. We price our subscriptions based on a number of factors, primarily the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal.\nProfessional services consist of implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed. We also provide consulting services to help customers optimize the use of our products. We charge customers for our consulting services on a time-and-materials basis and we recognize that revenue as services are performed.\nWe typically invoice customers annually in advance for annual and multi-year subscriptions and invoice in advance or on a time-and-materials basis for professional services. We record amounts invoiced for portions of annual subscription periods that have not occurred or services that have not been performed as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, our solution is an SAP endorsed\nbusiness solution that integrates with SAP's ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our accounting solutions, for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. Since October 1, 2018, we are no longer obligated to pay SAP a fee based on a percentage of revenues from our new customers that use an SAP ERP solution.\nOur ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our sales and customer success teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nThe length of our sales cycle depends on the size of the potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Hub. As we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in our results for any particular period.\nWe have historically signed a high percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month of the quarter. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into the fourth quarter or last month of any quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is minimal due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had revenues totaling $289.0 million, $227.8 million, and $175.6 million, respectively, and we incurred net losses attributable to Blackline, Inc. of $32.5 million, $28.7 million, and $33.4 million, respectively.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Each of the metrics below exclude the impact of on-premise software.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dollar-based net revenue retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate. We believe that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and grow our relationships with existing customers over time. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention rate as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. We define implied monthly subscription and support revenue as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of our customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our customer success and sales teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nNumber of customers. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is\ninvoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.\nNumber of users. Since our customers generally pay fees based on the number of users of our platform within their organization, we believe the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of our business. We are also beginning to sell an increasing number of non-user based strategic products, such as Transaction Matching and Intercompany Hub.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nSubscription and support. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts and a growing percentage of subscriptions are sold through three-year contracts. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. At any time during the subscription period, customers may increase their number of users and add products. Additional fees are payable for the remainder of the initial or renewed contract term. Customers may only reduce their number of users or subscription to products upon renewal of their arrangement. Revenues from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform comprised approximately 94% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with sales of on-premise software licenses and related support. Prior to our migration to SaaS in 2012, we licensed our legacy on-premise software. We no longer develop any new applications or functionality for our legacy on-premise software, but we continue to provide post-contract support to one customer that had not migrated to our SaaS solution at December 31, 2019.\nProfessional services. We offer our customers implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee. We also provide consulting and training services to help customers optimize the use of our products. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. We apply the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when we have the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. Professional services revenues comprised approximately 6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription and support cost of revenues. Subscription and support cost of revenues primarily consists of amortization of developed technology costs resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our hosting operations and support personnel, data center costs related to hosting our cloud-based software, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. We also allocate a portion of overhead to subscription and support cost of revenues.\nProfessional services costs of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our implementation personnel. These costs are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. We also allocate a portion of overhead to professional services cost of revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, commissions paid in connection with our strategic relationships, outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual conference, advertising, and trade shows, other event expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets. We defer sales and partner commissions and amortize them over an estimated period of\nbenefit of five years. We expect the annual trend in sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our direct sales teams and increase sales through our strategic relationships and resellers.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel and allocated overhead costs. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Other than internal-use software development costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs to increase as we develop new solutions and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, recruitment costs, other corporate-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not to compete and tradename intangible assets, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly-traded company, including legal, audit and consulting fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in August 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrant Liability\nWe issued warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our credit facility. The warrants were measured at fair value each period, with changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The stock warrants were exercised in May 2017 and, accordingly, there will be no further changes in the fair value recorded in our results of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that realization of the deferred tax assets, including consideration of our deferred tax liabilities, is not more likely than not. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for both federal and state income taxes, our deferred assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities and because of our recent history of operating losses we believe that the realization of the deferred tax assets is currently not more likely than not. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful to us and our investors in evaluating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide consistency and comparability with our past performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,535\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33,408\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 239,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for the amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of gross margin between periods.\nNon-GAAP Net Income. Non-GAAP net income is defined as GAAP net loss adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes that we were able to recognize as a result of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets established upon the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability, legal settlement gains, cost incurred in relation to our secondary offering, cost incurred relating to our shelf offering, and adjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net income is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, purchase accounting and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of net income (loss) between current and historical periods.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit, gross margin, and net loss, the most comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP net income:\nTable 123:

The increase in capitalized software costs was primarily due to an increase in our headcount, as well as higher capitalization rates.\nGeneral and administrative\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to an $8.0 million increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation and a $1.8 million increase in professional services expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization. The increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation was primarily driven by a 20% increase in average headcount from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in amortization relating to developed technology from the 2013 Acquisition, which became fully amortized in the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; a $1.9 million increase in foreign currency losses; a $0.9 million increase in overhead-related expenses; a $0.4 million increase in travel-related costs; and a $0.2 million increase in computer software expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in bad debt expense primarily related to older receivables for on-premise license receivables that were reserved for in 2017; a $0.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization; and a $0.2 million decrease in contingent consideration expense related to the increase in fair value of the contingent consideration. The increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation was primarily driven by a 27% increase in average headcount from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in foreign currency losses was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency rates related to the Euro and British Pound during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, on open intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. Overhead-related expenses increased primarily due to the expansion of our corporate headquarters in 2018.\nInterest income\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December

United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our annual estimated effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily as a result of state taxes, foreign taxes, and changes in our valuation allowance for domestic income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $1.7 million and $1.1 million in income tax expense, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was attributable to increased profitability in our international operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity was an aggregate of $607.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consist of short-term, investment-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. treasury securities. We had $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. We have the ability to settle the Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. The Notes were not convertible at December 31, 2019.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls with the counterparties covering, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 6.8 million shares of our common stock. If the Capped Calls are exercised and the market value per share of our common stock is greater than the strike price of $73.40 of the Capped Calls but not greater than the cap price of $106.76 for the Capped Calls, we expect to receive from the counterparties a number of shares of our common stock or, at our election (subject to certain conditions), cash, with an aggregate market value (or, in the case of cash settlement, in an amount) approximately equal to the product of such excess times the number of shares of our common stock relating to the Capped Calls being exercised. As a result, the Capped Calls are expected to offset the potential dilution as a result of conversion of the Notes unless we elect, at our option and subject to certain conditions specified under the Capped Calls, for the options to be settled in cash rather than shares of our common stock. If, however,\nthe market value per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Calls at the time of exercise, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, the number of shares of our common stock or the amount of cash we expect to receive upon the exercise of the Capped Calls will be capped at a number of shares of our common stock with an aggregate market value approximately equal to (1) the excess of the cap price of the Capped Calls over the strike price of the Capped Calls times (2) the number of shares of our common stock relating to the Capped Calls (or the portions thereof) being exercised, and the dilution mitigation under the Capped Calls will be limited to such capped number of shares of our common stock we expect to receive. It is our current intent to settle conversions of the Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and financing obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of our direct sales force, strategic relationships and international operations, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We may require or opportunistically raise additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise funds by borrowing from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements would require us to incur interest expense and may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available at all or, if available, that we would be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we would be required to curtail our operating activities and capital expenditures, and our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (408,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,977\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,031\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 452,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support anticipated growth. In recent periods, our net loss has generally been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to our subscription-based revenue model in which billings occur in advance of revenue recognition, as well as the substantial amount of non-cash charges which we incur. Non-cash charges primarily include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, and deferred taxes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operations was $29.7 million, resulting from net non-cash expenses of $68.2 million, partially offset by our net loss of $32.1 million and net cash flow used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million. The $6.3 million of net cash flows used as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected a $28.0 million increase in accounts receivable; a $16.4 million increase in other assets; and a $5.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities. These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were largely offset by a $33.4 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of the growth of our customer and user base; a $5.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily associated with increases in employee-related accruals as a result of increases in headcount and bonuses; a $3.2 million increase accounts payable; and a $1.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operations was $16.1 million resulting from net non-cash expenses of $43.3 million and net cash flow provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million, largely offset by our net loss of $28.8 million. The $1.6 million of net cash flows provided as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected a $24.7 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of the growth of our customer and user base and a $4.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily associated\nwith increases in employee-related accruals as a result of increases in headcount and bonuses. This change in our operating assets and liabilities was largely offset by a $13.2 million increase in accounts receivable; a $9.5 million increase in other assets; a $4.0 million decrease in accounts payable; and a $0.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operations was $6.4 million resulting from net non-cash expenses of $40.8 million, largely offset by our net loss of $33.4 million and net cash flow used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.0 million. The $1.0 million of net cash flows used as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected a $20.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to the growth of our customer and user base; a $7.2 million increase in other assets; a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets; and a $0.2 million decrease in other long-term liabilities. These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a $26.5 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of the growth of our customer and user base, which are billed in advance of our revenue recognition, and a $2.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily associated with increases in employee-related accruals as a result of increases in headcount and bonuses.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of investments in and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software development costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $408.5 million as a result of $398.8 million of purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, $5.1 million in capitalized software development costs, and $4.6 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $16.0 million as a result of $6.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, $5.7 million in capitalized software development costs, and $4.0 million of purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities and sales.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $7.0 million as a result of $4.6 million in capitalized software development costs and $4.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.6 million proceeds from maturities, net of purchases of marketable securities.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $452.5 million primarily as a result of net proceeds of $441.0 million from the issuance of the Notes and the purchase of the associated Capped Calls; $10.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options; and $5.3 million of proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.9 million of acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $14.5 million primarily as a result of $14.0 million of proceeds from the exercises of stock options and a $4.3 million investment from our redeemable non-controlling interest, partially offset by $3.4 million of acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations and $0.4 million of principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $9.6 million primarily as a result of $10.3 million of proceeds from the exercises of stock options, partially offset by $0.5 million of principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nBacklog\nWe enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be backlog. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had backlog of approximately $366.9 million and $285.0 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and\nduration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance. We do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are required to pay up to a maximum of $8.0 million of contingent consideration relating to our 2013 Acquisition if we realize a tax benefit from the use of net operating losses generated from the stock option exercises concurrent with the 2013 Acquisition. We have not included this obligation in the table above because there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows to extinguish this liability. The settlement of this liability depends on our ability to generate taxable income in the future to realize this tax benefit.\nAt December 31, 2019, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.7 million were not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.\nCommitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2019 were scheduled to expire as follows (in thousands):\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLetters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements. The letters of credit remain in effect at varying levels through the terms of the related agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors and officers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. We have never paid a material claim, nor have we been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. At December 31, 2019, we had not accrued a liability for these indemnification arrangements because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation, if any, in connection with these indemnification arrangements is not probable or reasonably estimable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nAssets recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer - We recognize an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs to our employees (\"deferred customer contract acquisition costs\") and our partners (\"partner referral fees\") meet the requirements to be capitalized. Deferred customer acquisition costs related to new revenue contracts and upsells are deferred and then amortized straight line over the expected period of benefit that we have determined to be five years, based upon both the product turnover rate and estimated customer life. Partner referral fees are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual period, as the fees for renewals are commensurate with fees incurred for the initial contract. Deferred customer acquisition costs and partner referral fees are included within other assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). We capitalize certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These capitalized costs exclude training costs, project management costs, and data migration costs. We capitalize certain costs in the development of our SaaS subscription solutions when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related expenses for employees and costs of third-party contractors who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects and, when material, interest costs incurred during the development. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades and enhancements to our SaaS software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for post-configuration training, maintenance and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of the company.

See Part I, Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the forward-looking statements contained below and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of certain risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 have been revised to correct for prior period errors as discussed in Item 8 - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect the effects of the revisions.\nOverview\nWe have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had over 267,000 individual users across more than 3,000 customers exclusive of on-premise software. Additionally, we continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers, and resellers.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. ( BlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the 2013 Acquisition.\u201d The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.\nOur platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, and Compliance. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub and Smart Close.\nWe derived approximately 94% of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform and approximately 6% from professional services for the year ended December 31, 2019. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts, with a growing percentage of subscriptions sold through three-year contracts. We price our subscriptions based on a number of factors, primarily the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal.\nProfessional services consist of implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed. We also provide consulting services to help customers optimize the use of our products. We charge customers for our consulting services on a time-and-materials basis and we recognize that revenue as services are performed.\nWe typically invoice customers annually in advance for annual and multi-year subscriptions and invoice in advance or on a time-and-materials basis for professional services. We record amounts invoiced for portions of annual subscription periods that have not occurred or services that have not been performed as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, our solution is an SAP endorsed\nbusiness solution that integrates with SAP's ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our accounting solutions, for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. Since October 1, 2018, we are no longer obligated to pay SAP a fee based on a percentage of revenues from our new customers that use an SAP ERP solution.\nOur ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our sales and customer success teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nThe length of our sales cycle depends on the size of the potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Hub. As we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in our results for any particular period.\nWe have historically signed a high percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month of the quarter. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into the fourth quarter or last month of any quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is minimal due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had revenues totaling $289.0 million, $227.8 million, and $175.6 million, respectively, and we incurred net losses attributable to Blackline, Inc. of $32.5 million, $28.7 million, and $33.4 million, respectively.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Each of the metrics below exclude the impact of on-premise software.\n\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate. We believe that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and grow our relationships with existing customers over time. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention rate as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. We define implied monthly subscription and support revenue as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of our customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our customer success and sales teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nNumber of customers. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is\ninvoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.\nNumber of users. Since our customers generally pay fees based on the number of users of our platform within their organization, we believe the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of our business. We are also beginning to sell an increasing number of non-user based strategic products, such as Transaction Matching and Intercompany Hub.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nSubscription and support. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts and a growing percentage of subscriptions are sold through three-year contracts. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. At any time during the subscription period, customers may increase their number of users and add products. Additional fees are payable for the remainder of the initial or renewed contract term. Customers may only reduce their number of users or subscription to products upon renewal of their arrangement. Revenues from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform comprised approximately 94% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with sales of on-premise software licenses and related support. Prior to our migration to SaaS in 2012, we licensed our legacy on-premise software. We no longer develop any new applications or functionality for our legacy on-premise software, but we continue to provide post-contract support to one customer that had not migrated to our SaaS solution at December 31, 2019.\nProfessional services. We offer our customers implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee. We also provide consulting and training services to help customers optimize the use of our products. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. We apply the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when we have the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. Professional services revenues comprised approximately 6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription and support cost of revenues. Subscription and support cost of revenues primarily consists of amortization of developed technology costs resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our hosting operations and support personnel, data center costs related to hosting our cloud-based software, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. We also allocate a portion of overhead to subscription and support cost of revenues.\nProfessional services costs of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our implementation personnel. These costs are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. We also allocate a portion of overhead to professional services cost of revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, commissions paid in connection with our strategic relationships, outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual conference, advertising, and trade shows, other event expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets. We defer sales and partner commissions and amortize them over an estimated period of\nbenefit of five years. We expect the annual trend in sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our direct sales teams and increase sales through our strategic relationships and resellers.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel and allocated overhead costs. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Other than internal-use software development costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs to increase as we develop new solutions and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, recruitment costs, other corporate-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not to compete and tradename intangible assets, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly-traded company, including legal, audit and consulting fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in August 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrant Liability\nWe issued warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our credit facility. The warrants were measured at fair value each period, with changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The stock warrants were exercised in May 2017 and, accordingly, there will be no further changes in the fair value recorded in our results of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that realization of the deferred tax assets, including consideration of our deferred tax liabilities, is not more likely than not. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for both federal and state income taxes, our deferred assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities and because of our recent history of operating losses we believe that the realization of the deferred tax assets is currently not more likely than not. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful to us and our investors in evaluating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide consistency and comparability with our past performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for the amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of gross margin between periods.\nNon-GAAP Net Income. Non-GAAP net income is defined as GAAP net loss adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes that we were able to recognize as a result of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets established upon the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability, legal settlement gains, cost incurred in relation to our secondary offering, cost incurred relating to our shelf offering, and adjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net income is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, purchase accounting and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of net income (loss) between current and historical periods.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit, gross margin, and net loss, the most comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP net income:\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected historical consolidated statements of operations data, which should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Contractual Obligations and Commitments included in this Item 7, as well as Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated statements of operations information was as follows (in thousands):\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and reflects the revisions as discussed in Item 8 - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d:\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017\nRevenues\n\n\nThe increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers, an increase in the number of users added by existing customers, an increase in the number of products purchased by existing customers in the period, and an increase in non-user based strategic product sales. The total number of customers and users increased by 15% and 20%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers, an increase in the number of users added by existing customers, an increase in the number of products purchased by existing customers in the period, and an increase in non-user based strategic product sales. The total number of customers and users increased by 19% and 13%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of revenues\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect the effects of the revisions.\nOverview\nWe have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had over 267,000 individual users across more than 3,000 customers exclusive of on-premise software. Additionally, we continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers, and resellers.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. ( BlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the 2013 Acquisition.\u201d The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.\nOur platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, and Compliance. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub and Smart Close.\nWe derived approximately 94% of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform and approximately 6% from professional services for the year ended December 31, 2019. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts, with a growing percentage of subscriptions sold through three-year contracts. We price our subscriptions based on a number of factors, primarily the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal.\nProfessional services consist of implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed. We also provide consulting services to help customers optimize the use of our products. We charge customers for our consulting services on a time-and-materials basis and we recognize that revenue as services are performed.\nWe typically invoice customers annually in advance for annual and multi-year subscriptions and invoice in advance or on a time-and-materials basis for professional services. We record amounts invoiced for portions of annual subscription periods that have not occurred or services that have not been performed as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, our solution is an SAP endorsed\nbusiness solution that integrates with SAP's ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our accounting solutions, for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. Since October 1, 2018, we are no longer obligated to pay SAP a fee based on a percentage of revenues from our new customers that use an SAP ERP solution.\nOur ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our sales and customer success teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nThe length of our sales cycle depends on the size of the potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Hub. As we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in our results for any particular period.\nWe have historically signed a high percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month of the quarter. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into the fourth quarter or last month of any quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is minimal due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had revenues totaling $289.0 million, $227.8 million, and $175.6 million, respectively, and we incurred net losses attributable to Blackline, Inc. of $32.5 million, $28.7 million, and $33.4 million, respectively.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Each of the metrics below exclude the impact of on-premise software.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dollar-based net revenue retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of users\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate. We believe that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and grow our relationships with existing customers over time. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention rate as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. We define implied monthly subscription and support revenue as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of our customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our customer success and sales teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nNumber of customers. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is\ninvoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.\nNumber of users. Since our customers generally pay fees based on the number of users of our platform within their organization, we believe the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of our business. We are also beginning to sell an increasing number of non-user based strategic products, such as Transaction Matching and Intercompany Hub.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nSubscription and support. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts and a growing percentage of subscriptions are sold through three-year contracts. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. At any time during the subscription period, customers may increase their number of users and add products. Additional fees are payable for the remainder of the initial or renewed contract term. Customers may only reduce their number of users or subscription to products upon renewal of their arrangement. Revenues from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform comprised approximately 94% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with sales of on-premise software licenses and related support. Prior to our migration to SaaS in 2012, we licensed our legacy on-premise software. We no longer develop any new applications or functionality for our legacy on-premise software, but we continue to provide post-contract support to one customer that had not migrated to our SaaS solution at December 31, 2019.\nProfessional services. We offer our customers implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee. We also provide consulting and training services to help customers optimize the use of our products. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. We apply the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when we have the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. Professional services revenues comprised approximately 6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription and support cost of revenues. Subscription and support cost of revenues primarily consists of amortization of developed technology costs resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our hosting operations and support personnel, data center costs related to hosting our cloud-based software, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. We also allocate a portion of overhead to subscription and support cost of revenues.\nProfessional services costs of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our implementation personnel. These costs are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. We also allocate a portion of overhead to professional services cost of revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, commissions paid in connection with our strategic relationships, outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual conference, advertising, and trade shows, other event expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets. We defer sales and partner commissions and amortize them over an estimated period of\nbenefit of five years. We expect the annual trend in sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our direct sales teams and increase sales through our strategic relationships and resellers.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel and allocated overhead costs. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Other than internal-use software development costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs to increase as we develop new solutions and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, recruitment costs, other corporate-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not to compete and tradename intangible assets, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly-traded company, including legal, audit and consulting fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in August 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrant Liability\nWe issued warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our credit facility. The warrants were measured at fair value each period, with changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. The stock warrants were exercised in May 2017 and, accordingly, there will be no further changes in the fair value recorded in our results of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that realization of the deferred tax assets, including consideration of our deferred tax liabilities, is not more likely than not. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for both federal and state income taxes, our deferred assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities and because of our recent history of operating losses we believe that the realization of the deferred tax assets is currently not more likely than not. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful to us and our investors in evaluating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide consistency and comparability with our past performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,535\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33,408\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 239,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for the amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of gross margin between periods.\nNon-GAAP Net Income. Non-GAAP net income is defined as GAAP net loss adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes that we were able to recognize as a result of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets established upon the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, stock-based compensation, the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability, legal settlement gains, cost incurred in relation to our secondary offering, cost incurred relating to our shelf offering, and adjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net income is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the 2013 Acquisition and the Runbook Acquisition, purchase accounting and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of net income (loss) between current and historical periods.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following
