Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Owl Rock Capital Corporation II and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOwl Rock Capital Corporation II (the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, or our\u201d) is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Maryland corporation on October 15, 2015, we are externally managed by Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC (the Adviser\u201d) which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. On March 15, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC originates loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe are managed by our Adviser. Our Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\"). Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services, to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain organizational activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. Our Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of management professionals. Our Board consists of eight directors, five of whom are independent.\nWe commenced a continuous public offering for up to 264,000,000 shares of our common stock on April 4, 2017. On January 29, 2020, we commenced the follow-on offering for up to 160,000,000 shares of our common stock. On September 30, 2016, the Adviser purchased 100 shares of our common stock at $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of combined upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Adviser will not tender these shares for repurchase as long as the Adviser remains our investment adviser. There is no current intention for the Adviser to discontinue in its role. On April 4, 2017, we received subscription agreements totaling $10.0 million for the purchase of shares of our common stock from a private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of those subscription agreements, the individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser agreed to pay for such shares of common stock upon demand by one of our executive officers. On April 4, 2017, we sold 277,778 shares pursuant to such subscription agreements and met the minimum offering requirement for our continuous public offering of $2.5 million. The purchase price of these shares sold in the private placement was $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees. In April 2017, we commenced operations and made our first portfolio company investment. Since meeting the minimum offering requirement and commencing our continuous public offering and through December 31, 2020, we have issued 143,313,940 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10.0 million in gross proceeds raised in the private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors. As of March 4, 2021, we have issued 147,640,991 shares of our common stock and have raised total gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10 million in gross proceeds raised from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\nOur Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Core Income Corp.\nThe Adviser is under common control with Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( ORTA\u201d), Owl Rock Capital Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), and Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC ( ORDA\u201d), which also are investment advisers and subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. ORTA serves as investment to Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and ORDA serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation III. The Adviser, ORTA, ORPFA and ORDA are referred to as the Owl Rock Advisers\u201d and together with Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\nIn addition, we and the Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker dealers to solicit capital. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOn December 23, 2020, Owl Rock Capital Group, the parent of the Adviser (and a subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners), and Dyal Capital Partners ( Dyal\u201d) announced they are merging to form Blue Owl Capital ( Blue Owl\u201d). Blue Owl will enter the public market via its acquisition by Altimar Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:ATAC) ( Altimar\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is consummated, there will be no changes to the Company's investment strategy or the Adviser's investment team or investment process with respect to the Company; however, the Transaction will result in a change in control of the Adviser, which will be deemed an assignment of the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. As a result, the Board, after considering the Transaction and subsequent change in control, has determined that upon consummation of the Transaction and subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held on March 17, 2021, the Company should enter into a third amended and restated investment advisory agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Board also determined that upon consummation of the Transaction, the Company should enter into an amended and restated administration agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Administration Agreement. See Item 1. Business - The Adviser and Administrator - Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates, have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including the Owl Rock Clients in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs, through December 31, 2020, we were permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain private funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and covered by our exemptive relief, even if such private funds have not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this order, private funds would generally not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us. Although the conditional exemptive order has expired, the SEC's Division of Investment Management has indicated that until March 31, 2021, it will not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing coinvestment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the conditional exemptive order, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The Owl Rock Advisors' allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other funds established by our Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of exemptive relief.\nOn February 28, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. For time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business.\nCertain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source of income limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset diversification requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOVID-19 Developments\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates, and in response to the outbreak, our Adviser instituted a work from home policy until it is deemed safe to return to the office.\nWe have and continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration in the United States and worldwide, the effectiveness of governmental responses designed to mitigate strain to businesses and the economy and the magnitude of the economic impact of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States are not allowed to visit Canada, Australia or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccines will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the United States and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nWe are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies and, by extension, our operating results to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and depending on the duration and extent of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, we expect that certain portfolio companies will experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. Some of our portfolio companies have significantly curtailed business operations, furloughed or laid off employees and terminated service providers and deferred capital expenditures, which could impair their business on a permanent basis and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar actions.\nWe have built out our portfolio management team to include workout experts and continue to closely monitor our portfolio companies, which includes assessing each portfolio company's operational and liquidity exposure and outlook. We have executed amendments to our loan documents which provide covenant modifications or additional liquidity, sometimes by allowing a portion of our loan to be paid in PIK rather than cash and in connection with these amendments we may receive increased economics. Any of these developments would likely result in a decrease in the value of our investment in any such portfolio company. In addition, to the extent that the impact to our portfolio companies results in reduced interest payments or permanent impairments on our investments, we could see a decrease in our net investment income which could result in an increase in the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to our debt obligations and could require us to reduce the future amount of distributions to our shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in originations, which reflects the lower levels of private equity deal activity in that time period; however, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an increase in originations compared to prior quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we expect the performance of our portfolio companies to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the related economic slowdown, and therefore, while we have highlighted our liquidity and available capital, we are focused on preserving that capital for our existing portfolio companies in order to protect the value of our investments.\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make loans to, and make debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle market companies. Our investment objective is to generate current income, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Since our Adviser and its affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2020, our Adviser and its affiliates have originated $27.7 billion aggregate principal amount of investments, of which $25.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S. middle market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans or originations of unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, investments in equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity.\nWe define middle market companies\u201d generally to mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA,\u201d between $10 million and $250 million annually and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment, although we may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an opportunity presents itself. We generally seek to invest in companies with a loan-to-value ratio of 50% or below.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates; however, we seek to invest not more than 20% of our portfolio in any single industry classification and target portfolio companies that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio).\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $18.6 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2020, excluding certain investments that fall outside our typical borrower profile, our portfolio companies representing 93.8% of our total portfolio based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $515 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $118 million.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2020, 97.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, performance based incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and performance based incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses\u201d for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of our stock);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of hedging;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> research and market data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fidelity bond, directors' and officers' errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of winding up;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification);

The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017, the date that the Company met the minimum offering requirement.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Adviser shall reimburse us for Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of our cumulative distributions paid to our shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds\u201d (as defined below) received by us on account of our investment portfolio during such quarter. Any payments required to be made by the Adviser pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as an Expense Payment\u201d.\nPursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Operating Expenses\u201d means all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. Available Operating Funds\u201d means the sum of (i) our estimated investment company taxable income (including realized net short-term capital gains reduced by realized net long-term capital losses), (ii) our realized net capital gains (including the excess of realized net long-term capital gains over realized net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies, if any (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above).\nThe Adviser's obligation to make an Expense Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Adviser and the right to such Expense Payment will be an asset of ours on the last business day of the applicable quarter. The Expense Payment for any quarter will be paid by the Adviser to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser no later than the earlier of (i) the date on which we close our books for such quarter, or (ii) forty-five days after the end of such quarter.\nFollowing any quarter in which Available Operating Funds exceed the cumulative distributions paid by us in respect of such quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds\u201d), we will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, in accordance with the stipulations below, as applicable, to the Adviser, until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by us are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment\u201d.\nThe amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in respect of such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The payment will be reduced to the extent that such Reimbursement Payments, together with all other Reimbursement Payments paid during the fiscal year, would cause Other Operating Expenses defined as our total Operating Expenses, excluding base management fees, incentive fees, organization and offering expenses, distribution and shareholder servicing fees, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses on an annualized basis and net of any Expense Payments received by us during the fiscal year to exceed the lesser of: (i) 1.75% of our average net assets attributable to the shares of our common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such Expense Payments into account; and (ii) the percentage of our average net assets attributable to shares of our common stock represented by Other Operating Expenses during the fiscal year in which such Expense Payment was made (provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any Reimbursement Payment which relates to an Expense Payment made during the same fiscal year).\nNo Reimbursement Payment for any quarter will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share\u201d (as defined below) declared by us at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) our Operating Expense Ratio\u201d (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share\u201d means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio\u201d is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to Adviser, and interest expense, by our net assets.\nThe specific amount of expenses reimbursed by the Adviser, if any, will be determined at the end of each quarter. We or the Adviser will be able to terminate the Expense Support Agreement at any time, with or without notice. The Expense Support Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of (a) the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, or (b) a determination by our Board to dissolve or liquidate the Company. Upon termination of the Expense Support Agreement, we will be required to fund any Expense Payments that have not been reimbursed by us to the Adviser. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of Expense Support payments provided by our Adviser since inception is $31.3 million.\nFee Waivers\nOn June 8, 2018, the Adviser agreed to waive (A) any portion of the management fee that was in excess of 1.50% of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash-equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement, (B) any portion of the incentive fee on net investment income that was in excess of 17.5% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, which was calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement but based on a quarterly preferred return of 1.50% per quarter and an upper level breakpoint of 1.818%, and (C) any portion of the incentive fee on capital gains that was in excess of 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, net of all realized capital losses and\nunrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, minus the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the Waiver\u201d). Any portion of the management fee, incentive fee on net investment income and incentive fee on capital gains waived is be subject to recoupment.\nOn February 19, 2020, our Board approved the Investment Advisory Agreement, which reduced the management fee and incentive fee to the amounts specified in the Waiver.\nReimbursement of Administrative Services\nWe will reimburse our Adviser for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. However, such reimbursement will be made at an amount equal to the lower of our Adviser's actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. Also, such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. We will not reimburse our Adviser for any services for which it receives a separate fee, for example rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Adviser.\nLeverage\nThe amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. Generally, our total borrowings are limited so that we cannot incur additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, if such additional indebtedness would cause our asset coverage ratio to fall below 200%, as defined in the 1940 Act; however, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it could incur. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if shareholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such shareholder approval, we would be permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if the required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the independent members of our Board approves such increase with such approval becoming effective after one year. In either case, we would be required to extend to our shareholders, as of the date of such approval, the opportunity to sell the shares of common stock that they hold and we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. For shareholders accepting such an offer, the Company would be required to repurchase 25% of such shareholders' eligible shares in each of the four calendar quarters following the calendar quarter in which the approval occurs. In addition, before incurring any such additional leverage, we would have to renegotiate or receive a waiver from the contractual leverage limitations under our existing credit facilities and notes. Our current target leverage ratio is 0.75x.\nIn any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns based on a combination of the following factors, which continue to remain true in the current environment, with the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 national health emergency:\nLimited Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. We believe that regulatory and structural changes in the market have reduced the amount of capital available to U.S. middle-market companies. In particular, we believe there are currently fewer providers of capital to middle market companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies.\nCapital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void in U.S. Middle Market Finance Left by Banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, middle market companies are less able to access these markets for reasons including the following:\nHigh Yield Market - Middle market companies generally are not issuing debt in an amount large enough to be an attractively sized bond. High yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors who, among other things, are focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETFs\u201d) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities' initial investment decision. Because there is typically little or no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide debt capital to U.S. middle market companies. We believe this is likely to be a persistent problem and creates an advantage for those like us who have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets.\nSyndicated Loan Market - While the syndicated loan market is modestly more accommodating to middle market issuers, as with bonds, loan issue size and liquidity are key drivers of institutional appetite and, correspondingly, underwriters' willingness to underwrite the loans. Loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts\u201d basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as flex\u201d, to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Furthermore, banks are generally reluctant to underwrite middle market loans because the arrangement fees they may earn on the placement of the debt generally are not sufficient to meet the banks' return hurdles. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex\u201d or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis.\nRobust Demand for Debt Capital. We believe U.S. middle market companies will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. In addition, we believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $1.5 trillion as of October 2020, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that private equity sponsors will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured loans provided by companies such as us.\nThe Middle Market is a Large Addressable Market. According to GE Capital's National Center for the Middle Market 4th quarter 2020 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle market companies, which have approximately 48 million aggregate employees. Moreover, the U.S. middle market accounts for one-third of private sector gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d). GE defines U.S. middle market companies as those between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of U.S. middle market companies.\nAttractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of middle market financings also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe BDC managers' expertise in credit selection and ability to manage through credit cycles has generally resulted in BDCs experiencing lower loss rates than U.S. commercial banks through credit cycles. Further, we believe that historical middle market default rates have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the larger market capitalization, broadly distributed market, leading to lower cumulative losses. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, as the economy reopens following the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 national health emergency, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as the economy reopens and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms.\nConservative Capital Structures. Following the credit crisis, which we define broadly as occurring between mid-2007 and mid-2009, lenders have generally required borrowers to maintain more equity as a percentage of their total capitalization, specifically to protect lenders during economic downturns. With more conservative capital structures, U.S. middle market companies have exhibited higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, U.S. middle market companies often are characterized by simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process.\nAttractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. Given the current low interest rate environment, we believe that debt issues with floating\ninterest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer's security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer's assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 74.8% first lien senior secured debt investments (of which 36% we consider to be unitranche debt investments (including last-out\u201d portions of such loans)), 22.8% second-lien senior secured debt investments, 0.3% unsecured investments and 2.1% equity investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 7.9% and 7.8%, respectively, and our weighted average yield of accruing debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 7.9%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had investments in 115 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $2.1 billion.\nBased on current market conditions, the pace of our investment activities may vary.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> ($

It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company's industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows:\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis.

For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments at Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments at Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 240,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,726,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,296,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,135,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,441,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in investments rated by our Adviser as a 3, 4 and 5 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 can be attributed to either COVID-19 related market disruptions or the underlying performance of the portfolio company.

Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table represents the operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income (Loss) Before Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Income taxes (benefit), including excise taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income (Loss) After Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,956\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,955\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income from investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nInvestment income increased to $142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $101.5 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our investment portfolio which, at par, increased from $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2019, to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in our portfolio's weighted average yield from 8.4% as of December 31, 2019 to 7.9% as of December 31, 2020. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. Period over period, income generated from these fees represented $3.9 million and $2.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition to the growth in the portfolio, the incremental increase in investment income was primarily due to an increase in dividend income earned from our investment in the Windows Entities of $3.4 million, that was not earned in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in investment income was partially driven by increased origination activity as a result of merger activity which has since leveled off. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nInvestment income increased to $101.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $34.2 million in prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio, at par, increased from $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, to $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. Period over period, income generated from these fees represented $2.6 million and $0.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance based incentive fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management and incentive fees waived\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (506\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,074\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,676\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,646\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recoupment of Expense Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet operating expenses increased to $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $52.6 million for the same period ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in interest expense and management fees, partially offset by an increase in expense support and decrease in performance based incentive fees. The increase in interest expense of $10.0 million was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to $646 million from $449 million period over period. The increase in management fees (gross of waivers) of $7.4 million is due to an increase in gross assets driven by an increase in investments. The decrease in performance based incentive fees (gross of waivers) of $4.3 million is due to a decrease in pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nNet operating expenses increased to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in interest expense and management fees. The increase in interest expense of $17.1 million was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to $449 million from $128 million period over period. The increase in management fees of $13.0 million is due to an increase in gross assets driven by an increase investments.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net tax expense of $714 thousand. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not record a net tax expense, for these subsidiaries. The income tax expense for our taxable consolidated subsidiaries will vary depending on the level of investment income earnings and realized gains from the exits of investments held by such taxable subsidiaries during the respective periods.\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses)\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized loss on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30,454\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,019\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,802\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (provision) benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,229\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,955\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net unrealized loss was primarily driven by a decrease in the fair value of our debt investments as compared to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 97.7% as compared to 98.2% as of December 31, 2019. The primary driver of our portfolio's net unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to current market conditions and credit spreads widening, the impact of which was primarily seen in the first quarter of 2020, but which has subsequently improved in the second, third and fourth quarters as the average fair value of the portfolio has improved. See COVID-19 Developments\u201d for additional information.\nThe ten largest contributors to the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change in Unrealized\nGain (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Windows Entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Norvax, LLC (dba GoHealth)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CD&R Smokey Buyer (fka Radio Systems)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining portfolio companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,144\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aviation Solutions Midco, LLC (dba STS Aviation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,464\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIBT Global, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment Benefits Group, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valence Surface Technologies LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,420\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LineStar Integrity Services LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,620\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EW Holdco, LLC (dba European Wax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,383\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,348\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gain was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt investments as compared to December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 98.2 % as compared to 97.9% as of December 31, 2018.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nThe realized gains and losses on fully exited and partially exited portfolio companies during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were comprised of the following:\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,840\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,956\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized losses on investments of $6.8 million, primarily driven by Swipe Acquisition Corporation, and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net realized gains on investments of $1.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net realized losses on foreign currency transactions of $116 thousand and $77 thousand, respectively, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not record a gain or loss on foreign currency transactions.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince we began investing in 2017 through December 31, 2020, our exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of over 11.6% (based on total capital invested of $392.0 million and total proceeds from these exited investments of $436.0 million). Over seventy percent of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return ( IRR\u201d) to us of 8% or greater.\nIRR is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our shareholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our shareholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of our common stock and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. The primary uses of our cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying or reimbursing our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nWe may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200% (or 150% if certain conditions are met). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our asset coverage ratios were 242% and 269%, respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200% (or 150% if certain conditions are met) asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash as of December 31, 2020 is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2020, we had $42.8 million in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $622.8 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $1.0 billion, partially offset by sell downs and repayments of portfolio investments of $320.6 million, and other operating activity of $70.4 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $592.5 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities of $340.4 million and proceeds from the issuance of shares of $345.9 million, partially offset by distributions paid of $49.3 million, debt issuance costs of $4.4 million and repurchased shares of $40.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $73.1 million in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $674.3 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $939.1 million, partially offset by sales of portfolio investments of $235.7 million, and other operating activity of $29.1 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $726.5 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities of $263.1 million and proceeds from the issuance of shares of $505.1 million, partially offset by distributions paid of $25.0 million, repurchased shares of $7.7 million and debt issuance costs of $8.9 million.\nNet Assets\nShare Issuances\nIn connection with our formation, we had the authority to issue 300,000,000 common shares at $0.01 per share par value. Effective as of June 18, 2019, we amended our charter to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue from 300,000,000 to 450,000,000. Pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-213716), we registered 264,000,000 common shares, par value of $0.01 per share, at an initial public offering price of $9.47 per share and pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-232183), we registered an additional 160,000,000 common shares, par value $0.01 per share, at an initial public offering price of $9.56 per share.\nOn September 30, 2016, we issued 100 common shares for $900 to the Adviser. We received $900 in cash from the Adviser on November 17, 2016.\nOn April 4, 2017, we received subscription agreements totaling $10 million for the purchase of shares of our common stock from a private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of those subscription agreements, the individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser agreed to pay for such shares of common stock upon demand by one of our executive officers. On April 4, 2017, we sold 277,778 shares pursuant to such subscription agreements and met the minimum offering requirement for our continuous public offering of $2.5 million. The purchase price of these shares sold in the private placement was $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nThe following table summarizes transactions with respect to shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands, except share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares/gross proceeds from the continuous public offering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,312,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,828,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 514,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,365,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 358,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinvestment of distributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,755,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,197,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 797,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchased Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,654,715\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,059\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (851,590\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,706\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (168,106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,527\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shares/gross proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,413,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 351,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,174,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 526,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,994,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales load\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,892\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,565\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,847\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shares/net proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,413,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 347,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,174,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 517,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,994,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 354,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the event of a material decline in our net asset value per share, which we consider to be a 2.5% decrease below its current net offering price, our Board will reduce the offering price in order to establish a new net offering price per share that is not more than 2.5% above the net asset value. We will not sell shares at a net offering price below the net asset value per share unless we obtain the requisite approval from our shareholders. To ensure that the offering price per share, net of sales load, is equal to or greater than net asset value per share on each subscription closing date and distribution reinvestment date, the Board increased the offering price per share of common stock on certain dates.

The regular weekly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of $0.012867 per share, will be payable monthly to shareholders of record as of the weekly record date.\nOn May 5, 2020, our Board declared regular weekly distributions for July 2020 through September 2020. The regular weekly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of $0.012867 per share, will be payable monthly to shareholders of record as of the weekly record date.\nOn September 23, 2020, our Board declared regular weekly distributions for October 2020 through December 2020. The regular weekly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of $0.011580 per share, will be payable monthly to shareholders of record as of the weekly record date.\nOn November 3, 2020, our Board declared regular weekly distributions for January 2021 through March 2021. The regular weekly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of $0.011580 per share, will be payable monthly to shareholders of record as of the weekly record date.\nOn February 23, 2021, our Board declared regular weekly distributions for April 2021 through June 2021. The regular weekly cash distributions, each in the gross amount of $0.011580 per share, will be payable monthly to shareholders of record as of the weekly record date.\nWith respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt-in\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted-in\u201d to the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically received in cash rather than reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nWe may fund our cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to us, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment. In no event, however, will funds be advanced or borrowed for purpose of distributions, if the amount of such distributions would exceed our accrued and received Net Revenues for the previous four quarters, less paid and accrued operating expenses with respect to such revenues and costs.\nThrough December 31, 2020, a portion of our distributions resulted from expense support from the Adviser, and future distributions may result from expense support from the Adviser, each of which is subject to repayment by us within three years from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement is to avoid distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distributions are not based on our investment performance, and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that our future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all.\nSources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, the Company may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares.\nWe intend to limit the number of shares to be repurchased in each quarter to the lesser of (a) 2.5% of the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding in the prior 12-month period and (b) the number of shares we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.\nAny periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td> Offer Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tender Offer Expiration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tender Offer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Purchase Price per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares Repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 12, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 6, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 21, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 18, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,321,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 17, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,628,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 19, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 17, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,619,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 4, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,207,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 13, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 10, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,039,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 19, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 16, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,085,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 18, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 16, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,984,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 396,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 9, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 3, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,398,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,462,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 26, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 22, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,280,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 600,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 24, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 21, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,493,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,797,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 16, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 14, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,153,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 794,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Return Since Inception\nCumulative total return for the period April 4, 2017 to December 31, 2020 was 29.6% (without upfront sales load) and 23.2% (with maximum upfront sales load).

Agreement (the SPV Asset Facility I\u201d). Parties to the SPV Asset Facility I include ORCC II Financing LLC and OR Lending II LLC, as Borrowers, and the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the SPV I Lenders\u201d), Goldman Sachs Bank USA as Sole Lead Arranger, Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company as Collateral Administrator and Collateral Agent and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC as Collateral Custodian. On July 31, 2018, the parties to the SPV Asset Facility I amended the SPV Asset Facility I and the related transaction documents (the SPV Facility I Amendment No. 1\u201d) to increase the maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility I, extend the reinvestment period and scheduled maturity of the SPV Asset Facility I, reduce the spread over LIBOR payable on the drawn amount of the SPV Asset Facility I and make certain other changes relating to the calculation of the borrowing base, the fees payable to Goldman Sachs Bank USA as Administrative Agent and the potential syndication of the SPV Asset Facility I. On March 11, 2019, the parties to the SPV Asset Facility I amended and restated the SPV Asset Facility I and the related transaction documents (the SPV Facility I Amendment No. 2\u201d) to establish and modify certain lender and Administration Agent consent rights, increase the maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility I and add new lenders. On April 29, 2019, the parties to the SPV Asset Facility I amended and restated the SPV Asset Facility I and the related transaction documents (the SPV Facility I Amendment No. 3\u201d) to increase the maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility I and make certain other changes, including dividing the loans under the SPV Asset Facility I into two separate Classes, Class A and Class B. The terms of the two classes of loans are generally the same, for example they have the same interest rate and maturity date but differ with respect to certain make-whole payments, minimum spread payments, unused commitment fees, consent rights and other terms.\nThe summary below reflects the terms of the SPV Asset Facility I as amended by SPV Facility I Amendment No. 1, SPV Facility I Amendment No. 2, SPV Facility I Amendment No. 3, and the voluntary commitment reduction that the Subsidiaries effected on May 8, 2020.\nFrom time to time, we sell and contribute certain investments to ORCC II Financing LLC pursuant to a Sale and Contribution Agreement by and between us and ORCC II Financing LLC. No gain or loss will be recognized as a result of these sales and contributions. Proceeds from the SPV Asset Facility I have been and will be used to finance the origination and acquisition of eligible assets by the Subsidiaries, including the purchase of such assets from us. We retain a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by the Subsidiaries through our ownership of the Subsidiaries. The maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility I is $400 million; the availability of this amount is subject to a borrowing base test, which is based on the amount of the Subsidiaries' assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including certain concentration limits\nThe SPV Asset Facility I provides for a reinvestment period up to and including November 30, 2021. (the SPV Asset Facility I Commitment Termination Date\u201d). Prior to the SPV Asset Facility I Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received by the Subsidiaries from interest, dividends, or fees on assets must be used to pay expenses and interest on outstanding borrowings, and the excess may be returned to the Company, subject to certain conditions. Proceeds received from principal on assets prior to the SPV Asset Facility I Commitment Termination Date must be used to make quarterly payments of principal on outstanding borrowings. Following the SPV Asset Facility I Commitment Termination Date, proceeds received by the Subsidiaries from interest and principal on collateral assets must be used to make quarterly payments of principal on outstanding borrowings. Subject to certain conditions, between quarterly payment dates prior to and after the SPV Asset Facility I Commitment Termination Date, excess interest proceeds and principal proceeds may be released to the Subsidiaries to make distributions to us.\nThe SPV Asset Facility I will mature on November 30, 2022. Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR plus a 2.25% spread and after a ramp-up period, the spread is also payable on any undrawn amounts. The Company borrows utilizing three-month LIBOR rate loans. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we will have to renegotiate the terms of the SPV Asset Facility I. The SPV Asset Facility I contains customary covenants, including certain financial maintenance covenants, limitations on the activities of the Subsidiaries, including limitations on incurrence of incremental indebtedness, and customary events of default. The SPV Asset Facility I is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in our equity interests in the Subsidiaries and in the assets of the Subsidiaries and on any payments received by the Subsidiaries in respect of those assets. Upon the occurrence of certain value adjustment events relating to the assets securing the SPV Asset Facility I, the Subsidiaries will also be required to provide certain cash collateral. Assets pledged to the SPV I Lenders will not be available to pay our debts.\nBorrowings of the Subsidiaries are considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.\nIn connection with the SPV Asset Facility I, we entered into a Non-Recourse Carveout Guaranty Agreement on the SPV Asset Facility I Closing Date, which was amended and restated twice on March 11, 2019 and April 29, 2019, with State Street Bank and Trust Company, on behalf of certain secured parties, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. Pursuant to the Non-Recourse Carveout Guaranty Agreement, we guarantee certain losses, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities, claims and other obligations incurred in connection with certain instances of fraud or bad faith misrepresentation, material encumbrances of certain collateral, misappropriation of certain funds, certain transfers of assets, and the bad faith or willful breach of certain provisions of the SPV Asset Facility I.\nSPV Asset Facility II\nOn April 14, 2020 (the SPV Asset Facility II Closing Date\u201d), ORCC II Financing II LLC ( ORCC II Financing II\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed subsidiary of us entered into a Credit Agreement (the SPV Asset Facility II\u201d), with ORCC II Financing II, as Borrower, the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the SPV II Lenders\u201d), Natixis, New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company as Collateral Agent and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC as Document Custodian. On October 30, 2020, the parties to the SPV Asset Facility II entered into an amendment agreement to increase the maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility II and make certain other changes (the SPV Facility II Amendment\u201d). The summary below reflects the terms of the SPV Asset Facility II as amended by the SPV Facility II Amendment.\nFrom time to time, we expect to sell and contribute certain investments to ORCC II Financing II pursuant to a Sale and Contribution Agreement by and between us and ORCC II Financing II. No gain or loss will be recognized as a result of these sales and contributions. Proceeds from the SPV Asset Facility II will be used to finance the origination and acquisition of eligible assets by ORCC II Financing II, including the purchase of such assets from us. We retain a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by ORCC II Financing II through our ownership of ORCC II Financing II. The maximum principal amount of the SPV Asset Facility II is $325 million; the availability of this amount is subject to an overcollateralization ratio test, which is based on the value of ORCC II Financing II's assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an interest coverage ratio test, certain concentration limits and collateral quality tests.\nThe SPV Asset Facility II provides for the ability to (1) draw term loans and (2) draw and redraw revolving loans under the SPV Asset Facility II for a period of up to two years after the SPV Asset Facility II Closing Date unless the revolving commitments are terminated or converted to term loans sooner as provided in the SPV Asset Facility II (the SPV Asset Facility II Commitment Termination Date\u201d). Unless otherwise terminated, the SPV Asset Facility II will mature on April 14, 2029 (the Stated Maturity\u201d). Prior to the Stated Maturity, proceeds received by ORCC II Financing II from principal and interest, dividends, or fees on assets must be used to pay fees, expenses and interest on outstanding borrowings, and the excess may be returned to us, subject to certain conditions. On the Stated Maturity, ORCC II Financing II must pay in full all outstanding fees and expenses and all principal and interest on outstanding borrowings, and the excess may be returned to us.\nAmounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR (or, in the case of certain lenders that are commercial paper conduits, the lower of their cost of funds and LIBOR plus 0.25%) plus, (x) with respect to revolving loans, 2.75% and (y) with respect to term loans, 2.45% during the SPV Asset Facility II's reinvestment period and 2.70% thereafter. From the SPV Asset Facility II Closing Date to the SPV Asset Facility II Commitment Termination Date, there is a commitment fee that steps up during the year after the SPV Closing Date from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum on the undrawn amount, if any, of the revolving commitments in the SPV Asset Facility II. The SPV Asset Facility II contains customary covenants, including certain financial maintenance covenants, limitations on the activities of ORCC II Financing II, including limitations on incurrence of incremental indebtedness, and customary events of default. The SPV Asset Facility II is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the assets of ORCC II Financing II and on any payments received by ORCC II Financing II in respect of those assets. Assets pledged to the SPV II Lenders will not be available to pay the debts of the Company.\nBorrowings of ORCC II Financing II are considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.\nPromissory Note\nOn May 18, 2017, our Board authorized us, as borrower, to enter into a series of promissory notes (the Promissory Notes\u201d) with our Adviser, as lender, to borrow up to an aggregate of $10 million from our Adviser. On October 19, 2017, our Board increased the approved amount to an aggregate of $15 million. On November 7, 2017, our Board approved a further modification to the Promissory Notes which extended the original maturity date from January 15, 2018 to December 31, 2018.

We may re-borrow any amount repaid; however, there is no funding commitment between the Adviser and us.\nThe interest rate on any such borrowing may be based on either the rate of interest for a LIBOR-Based Advance or the rate of interest for a Prime-Based Advance under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2017, as amended as of August 1, 2017 (as further amended or supplemented from time to time, the Loan Agreement\u201d), by and among the Lender, as borrower, and East West Bank.\nThe unpaid principal balance of the Promissory Notes and accrued interest thereon was paid in full on December 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Borrowed funds were used to leverage our investment portfolio and to make investments in portfolio companies consistent with our investment strategies.\n2024 Notes\nOn November 26, 2019, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% notes due November 26, 2024 (the Existing 2024 Notes\u201d) in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and for initial resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act.\nOn October 21, 2020, we issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% note due 2024 (the Additional 2024 Notes\u201d and together with the Existing 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes\u201d) in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and for initial resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act. The Additional 2024 Notes will be treated as a single series with the Existing 2024 Notes and will have the same terms as the Existing 2024 Notes.\nThe 2024 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration.\nThe 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 26, 2019 (the Base Indenture\u201d), between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d), and a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 26, 2019 (the First Supplemental Indenture\u201d and together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture\u201d), between us and the Trustee. The 2024 Notes will mature on November 26, 2024, unless repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.625% per year payable semi-annually on May 26 and November 26 of each year, commencing on May 26, 2020. The 2024 Notes will be our direct, general unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our future indebtedness or other obligations that are expressly subordinated, or junior, in right of payment to the 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes will rank pari passu, or equal, in right of payment with all of our existing and future indebtedness or other obligations that are not so subordinated. The 2024 Notes will rank effectively subordinated, or junior, to any of our future secured indebtedness or other obligations (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2024 Notes will rank structurally subordinated, or junior, to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, whether or not it is subject to those requirements, and (ii) provide financial information to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the Trustee if we are no longer subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.\nIn addition, if a change of control repurchase event, as defined in the Indenture, occurs prior to maturity, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase for cash some or all of the 2024 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments.

See ITEM 8. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d for further details.\nOur Board has authorized us to enter into a series of Promissory Notes with our Adviser to borrow up to $50 million. The Promissory Notes matured on December 31, 2020. See ITEM 8. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note. 6 Debt\u201d for further details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our audit committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser's valuation committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser's valuation committee. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations and recommends values for each investment to the Board; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and\nmay be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nRule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was recently adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts or premiums. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK interest represents accrued interest that is added to the principal amount of the investment on the respective interest payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nDistributions\nWe have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distributions for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay monthly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWith respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt-in\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted-in\u201d to the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically received in cash rather than reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017, and intend to continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nTo qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us to not be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. excise tax on this income.\nCertain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The 2017 through 2019 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities.", "summary": "The report provides information about Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (BDC\u201d).

The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. On March 15, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC originates loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe are managed by our Adviser. Our Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\"). Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services, to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain organizational activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. Our Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of management professionals. Our Board consists of eight directors, five of whom are independent.\nWe commenced a continuous public offering for up to 264,000,000 shares of our common stock on April 4, 2017. On January 29, 2020, we commenced the follow-on offering for up to 160,000,000 shares of our common stock. On September 30, 2016, the Adviser purchased 100 shares of our common stock at $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of combined upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Adviser will not tender these shares for repurchase as long as the Adviser remains our investment adviser. There is no current intention for the Adviser to discontinue in its role. On April 4, 2017, we received subscription agreements totaling $10.0 million for the purchase of shares of our common stock from a private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of those subscription agreements, the individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser agreed to pay for such shares of common stock upon demand by one of our executive officers. On April 4, 2017, we sold 277,778 shares pursuant to such subscription agreements and met the minimum offering requirement for our continuous public offering of $2.5 million. The purchase price of these shares sold in the private placement was $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees. In April 2017, we commenced operations and made our first portfolio company investment. Since meeting the minimum offering requirement and commencing our continuous public offering and through December 31, 2020, we have issued 143,313,940 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10.0 million in gross proceeds raised in the private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors. As of March 4, 2021, we have issued 147,640,991 shares of our common stock and have raised total gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10 million in gross proceeds raised from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\nOur Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Core Income Corp.\nThe Adviser is under common control with Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( ORTA\u201d), Owl Rock Capital Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), and Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC ( ORDA\u201d), which also are investment advisers and subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. ORTA serves as investment to Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and ORDA serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation III. The Adviser, ORTA, ORPFA and ORDA are referred to as the Owl Rock Advisers\u201d and together with Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\nIn addition, we and the Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker dealers to solicit capital. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOn December 23, 2020, Owl Rock Capital Group, the parent of the Adviser (and a subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners), and Dyal Capital Partners ( Dyal\u201d) announced they are merging to form Blue Owl Capital ( Blue Owl\u201d). Blue Owl will enter the public market via its acquisition by Altimar Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:ATAC) ( Altimar\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is consummated, there will be no changes to the Company's investment strategy or the Adviser's investment team or investment process with respect to the Company; however, the Transaction will result in a change in control of the Adviser, which will be deemed an assignment of the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. As a result, the Board, after considering the Transaction and subsequent change in control, has determined that upon consummation of the Transaction and subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held on March 17, 2021, the Company should enter into a third amended and restated investment advisory agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Board also determined that upon consummation of the Transaction, the Company should enter into an amended and restated administration agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Administration Agreement. See Item 1. Business - The Adviser and Administrator - Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates, have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including the Owl Rock Clients in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs, through December 31, 2020, we were permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain private funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and covered by our exemptive relief, even if such private funds have not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this order, private funds would generally not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us. Although the conditional exemptive order has expired, the SEC's Division of Investment Management has indicated that until March 31, 2021, it will not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing coinvestment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the conditional exemptive order, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The Owl Rock Advisors' allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other funds established by our Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of exemptive relief.\nOn February 28, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. For time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business.\nCertain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nCOVID-19 Developments\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates, and in response to the outbreak, our Adviser instituted a work from home policy until it is deemed safe to return to the office.\nWe have and continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration in the United States and worldwide, the effectiveness of governmental responses designed to mitigate strain to businesses and the economy and the magnitude of the economic impact of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States are not allowed to visit Canada, Australia or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccines will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the United States and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nWe are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies and, by extension, our operating results to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and depending on the duration and extent of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, we expect that certain portfolio companies will experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. Some of our portfolio companies have significantly curtailed business operations, furloughed or laid off employees and terminated service providers and deferred capital expenditures, which could impair their business on a permanent basis and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar actions.\nWe have built out our portfolio management team to include workout experts and continue to closely monitor our portfolio companies, which includes assessing each portfolio company's operational and liquidity exposure and outlook. We have executed amendments to our loan documents which provide covenant modifications or additional liquidity, sometimes by allowing a portion of our loan to be paid in PIK rather than cash and in connection with these amendments we may receive increased economics. Any of these developments would likely result in a decrease in the value of our investment in any such portfolio company. In addition, to the extent that the impact to our portfolio companies results in reduced interest payments or permanent impairments on our investments, we could see a decrease in our net investment income which could result in an increase in the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to our debt obligations and could require us to reduce the future amount of distributions to our shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in originations, which reflects the lower levels of private equity deal activity in that time period; however, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an increase in originations compared to prior quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we expect the performance of our portfolio companies to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the related economic slowdown, and therefore, while we have highlighted our liquidity and available capital, we are focused on preserving that capital for our existing portfolio companies in order to protect the value of our investments.\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make loans to, and make debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle market companies. Our investment objective is to generate current income, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Since our Adviser and its affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2020, our Adviser and its affiliates have originated $27.7 billion aggregate principal amount of investments, of which $25.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S. middle market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans or originations of unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, investments in equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity.\nWe define middle market companies\u201d generally to mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA,\u201d between $10 million and $250 million annually and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment, although we may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an opportunity presents itself. We generally seek to invest in companies with a loan-to-value ratio of 50% or below.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates; however, we seek to invest not more than 20% of our portfolio in any single industry classification and target portfolio companies that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio).\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $18.6 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2020, excluding certain investments that fall outside our typical borrower profile, our portfolio companies representing 93.8% of our total portfolio based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $515 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $118 million.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2020, 97.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, performance based incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and performance based incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\n \u2022 expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses\u201d for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of our stock); \n \u2022 the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of our common stock; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); \n \u2022 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 research and market data; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors' and officers' errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; \n \u2022 costs of winding up; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; \n \u2022 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and \n \u2022 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. \nWe expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods.\nExpense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement\nWe have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement\u201d) with the Adviser, the purpose of which is to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017, the date that the Company met the minimum offering requirement.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Adviser shall reimburse us for Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of our cumulative distributions paid to our shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds\u201d (as defined below) received by us on account of our investment portfolio during such quarter. Any payments required to be made by the Adviser pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as an Expense Payment\u201d.\nPursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Operating Expenses\u201d means all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Owl Rock Capital Corporation II and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOwl Rock Capital Corporation II (the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, or our\u201d) is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Maryland corporation on October 15, 2015, we are externally managed by Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC (the Adviser\u201d) which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d). We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. On March 15, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC originates loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe are managed by our Adviser. Our Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\"). Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services, to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain organizational activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. Our Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of management professionals. Our Board consists of eight directors, five of whom are independent.\nWe commenced a continuous public offering for up to 264,000,000 shares of our common stock on April 4, 2017. On January 29, 2020, we commenced the follow-on offering for up to 160,000,000 shares of our common stock. On September 30, 2016, the Adviser purchased 100 shares of our common stock at $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of combined upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Adviser will not tender these shares for repurchase as long as the Adviser remains our investment adviser. There is no current intention for the Adviser to discontinue in its role. On April 4, 2017, we received subscription agreements totaling $10.0 million for the purchase of shares of our common stock from a private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of those subscription agreements, the individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser agreed to pay for such shares of common stock upon demand by one of our executive officers. On April 4, 2017, we sold 277,778 shares pursuant to such subscription agreements and met the minimum offering requirement for our continuous public offering of $2.5 million. The purchase price of these shares sold in the private placement was $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $9.47 per share, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees. In April 2017, we commenced operations and made our first portfolio company investment. Since meeting the minimum offering requirement and commencing our continuous public offering and through December 31, 2020, we have issued 143,313,940 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10.0 million in gross proceeds raised in the private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors. As of March 4, 2021, we have issued 147,640,991 shares of our common stock and have raised total gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately $10 million in gross proceeds raised from certain individuals and entities affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\nOur Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Core Income Corp.\nThe Adviser is under common control with Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( ORTA\u201d), Owl Rock Capital Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), and Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC ( ORDA\u201d), which also are investment advisers and subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. ORTA serves as investment to Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and ORDA serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation III. The Adviser, ORTA, ORPFA and ORDA are referred to as the Owl Rock Advisers\u201d and together with Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\nIn addition, we and the Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker dealers to solicit capital. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOn December 23, 2020, Owl Rock Capital Group, the parent of the Adviser (and a subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners), and Dyal Capital Partners ( Dyal\u201d) announced they are merging to form Blue Owl Capital ( Blue Owl\u201d). Blue Owl will enter the public market via its acquisition by Altimar Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:ATAC) ( Altimar\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is consummated, there will be no changes to the Company's investment strategy or the Adviser's investment team or investment process with respect to the Company; however, the Transaction will result in a change in control of the Adviser, which will be deemed an assignment of the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. As a result, the Board, after considering the Transaction and subsequent change in control, has determined that upon consummation of the Transaction and subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held on March 17, 2021, the Company should enter into a third amended and restated investment advisory agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Board also determined that upon consummation of the Transaction, the Company should enter into an amended and restated administration agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Administration Agreement. See Item 1. Business - The Adviser and Administrator - Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates, have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including the Owl Rock Clients in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs, through December 31, 2020, we were permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain private funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and covered by our exemptive relief, even if such private funds have not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this order, private funds would generally not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us. Although the conditional exemptive order has expired, the SEC's Division of Investment Management has indicated that until March 31, 2021, it will not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing coinvestment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the conditional exemptive order, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The Owl Rock Advisors' allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other funds established by our Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of exemptive relief.\nOn February 28, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. For time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business.\nCertain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nCOVID-19 Developments\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to such outbreak. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which the Company operates, and in response to the outbreak, our Adviser instituted a work from home policy until it is deemed safe to return to the office.\nWe have and continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration in the United States and worldwide, the effectiveness of governmental responses designed to mitigate strain to businesses and the economy and the magnitude of the economic impact of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, cancellations of events and travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, have relaxed initial public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases have led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Additionally, as of late December 2020, travelers from the United States are not allowed to visit Canada, Australia or the majority of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. These continued travel restrictions may prolong the global economic downturn. In addition, although the Federal Food and Drug Administration authorized vaccines for emergency use starting in December 2020, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccines will be distributed nationwide and globally or when herd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. The delay in distributing the vaccines could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the United States and other major markets. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn.\nWe are unable to predict the duration of any business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect our portfolio companies' operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen, we expect our portfolio companies and, by extension, our operating results to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and depending on the duration and extent of the disruption to the operations of our portfolio companies, we expect that certain portfolio companies will experience financial distress and possibly default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. Some of our portfolio companies have significantly curtailed business operations, furloughed or laid off employees and terminated service providers and deferred capital expenditures, which could impair their business on a permanent basis and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar actions.\nWe have built out our portfolio management team to include workout experts and continue to closely monitor our portfolio companies, which includes assessing each portfolio company's operational and liquidity exposure and outlook. We have executed amendments to our loan documents which provide covenant modifications or additional liquidity, sometimes by allowing a portion of our loan to be paid in PIK rather than cash and in connection with these amendments we may receive increased economics. Any of these developments would likely result in a decrease in the value of our investment in any such portfolio company. In addition, to the extent that the impact to our portfolio companies results in reduced interest payments or permanent impairments on our investments, we could see a decrease in our net investment income which could result in an increase in the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to our debt obligations and could require us to reduce the future amount of distributions to our shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a decrease in originations, which reflects the lower levels of private equity deal activity in that time period; however, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an increase in originations compared to prior quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we expect the performance of our portfolio companies to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the related economic slowdown, and therefore, while we have highlighted our liquidity and available capital, we are focused on preserving that capital for our existing portfolio companies in order to protect the value of our investments.\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make loans to, and make debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle market companies. Our investment objective is to generate current income, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Since our Adviser and its affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2020, our Adviser and its affiliates have originated $27.7 billion aggregate principal amount of investments, of which $25.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S. middle market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans or originations of unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, investments in equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity.\nWe define middle market companies\u201d generally to mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA,\u201d between $10 million and $250 million annually and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment, although we may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an opportunity presents itself. We generally seek to invest in companies with a loan-to-value ratio of 50% or below.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates; however, we seek to invest not more than 20% of our portfolio in any single industry classification and target portfolio companies that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio).\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $18.6 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2020, excluding certain investments that fall outside our typical borrower profile, our portfolio companies representing 93.8% of our total portfolio based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $515 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $118 million.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2020, 97.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, performance based incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and performance based incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\n \u2022 expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses\u201d for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of our stock); \n \u2022 the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of our common stock; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); \n \u2022 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 research and market data; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors' and officers' errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; \n \u2022 costs of winding up; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; \n \u2022 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and \n \u2022 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. \nWe expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods.\nExpense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement\nWe have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement\u201d) with the Adviser, the purpose of which is to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017, the date that the Company met the minimum offering requirement.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Adviser shall reimburse us for Operating Expenses\u201d (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of our cumulative distributions paid to our shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds\u201d (as defined below) received by us on account of our investment portfolio during such quarter. Any payments required to be made by the Adviser pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as an Expense Payment\u201d.\nPursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Operating Expenses\u201d means all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance"}
