Risk Factors\u201d for information regarding certain risks inherent in our business.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and the audited financial statements of our Predecessor and Enviva Pellets Cottondale, LLC ( Cottondale\u201d). On April 9, 2015, we, the Predecessor and our sponsor executed a series of transactions that were accounted for as common control transactions (the Reorganization\u201d). On April 9, 2015, our sponsor contributed some, but not all, of our Predecessor's assets and liabilities to us. Specifically, our sponsor's interest in Enviva Pellets Southampton, LLC ( Southampton\u201d) was excluded from the April 9, 2015 contribution as it was conveyed to the First Hancock JV, a consolidated entity of the sponsor, on April 9, 2015. Our sponsor contributed its interest in Cottondale, which owns a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the Cottondale plant\u201d), to us on April 9, 2015.\nOn December 11, 2015, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Southampton together with an off-take contract and a related third-party shipping contract for total consideration of $131.0 million pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Southampton Drop-Down\u201d).\nOn December 14, 2016, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC ( Sampson\u201d) for total consideration of $175.0 million (the Sampson Drop-Down\u201d). The Sampson Drop-Down also included two off-take contracts and related third-party shipping contracts.\nOn October 2, 2017, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC ( Wilmington\u201d) for total consideration of $130.0 million (the Wilmington Drop-Down\u201d).\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our initial public offering ( the IPO\u201d) include the results of our Predecessor and its subsidiaries and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to our Predecessor after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements for the period after the IPO pertain to our operations. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in our Predecessor and Enviva GP, LLC as if the contributions had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, the contribution of Enviva Cottondale Acquisition II, LLC ( Acquisition II\u201d) as if the contribution had occurred on January 5, 2015, which is the date on which our sponsor\nacquired Green Circle Bio Energy, Inc. ( Green Circle\u201d), which owned the Cottondale plant, the Southampton Drop-Down as if it occurred on April 9, 2015, the date Southampton was originally conveyed to the First Hancock JV and the Sampson Drop-Down and the Wilmington Drop-Down as if they had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson and Wilmington were originally organized. Entities contributed by or distributed to our sponsor or the First Hancock JV are considered entities under common control and are recorded at historical cost.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.9 million MTPY. We also own dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal assets at the Port of Chesapeake (the Chesapeake terminal\u201d) and the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina (the Wilmington terminal\u201d). All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective. For a more complete description of our business, please read Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOur sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the Partnership. During 2017, contracted volumes under our existing off-take contracts are approximately equal to the full production capacity of our production plants.\nOur off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.9 million metric tons ( MT\u201d) of wood pellets in 2018 and have a weighted-average remaining term of 9.5 years from February 15, 2018. We intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for our product that is driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants to co-fired or dedicated biomass-fired plants, principally in Europe and, increasingly, in South Korea and Japan.\nRecent Developments\nWilmington Drop-Down\nOn October 2, 2017, pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Wilmington Contribution Agreement\u201d), the First Hancock JV sold to the Partnership all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Wilmington, which owns the Wilmington terminal.\nThe purchase price for Wilmington was $130.0 million, which included an initial payment of $54.6 million, net of an approximate purchase price adjustment of $1.4 million. The initial payment was funded with borrowings from revolving credit commitments and cash on hand. We accounted for the Wilmington Drop-Down as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the acquisition were retrospectively recast to reflect the acquisition as if it had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized.\nThe Wilmington terminal, which is capable of receiving product by rail and truck, has the capacity to store up to 90,000 MT of wood pellets, and load up to Panamax-sized vessels. It utilizes state-of-the-art handling equipment and storage infrastructure designed to maintain product quality and safety with throughput capacity of up to 3.0 million MTPY of wood pellets.\nWilmington will handle up to approximately 600,000 MTPY of throughput from the Sampson plant and is party to a long-term terminal services agreement with Enviva Pellets Greenwood, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Second Hancock JV ( Greenwood\u201d). Wilmington will handle throughput volumes sourced from Greenwood's wood pellet production plant located in Greenwood, South Carolina (the Greenwood plant\u201d). The terminal services agreement with Greenwood provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met.\nIn addition, the Wilmington Contribution Agreement contemplates that Wilmington will enter into a long-term terminal services agreement (the Wilmington Hamlet TSA\u201d) with the First Hancock JV and Enviva Pellets Hamlet, LLC ( Hamlet\u201d) to receive, store and load wood pellets from the First Hancock JV's proposed production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the Hamlet plant\u201d) when the First Hancock JV completes construction of the Hamlet plant. The Wilmington Hamlet TSA also provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met. Pursuant to the Wilmington Contribution Agreement, following notice of the anticipated first delivery of wood pellets to the Wilmington terminal from the Hamlet plant, Wilmington, Hamlet, and the First Hancock JV would enter into the Wilmington Hamlet TSA and the Partnership would make a final payment of $74.0 million in cash or common units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership ( common units\u201d) to the First Hancock JV, subject to certain conditions, as deferred consideration for the Wilmington Drop-Down.\nWilmington also entered into a throughput option agreement with the sponsor granting the sponsor, subject to certain conditions, the option to obtain terminal services at the Wilmington terminal at marginal cost throughput rates for wood pellets produced by one of the sponsor's potential wood pellet production plants.\nSenior Notes Due 2021\nOn November 1, 2016, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2021 (the Senior Notes\u201d) to eligible purchasers in a private placement transaction. In August 2017, holders of 100% of the Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nOn October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at a price of 106.25% of par plus accrued interest from May 1, 2017. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The net proceeds were used to repay the borrowings on our revolving credit facility that were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer). The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the outstanding Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nSale of the Wiggins Plant\nIn December 2016, we initiated a plan to sell our 110,000 MTPY production plant located in Wiggins, Mississippi and related assets (the Wiggins plant\u201d). We sold the Wiggins plant to a third-party buyer for a purchase price of $0.4 million on December 27, 2017, and on December 28, 2017, Enviva Pellets Wiggins, LLC ( Wiggins\u201d), the owner of the Wiggins plant, was dissolved. We recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8 million, net, upon deconsolidation.\nAt-the-Market Offering Program\nOn August 8, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Act Commission ( SEC\u201d) on June 24, 2016, for the continuous offering of up to $100.0 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. In August 2016, we also entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with certain managers pursuant to which we may offer and sell common units from time to time through or to one or more of the managers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement, of up to an aggregate sales amount of $100.0 million (the ATM Program\u201d).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold 71,368 and 358,593, respectively, under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.9 million, net of an insignificant amount of commissions, during 2017, and net proceeds of $9.3 million, net of $0.1 million of commissions, during 2016. Accounting and other fees of approximately $0.2 million were offset against the proceeds during 2017. Deferred issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million, primarily consisting of legal, accounting and other fees, were offset against the proceeds during 2016. Net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program were used for general partnership purposes. As of February 16, 2018, $88.6 million of common units remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nAdjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\nWe use adjusted gross margin per metric ton to measure our financial performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding asset disposals and depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe view adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of our financial performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs, debt premium and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Please read Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of each of adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFactors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations and cash flows, principally for the following reasons:\nOur sponsor contributed its interest in Wilmington to us on October 2, 2017. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Wilmington as if the contribution had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized. The recast amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily include general and administrative expenses associated with terminal development costs incurred during the construction of the Wilmington terminal. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the terminal began operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. The amount paid in excess of historical cost is recorded as a deemed dividend to the General Partner.\nWe increased our production capacity with the Sampson Drop-Down and began deliveries under a new long-term off-take contract in December 2016. In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, the First Hancock JV assigned to us a ten-year, take-or-pay off-take contract with \u00d8rsted (the \u00d8rsted Contract\u201d). The \u00d8rsted Contract commenced on September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an amendment to the \u00d8rsted Contract for the supply of an incremental 200,000 MT from late 2018 through mid-2021. \u00d8rsted's obligations under the \u00d8rsted Contract are guaranteed by its parent, \u00d8rsted A/S. The \u00d8rsted Contract, accompanied by our increased production capacity from the Sampson plant, will have a material effect on our product sales and resulting gross margin.\nWe issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On November 1, 2016, we and Enviva Partners Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership formed on October 3, 2016 for the purpose of being the co-issuer of the notes, issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand and the issuance of 1,098,415 unregistered common units at a value of $27.31 per unit, or $30.0 million of common units, to affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), funded the consideration payable for the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering was used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, our consolidated financial statements reflect the outstanding debt and interest expense associated with the Senior Notes.\nWe issued $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nThe sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million, after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down, and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nWe repaid a portion of the Original Credit Facilities and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility. On April 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for a $199.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities (the Original Credit Facilities\u201d). We entered into an\nassumption agreement on December 11, 2015, providing for $36.5 million of incremental term loan borrowings (the Incremental Term Borrowings\u201d and, together with the Original Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) under the Credit Agreement. In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d), which became effective upon the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down. Upon the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, was used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-2 and Tranche A-4 borrowings and to repay a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-1 and Tranche A-3 borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Following the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down and repayment of a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the limit under our revolving credit commitments was increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million pursuant to the Second Amendment.\nRevenue and costs for deliveries to customers can vary significantly between periods depending upon the mix of customers and specific shipment and reimbursement for expenses, including the then-current cost of fuel. Depending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either Cost, Insurance and Freight ( CIF\u201d), Cost and Freight ( CFR\u201d) or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. We have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOverview\nWe primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under off-take contracts, the majority of the commitments under which are long term in nature. We refer to the structure of our contracts as take-or-pay\u201d because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in case a customer fails to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or terminates the contract. Each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell, the fixed price per MT for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications. These prices are fixed for the entire term, subject to annual inflation-based adjustments and price escalators, as well as, in some instances, price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs. In addition to sales of our product under these long-term, take-or-pay contracts, we routinely sell wood pellets under shorter-term contracts, which range in volume and tenor and, in some cases, may include only one specific shipment. Because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement, our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends. Our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the customer, the sales price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDepending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either CIF, CFR or FOB. Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognized between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin.\nThe majority of the wood pellets we supply to our customers is produced at our production plants, the sales of which are included in Product Sales.\u201d We also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by purchasing from and selling to third-party market participants, including, in some\ncases, our customers. In these back-to-back transactions where title and risk of loss are immediately transferred to the ultimate purchaser, revenue is recorded net of costs paid to the third-party supplier. This revenue is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nIn some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer, or accelerate a shipment. Contractually, we will seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, including in some cases a related party, either within our contracted off-take portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nContracted Backlog\nAs of February 15, 2018, we had approximately $5.8 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to power generators compared to approximately $5.7 billion as of February 1, 2017. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2018 forward rates. Please read Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Derivative Instruments\u201d for more information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts.\nOur expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 15, 2018 is as follows (in millions):\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod from February 15, 2018 to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ending December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ending December 31, 2020 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,691\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal product sales contracted backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,796\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers. The principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material, production and distribution costs.\nWe have strategically located our plants in the Southeastern United States, a region with plentiful wood fiber resources. We manage the supply of raw materials into our plants through a mixture of short-term and long-term contracts. Delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage as well as harvesting, transportation and, in some cases, size reduction services provided by our suppliers. The majority of our product volumes are sold under off-take contracts that include cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs.\nProduction costs at our production plants consist of labor, energy, tooling, repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs. Production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment and any gain or loss on disposal of associated assets. Some of our off-take contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs. In addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants, we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from our sponsor and third-party wood pellet producers.\nDistribution costs include all transportation costs from our plants to our port locations, any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers. Both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our deep-water terminals have allowed for the efficient and cost-effective transportation of our wood pellets. We seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into long-term, fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our off-take contracts pursuant to which we are responsible for arranging shipping. Certain of our off-take contracts include\npricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices, which allow us to pass the majority of the fuel price risk associated with shipping through to our customers.\nAdditionally, as deliveries are made, we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangible assets during the applicable contract term.\nRaw material, production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our owned and leased marine terminals and related- and third-party wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory. Fixed production overhead, including the related depreciation expense, is allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the facilities. These costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold. Distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable acquired customer contracts are expensed as incurred. Our inventory is recorded using the first-in, first-out method ( FIFO\u201d), which requires the use of judgment and estimates. Given the nature of our inventory, the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the FIFO inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe and our General Partner are party to a Management Services Agreement (the MSA\u201d) with Enviva Management. Under the MSA, direct or indirect internal or third-party expenses incurred are either directly identifiable or allocated to us. Enviva Management estimates the percentage of employee salaries and related benefits, third-party costs, office rent and expenses and any other overhead costs to be provided to us. Each month, Enviva Management allocates the actual costs accumulated in the financial accounting system using these estimates. Enviva Management also charges us for any directly identifiable costs such as goods or services provided at our request. We believe Enviva Management's assumptions and allocations have been made on a reasonable basis and are the best estimate of the costs that we would have incurred on a stand-alone basis.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Wilmington as if the contribution had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized. We do not develop plants or ports within the Partnership and therefore we do not incur startup and commissioning costs or overhead costs related to construction activities. Prior to the consummation of the Wilmington Drop-Down, Wilmington incurred general and administrative costs related to development activities which included startup and commissioning activities prior to beginning production as well as incremental overhead costs related to construction activities. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n522,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n444,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n77,761\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,184\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n543,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n464,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,945\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n419,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n357,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62,198\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,513\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,204\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n464,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n387,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,915\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,030\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,991)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDisposal and impairment of assets held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9,164)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12,155)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,185\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,744)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,643)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,101)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRelated-party interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(578)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarly retirement of debt obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,438)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,438\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (expense) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,751)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,190)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess net loss attributable to noncontrolling partners' interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,664)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to Enviva Partners, LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,754)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(1) See Part II, Item 8.

The $77.8 million increase was largely attributable to greater sales volumes, primarily relating to tons sold under the contract acquired in connection with the Sampson Drop-Down. In 2017, we sold 2,724,000 MT of wood pellets compared to 2,346,000 in 2016, a 16% increase.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in related-party terminal services as a result of the Wilmington Drop-Down. Other revenue includes sales of wood pellets sourced from third-party pellet producers and delivered to our customers. In these back-to-back transactions, title and risk of loss immediately transfers to the ultimate purchasers; accordingly, such transactions are presented on a net basis. Other revenue also includes revenue derived from terminal services.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold increased to $464.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $387.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $76.9 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes and depreciation expense. In 2017, there was approximately $12.6 million of incremental depreciation expense, related to machinery and equipment at the Sampson plant and Wilmington terminal.\nLoss on disposal of assets\nWe incurred $4.9 million and $2.4 million of expense associated with the disposal of assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was primarily attributable to the disposal of assets replaced in connection with growth and maintenance capital projects at two of our plants.\nGross margin\nWe earned gross margin of $78.8 million and $76.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The gross margin increase of $2.0 million was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA $14.2 million increase in gross margin due to higher sales volumes.

The factors impacting adjusted gross margin are detailed above under the heading Gross margin.\u201d\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses included allocated expenses of $14.6 million that were incurred under the MSA, $0.2 million related to development activities prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down, $6.7 million of direct expenses, $5.0 million of non-cash unit compensation expense associated with unit-based awards and $3.5 million related to acquisition transaction expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $14.2 million under the MSA, $2.4 million and $7.0 million related to development activities prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down and the Sampson Drop-Down, respectively, $4.5 million of direct expenses, $4.2 million of non-cash unit compensation expense associated with unit-based awards, and $0.8 million of expenses related to acquisition transaction expenses.\nDisposal and impairment of assets held for sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8 million, net, upon deconsolidation of the Wiggins plant. For more information, please read -Recent Developments-Sale of Wiggins Plant\u201d above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a $10.0 million non-cash impairment charge related to the sale of the Wiggins plant.\nInterest expense\nWe incurred $31.7 million of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $15.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to our increase in long-term debt outstanding. Please read -Senior Notes Due 2021\u201d below.\nRelated-party interest expense\nOn December 11, 2015, under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we obtained incremental borrowings in the amount of $36.5 million and Enviva FiberCo, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor ( FiberCo\u201d), became a lender with the purchase of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of the incremental borrowings. On June 30, 2016, FiberCo assigned all of its rights and obligations in its capacity as a lender to a third party. During 2016, we incurred $0.4 million of related-party interest expense associated with this related-party debt. We did not incur related-party interest expense during 2017. Please read -Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d below.\nEarly retirement of debt obligation\nWe incurred a $4.4 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the partial write-off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The amounts were amortized over the term of the debt and were expensed on December 14, 2016 when we repaid $158.1 million outstanding under the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nOther (expense) income\nCertain cash flow hedges related to foreign currency exchange risk previously designated as hedges ceased to qualify for hedge accounting treatment and we discontinued hedge accounting for such hedge transactions on December 31, 2017.

The factors impacting adjusted gross margin are detailed above under the heading Gross margin.\u201d\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, general and administrative expenses included allocated expenses of $14.2 million that were incurred under the MSA, $2.4 and $7.0 million related to development activities prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down and the Sampson Drop-Down,\nrespectively, $4.5 million of direct expenses, $4.2 million of non-cash unit compensation expense associated with unit-based awards and $0.8 million related to acquisition transaction expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $16.2 million under the MSA, $0.6 million and $1.6 million related to development activities prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down and Sampson Drop-Down, respectively, $3.6 million of direct expenses, $0.7 million of compensation expense associated with unit-based awards, $0.4 million of accounting, legal and other expenses related to our Reorganization activities and $0.9 million of expenses related to acquisition transaction expenses.\nImpairment of assets held for sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a $10.0 million non-cash impairment charge related to the sale of the Wiggins plant.\nInterest expense\nWe incurred $15.6 million of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. On November 1, 2016, the proceeds from the Senior Notes were deposited into an escrow account pending completion of the Sampson Drop-Down. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to repay a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, we incurred interest expense on both the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities during the escrow period. Please read -Senior Notes Due 2021\u201d below.\nRelated-party interest expense\nWe incurred $0.6 million of related-party interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $1.2 million of related-party interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015. On December 11, 2015, under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we obtained incremental borrowings in the amount of $36.5 million. FiberCo became a lender with the purchase of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of the incremental borrowing advances. On June 30, 2016, FiberCo assigned all of its rights and obligations in its capacity as a lender to a third party. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $0.4 million of related-party interest expense associated with this related-party debt.\nIn connection with the January 5, 2015 acquisition of Cottondale (formerly owned by Green Circle), the sponsor made a term advance of $36.7 million to Cottondale under a revolving note and advanced Acquisition II $50.0 million under a note payable. Cottondale repaid $4.8 million of the outstanding principal of the term advance in March 2015. As a result of the sponsor's contribution of Acquisition II, which owned Cottondale, to the Partnership on April 9, 2015, we recorded $81.9 million of outstanding principal and $0.9 million of accrued interest related to the term advance and note payable. In connection with the closing of the IPO on May 4, 2015, we repaid the term advance and note payable outstanding principal of $81.9 million and accrued interest of $1.1 million to the sponsor. We incurred $1.1 million of related-party interest expense for the term advance and note payable for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEarly retirement of debt obligation\nWe incurred a $4.4 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the partial write-off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The amounts were amortized over the term of the debt and were expensed on December 14, 2016 when we repaid $158.1 million outstanding under the existing Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nWe incurred a $4.7 million charge during the year ended December 31, 2015 for the write-off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities (the Prior Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). The amounts were amortized over the term of the debt and were expensed on April 9, 2015 when we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Prior Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nIncome tax expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred no income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred income tax expense of $2.7 million related to the separate activity of the Cottondale plant from the date of acquisition on January 5, 2015 through April 8, 2015. During this period, Green Circle was a corporate subsidiary of the predecessor entity of Acquisition II. Green Circle, which is now Cottondale, and Acquisition II were each treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes until April 7, 2015 and April 8, 2015, respectively. Prior to the contribution of Acquisition II to us on April 9, 2015, the financial results of the predecessor entity of each of Acquisition II and Green Circle were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the tax paying entity, Acquisition I.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2015 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,100)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdd:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,003)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,509\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarly retirement of debt obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(261)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase accounting adjustment to inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(697)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-cash unit compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,526\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,623)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset impairments and disposals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,296\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransaction expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(66)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,581\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of $79.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $7.6 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the $14.5 million increase in adjusted gross margin discussed in further detail above. Offsetting the increase to adjusted gross margin was a $7.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to development activities prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down and the Sampson Drop-Down as discussed above under -General and administrative expenses.\u201d\nDistributable cash flow\nThe following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to distributable cash flow:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2015 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n79,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,581\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net of amortization of debt issuance costs, debt premium costs and original issue discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,223\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDistributable cash flow to Enviva Partners, LP limited partners\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,530\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Distributable cash flow attributable to incentive distribution rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,077\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDistributable cash flow attributable to Enviva Partners, LP limited partners\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,453\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal liquidity requirements for 2017 were to fund working capital, service our debt, maintain cash reserves, finance growth and maintenance capital expenditures, pay distributions and fund a portion of the Wilmington Drop-Down. We met our liquidity needs in 2017 with a combination of funds generated through operations, net proceeds from the sales of our additional Senior Notes, borrowings under our revolving credit commitments and proceeds from the sales of common units under our ATM Program.\nOur principal liquidity requirements for the year ended December 31, 2016 were to fund working capital, service our debt, maintain cash reserves, finance growth and maintenance capital expenditures, pay distributions and fund a portion of the Sampson Drop-Down. We met our liquidity needs in 2016 with a combination of funds generated through operations, net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, borrowings under our revolving credit commitments and proceeds from the sales of common units under our ATM Program.\nWe expect our sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit commitments and, from time to time, debt and equity offerings, including under our ATM Program. We operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to fund working capital, service our debt, maintain cash reserves, finance maintenance capital expenditures and pay distributions. We believe cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet the short-term working capital requirements of our business. However, future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.\nOur minimum quarterly distribution is $0.4125 per common and subordinated unit per quarter, which equates to approximately $10.9 million per quarter, or approximately $43.4 million per year, based on the number of common and subordinated units outstanding as of February 16, 2018, to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses. Because it is our intent to distribute at least the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our units on a quarterly basis, we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources, including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund future acquisitions and expansions.\nNon-Cash Working Capital\nNon-cash working capital is the amount by which current assets, excluding cash, exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our non-cash working capital was $34.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $45.9 million at December 31, 2016. The primary components of changes in non-cash working capital were the following:\nAccounts receivable, net and related-party receivables\nAccounts receivable, net and related-party receivables decreased non-cash working capital by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the number of shipments from our own production plants and shipments purchased and sold during December 2017. Related-party receivables at December 31, 2017 included $4.9 million due from the First Hancock JV related to the Sampson Drop-Down and the Wilmington Drop-Down.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process, consumable tooling and finished goods. Inventories decreased to $23.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $29.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in inventory was attributable to a $5.5 million decrease in finished goods inventory due to the timing, volume and size of product shipments and a $3.2 million decrease in raw material inventories to support the reliability of our planned production\nlevels. The decrease in inventory was partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in consumable tooling and spare parts inventory.\nAssets held for sale\nAssets held for sale decreased $3.0 million at December 31, 2017. At December 2016, we initiated a plan to sell the Wiggins plant and reflected $3.0 million as the carrying amount of the assets held for sale. We sold the Wiggins plant to a third-party buyer on December 27, 2017, and on December 28, 2017, Wiggins was dissolved and deconsolidated.\nAccounts payable, related-party payables, accrued liabilities and related-party accrued liabilities\nThe decrease in accounts payable, related-party payables, accrued liabilities and related-party accrued liabilities at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 increased non-cash working capital by $3.1 million and was primarily attributable to a decrease in shipping and trading sales liabilities due to timing and volume of product shipments. Related-party payables at December 31, 2017 included $19.6 million related to the MSA, compared to $10.9 million related to the MSA at December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to the timing of payments at year end.\nCurrent portion of interest payable\nAn increase in the current portion of interest payable at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 decreased non-cash working capital by $0.6 million. The current portion of interest payable is primarily related to\naccrued interest on our Senior Notes. Please read -Senior Notes Due 2021\u201d below.\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations\nAn increase in the current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 decreased non-cash working capital by $2.0 million due to payments related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 (Recast)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2015 (Recast)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n87,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,857\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(28,601)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(111,124)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(103,490)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(58,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,173\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,662)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,540\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $87.1 million, $55.8 million and $65.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The increase in accounts receivable, net, was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses primarily attributable to the aforementioned shipments and purchase and sale transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $28.6 million, $111.1 million and $103.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash used in investing activities from the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 related primarily to the construction of the Sampson plant and Wilmington terminal. Of the $28.7 million used for property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $5.7 million related to projects intended to increase the production capacity of our plants and $4.4 million was used to maintain our equipment and machinery. Of the remaining amount in 2017, $10.2 million was used for the construction of the Sampson plant and $8.4 million was used for the construction of the Wilmington terminal.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(58.4) million, $53.7 million and $39.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to distributions paid to our unitholders of $64.3 million, distributions to our sponsor of $55.9 million related to the Wilmington Drop-Down and $83.0 million of repayments, net, on our debt and capital lease obligations. The net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $60.0 million from the additional Senior Notes and $72.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit commitments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 related primarily to proceeds from the Partnership's Senior Notes offering and the Sampson Drop-Down. Net proceeds of $293.6 million from our Senior Notes were used to repay debt, including $158.1 million due under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and to distribute $139.6 million to our sponsor related to the Sampson Drop-Down.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities of $230.1 million and IPO proceeds of $215.1 million. Also contributing to net cash provided by financing activities were capital contributions made by the First Hancock JV prior to the Wilmington Drop-Down and the Sampson Drop-Down of $43.6 million and $62.0 million, respectively. These amounts were partially offset by $199.6 million of repayments, net, to our debt and capital lease obligations, $297.2 million in distributions to our sponsor and the payment of cash distributions to unitholders of $16.9 million.\nSenior Notes Due 2021\nOn November 1, 2016, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Enviva Partners Finance Corp. (together, the Issuers\u201d), Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, and the guarantors thereto entered into an indenture, as amended or supplemented (the Indenture\u201d), pursuant to which we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to eligible purchasers (the Senior Notes Offering\u201d) in a private placement under the Securities Act, which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand and the issuance of $30.0 million in common units to the First Hancock JV, funded the consideration payable in connection with the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes was used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions associated with, and no events of default existed under, the Indenture as of December 31, 2017. The Senior\nNotes are guaranteed jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of our existing subsidiaries and our future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee certain of our indebtedness. In August 2017, holders of 100% of the Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes (except that such registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nOn October 10, 2017, pursuant to the Indenture, the Issuers issued and sold an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to a purchaser (the Additional Notes Purchaser\u201d) at 106.25% of par value plus accrued interest from May 1, 2017. The additional Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture and have the same terms as the Senior Notes. The sale of the additional Senior Notes resulted in gross proceeds to the Issuers of approximately $60.0 million. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down, and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the Additional Notes Purchaser tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer). The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. We recorded $0.9 million in issue discounts and costs and $3.4 million in premiums associated with the issuance of the additional Senior Notes, which have been recorded as a net addition to long-term debt and capital lease obligations.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOn April 9, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement providing for the Original Credit Facilities. The Original Credit Facilities consisted of (i) $99.5 million aggregate principal amount of Tranche A-1 borrowings, (ii) $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of Tranche A-2 borrowings and (iii) up to $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolving credit commitments. We are also able to request loans under incremental facilities under the Credit Agreement on the terms and conditions and in the maximum aggregate principal amounts set forth therein, provided that lenders provide commitments to make loans under such incremental facilities.\nOn December 11, 2015, we entered into the First Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement (the Assumption Agreement\u201d) providing for the Incremental Term Borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Incremental Term Borrowings consist of (i) $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of Tranche A-3 borrowings and (ii) $26.5 million aggregate principal amount of Tranche A-4 borrowings.\nOn December 11, 2015, FiberCo became a lender pursuant to the Credit Agreement with a purchase of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A-4 borrowings, net of a 1.0% lender fee. On June 30, 2016, FiberCo assigned all of its rights and obligations in its capacity as a lender to a third party. The Partnership recorded $0 and $0.4 million as interest expense related to this indebtedness during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.\nOn October 17, 2016, we entered into the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment provided for an increase in the revolving credit commitments under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities from $25.0 million to $100.0 million upon the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, the repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-2 and Tranche A-4 borrowings and the receipt of certain associated deliverables.\nOn December 14, 2016, proceeds from the Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness, including accrued interest, in the amount of $74.7 million for Tranche A-2 and $26.5 million for Tranche A-4 under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness, including accrued interest, in the amount of $53.6 million for Tranche A-1 and $5.1 million for Tranche A-3, under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded a $4.4 million loss on early retirement of debt obligations related to the repayments.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature in April 2020. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate plus an applicable margin or at a Eurodollar rate (with a 1.00% floor for term loan borrowings) plus an applicable margin. Principal and interest are payable quarterly.\nWe had $4.0 million outstanding under the letter of credit facility as of December 31, 2017. The letter of credit was issued in connection with a contract between us and a third party, in the ordinary course of business. The amount required to be secured with the letter of credit under the contract may be adjusted or cancelled based on the specific third-party contract terms. The amount outstanding as of December 31, 2017 is subject to automatic extensions through the termination date of the letter of credit facility. The letter of credit is not cash collateralized, and there are no unreimbursed drawings under the letter of credit as of December 31, 2017. On January 11, 2018, the letter of credit was cancelled as it was no longer contractually required.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, restrictions and events of default including, but not limited to, a change of control restriction and limitations on our ability to (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, (iv) make loans and investments, (v) sell assets, (vi) incur liens, (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates, (viii) consolidate or merge and (ix) assign certain material contracts to third parties or unrestricted subsidiaries. An event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligation to repay our borrowings and may cause a net settlement of our derivative instruments with the respective counterparties. We will be restricted from making distributions if an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or if the interest coverage ratio (determined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to consolidated interest expense, determined quarterly) is less than 2.25:1.00 at such time.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA ( Total Leverage Ratio\u201d), as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not more than a maximum ratio, initially set at 4.25:1.00 and stepping down to 3.75:1.00 during the term of the Credit Agreement; provided that the maximum permitted Total Leverage Ratio will be increased by 0.50:1.00 for the period from the consummation of certain qualifying acquisitions through the end of the second full fiscal quarter thereafter.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Total Leverage Ratio was 3.67:1.00, as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement, which was less than the maximum ratio of 4.75:1.00. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions associated with, and no events of default existed under, the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by liens on substantially all of our and their assets.\nAt-the-Market Offering Program\nOn August 8, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration filed with the SEC on June 24, 2016, for the registration of the continuous offering of up to $100.0 million of common units, in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. In August 2016, we also entered into the Equity Distribution Agreement with certain managers pursuant to which we may offer and sell common units from time to time through or to one or more of the managers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement, of up to an aggregate sales amount of $100.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 71,368 common units under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.9 million, net of an insignificant amount of commissions. Accounting and other fees of approximately $0.2 million were offset against the proceeds during 2017. Net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program were used for general partnership purposes. As of February 16, 2018, $88.6 million remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2023 and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2021 - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBeyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n399,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n355,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther loans and capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n61,525\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n123,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShipping commitments (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n443,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n115,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n117,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n152,221\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther purchase commitments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n202,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n90,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,574\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,254,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n138,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n300,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n595,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n220,320\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur long-term debt as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $352.2 million of outstanding indebtedness, increased by a premium of $3.2 million and offset by an unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $6.0 million, under our Senior Notes, and $43.6 million of outstanding indebtedness, offset by an unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe cash obligations for interest expense reflect, as of December 31, 2017, (i) interest expense related to $355.0 million of Senior Notes bearing interest at 8.50%, $43.0 million of Tranche A-1 advances and $4.75 million of Tranche A-3 advances bearing interest at a Eurodollar rate (with a 1.00% floor) plus an applicable margin, adjusted for the Partnership's pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap, and (ii) interest expense related to the Amory Note, which bears interest at a rate of 6.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $3.5 million of purchase obligations which consisted of commitments for the purchase of materials, supplies and the engagement of services for the operation of our plants and facilities to be used in the normal course of business.

Our contracts with shippers include provisions as to the minimum amount of metric tons per year to be shipped and may also stipulate the number of shipments. Pursuant to these contracts, the terms extend to up to fifteen years, charges are based on a fixed-price per metric ton and, in some cases, there are adjustment provisions for increases in the price of fuel or for other distribution-related costs. The price per metric ton may also vary depending on the loading port and the discharge port. Our shippers commit their resources based on our planned shipments, and we would likely be liable for a portion of their expenses if we deviated from our communicated plans. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate our obligations related to these shipping contracts to be approximately $444.0 million through 2026.

One supply agreement for the purchase of 720,000 MT of wood pellets from British Columbia is fully offset by an agreement to sell 720,000 MT of wood pellets to the same counterparty from our terminal locations. The amounts in the table represent an estimate of the costs we would incur under these contracts as of December 31, 2017. Many of our contracts are requirement contracts and currently do not represent a firm commitment to purchase from our suppliers; therefore, they are not reflected in the table above. Under these contracts, we may be liable for the costs incurred on services rendered until termination and the costs of any supplies on hand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies -Recent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nListed below are accounting policies we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, which we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under off-take contracts, the majority of the commitments under which are long-term in nature. We refer to the structure of our contracts as take-or-pay\u201d because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in the case of a customer's failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination by a customer. Each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell, the fixed price per metric ton for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications. These prices are fixed for the entire term, subject to annual inflation-based adjustments and price escalators, as well as, in some instances, price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs. In addition to sales of our product under these long-term, take-or-pay contracts, we routinely sell wood pellets under shorter-term contracts, which range in volume and tenor and, in some cases, may include only one specific shipment. Because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement, our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends. Our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the customer, the sales price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDepending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either CIF, CFR or FOB. Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognition between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin.\nIn some cases, we may purchase shipments of product from a third-party supplier and resell them in back-to-back transactions that immediately transfer title and risk of loss to the ultimate purchaser. Thus, the revenue from these transactions is recorded net of costs paid to the third-party supplier. We record this revenue as Other revenue.\u201d\nIn instances when a customer requests the cancellation, deferral or acceleration of a shipment, the customer may pay a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs incurred by us, which is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nOther revenue also includes third- and related-party terminal services fees.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers. The principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material, production and distribution costs.\nWe have strategically located our plants in the Southeastern United States, a region with plentiful wood fiber resources. We manage the supply of raw materials into our plants primarily through short-term contracts. Delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage as well as harvesting, transportation and, in some cases, size reduction services provided by our suppliers. The majority of our product volumes are sold under long-term off-take contracts that include cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs.\nProduction costs at our production plants consist of labor, energy, tooling, repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs. Production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment and any gain or loss on disposal of associated assets. Some of our off-take contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs. In addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants, we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from third-party wood pellet producers.\nDistribution costs include all transportation costs from our plants to our port locations, any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers. Both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our marine terminals has allowed for the efficient and cost-effective transportation of our wood pellets. We seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into long-term, fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our off-take contracts pursuant to which we are responsible for arranging shipping. Certain of our off-take contracts include pricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices, which allows us to pass the majority of the fuel price risk associated with shipping through to our customers under those contracts.\nAdditionally, as deliveries are made, we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangible assets during the applicable contract term.\nRaw material, production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our owned and leased marine terminals and related- and third-party wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory. Fixed production overhead, including the related depreciation expense, is allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the facilities. These costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold. Distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable acquired customer contracts are expensed as incurred. Our inventory is recorded using FIFO, which requires the use of judgment and estimates. Given the nature of our inventory, the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the FIFO inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes the fair values of assets acquired. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. Useful lives of assets are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in the expected physical life of the asset, its planned use,\ntechnological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate. Changes in useful lives are recognized prospectively.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Plant and equipment held under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.\nConstruction in progress primarily represents expenditures for the development and expansion of facilities. Capitalized interest cost and all direct costs, which include equipment and engineering costs related to the development and expansion of facilities, are capitalized as construction in progress. Depreciation is not recognized for amounts in construction in progress.\nNormal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts incurred that extend an asset's useful life, increase its productivity or add production capacity are capitalized. Direct costs, such as outside labor, materials, internal payroll and benefits costs incurred during the construction of a new plant are capitalized; indirect costs are not capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs were $21.4 million, $15.9 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAsset Impairment Assessments\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to such asset or asset group's carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\nIn December 2016, the Partnership recorded an impairment of $10.0 million related to the fixed assets at the Wiggins plant. For more information, please read -Recent Developments-Sale of the Enviva Wiggins Plant\u201d above. The Partnership did not record any impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 10, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). [Bill: why do we use numbers here. We don't for other items above]\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid for acquired businesses in excess of the identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually on December 1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Partnership identified one reporting unit that corresponded to the Partnership's one segment and selected the fourth fiscal quarter to perform its annual goodwill impairment test.\nThe Partnership first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative testing. If this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and the Partnership is not required to perform the two-step impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) past, current and projected future financial performance, (iii) industry and market considerations, (iv) changes in the costs of raw materials, fuel and labor and (v) entity-specific factors such as changes in management or customer base.\nIf the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Partnership will perform a two-step impairment test. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Partnership applied the qualitative test and determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value, and, accordingly, was not required to apply the two-step impairment test. The Partnership did not record any goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (see Note 10, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets).", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of Enviva, LP and its subsidiaries, focusing on historical performance, operational structure, and recent developments.

Please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 and Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for information regarding certain risks inherent in our business.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and the audited financial statements of our Predecessor and Enviva Pellets Cottondale, LLC ( Cottondale\u201d). On April 9, 2015, we, the Predecessor and our sponsor executed a series of transactions that were accounted for as common control transactions (the Reorganization\u201d). On April 9, 2015, our sponsor contributed some, but not all, of our Predecessor's assets and liabilities to us. Specifically, our sponsor's interest in Enviva Pellets Southampton, LLC ( Southampton\u201d) was excluded from the April 9, 2015 contribution as it was conveyed to the First Hancock JV, a consolidated entity of the sponsor, on April 9, 2015. Our sponsor contributed its interest in Cottondale, which owns a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the Cottondale plant\u201d), to us on April 9, 2015.\nOn December 11, 2015, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Southampton together with an off-take contract and a related third-party shipping contract for total consideration of $131.0 million pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Southampton Drop-Down\u201d).\nOn December 14, 2016, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC ( Sampson\u201d) for total consideration of $175.0 million (the Sampson Drop-Down\u201d). The Sampson Drop-Down also included two off-take contracts and related third-party shipping contracts.\nOn October 2, 2017, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC ( Wilmington\u201d) for total consideration of $130.0 million (the Wilmington Drop-Down\u201d).\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our initial public offering ( the IPO\u201d) include the results of our Predecessor and its subsidiaries and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to our Predecessor after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements for the period after the IPO pertain to our operations. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in our Predecessor and Enviva GP, LLC as if the contributions had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, the contribution of Enviva Cottondale Acquisition II, LLC ( Acquisition II\u201d) as if the contribution had occurred on January 5, 2015, which is the date on which our sponsor\nacquired Green Circle Bio Energy, Inc. ( Green Circle\u201d), which owned the Cottondale plant, the Southampton Drop-Down as if it occurred on April 9, 2015, the date Southampton was originally conveyed to the First Hancock JV and the Sampson Drop-Down and the Wilmington Drop-Down as if they had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson and Wilmington were originally organized. Entities contributed by or distributed to our sponsor or the First Hancock JV are considered entities under common control and are recorded at historical cost.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.9 million MTPY. We also own dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal assets at the Port of Chesapeake (the Chesapeake terminal\u201d) and the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina (the Wilmington terminal\u201d). All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective. For a more complete description of our business, please read Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOur sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the Partnership. During 2017, contracted volumes under our existing off-take contracts are approximately equal to the full production capacity of our production plants.\nOur off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.9 million metric tons ( MT\u201d) of wood pellets in 2018 and have a weighted-average remaining term of 9.5 years from February 15, 2018. We intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for our product that is driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants to co-fired or dedicated biomass-fired plants, principally in Europe and, increasingly, in South Korea and Japan.\nRecent Developments\nWilmington Drop-Down\nOn October 2, 2017, pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Wilmington Contribution Agreement\u201d), the First Hancock JV sold to the Partnership all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Wilmington, which owns the Wilmington terminal.\nThe purchase price for Wilmington was $130.0 million, which included an initial payment of $54.6 million, net of an approximate purchase price adjustment of $1.4 million. The initial payment was funded with borrowings from revolving credit commitments and cash on hand. We accounted for the Wilmington Drop-Down as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the acquisition were retrospectively recast to reflect the acquisition as if it had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized.\nThe Wilmington terminal, which is capable of receiving product by rail and truck, has the capacity to store up to 90,000 MT of wood pellets, and load up to Panamax-sized vessels. It utilizes state-of-the-art handling equipment and storage infrastructure designed to maintain product quality and safety with throughput capacity of up to 3.0 million MTPY of wood pellets.\nWilmington will handle up to approximately 600,000 MTPY of throughput from the Sampson plant and is party to a long-term terminal services agreement with Enviva Pellets Greenwood, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Second Hancock JV ( Greenwood\u201d). Wilmington will handle throughput volumes sourced from Greenwood's wood pellet production plant located in Greenwood, South Carolina (the Greenwood plant\u201d). The terminal services agreement with Greenwood provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met.\nIn addition, the Wilmington Contribution Agreement contemplates that Wilmington will enter into a long-term terminal services agreement (the Wilmington Hamlet TSA\u201d) with the First Hancock JV and Enviva Pellets Hamlet, LLC ( Hamlet\u201d) to receive, store and load wood pellets from the First Hancock JV's proposed production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the Hamlet plant\u201d) when the First Hancock JV completes construction of the Hamlet plant. The Wilmington Hamlet TSA also provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met. Pursuant to the Wilmington Contribution Agreement, following notice of the anticipated first delivery of wood pellets to the Wilmington terminal from the Hamlet plant, Wilmington, Hamlet, and the First Hancock JV would enter into the Wilmington Hamlet TSA and the Partnership would make a final payment of $74.0 million in cash or common units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership ( common units\u201d) to the First Hancock JV, subject to certain conditions, as deferred consideration for the Wilmington Drop-Down.\nWilmington also entered into a throughput option agreement with the sponsor granting the sponsor, subject to certain conditions, the option to obtain terminal services at the Wilmington terminal at marginal cost throughput rates for wood pellets produced by one of the sponsor's potential wood pellet production plants.\nSenior Notes Due 2021\nOn November 1, 2016, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2021 (the Senior Notes\u201d) to eligible purchasers in a private placement transaction. In August 2017, holders of 100% of the Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nOn October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at a price of 106.25% of par plus accrued interest from May 1, 2017. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The net proceeds were used to repay the borrowings on our revolving credit facility that were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer). The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the outstanding Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nSale of the Wiggins Plant\nIn December 2016, we initiated a plan to sell our 110,000 MTPY production plant located in Wiggins, Mississippi and related assets (the Wiggins plant\u201d). We sold the Wiggins plant to a third-party buyer for a purchase price of $0.4 million on December 27, 2017, and on December 28, 2017, Enviva Pellets Wiggins, LLC ( Wiggins\u201d), the owner of the Wiggins plant, was dissolved. We recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8 million, net, upon deconsolidation.\nAt-the-Market Offering Program\nOn August 8, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Act Commission ( SEC\u201d) on June 24, 2016, for the continuous offering of up to $100.0 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. In August 2016, we also entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with certain managers pursuant to which we may offer and sell common units from time to time through or to one or more of the managers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement, of up to an aggregate sales amount of $100.0 million (the ATM Program\u201d).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold 71,368 and 358,593, respectively, under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.9 million, net of an insignificant amount of commissions, during 2017, and net proceeds of $9.3 million, net of $0.1 million of commissions, during 2016. Accounting and other fees of approximately $0.2 million were offset against the proceeds during 2017. Deferred issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million, primarily consisting of legal, accounting and other fees, were offset against the proceeds during 2016. Net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program were used for general partnership purposes. As of February 16, 2018, $88.6 million of common units remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nAdjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\nWe use adjusted gross margin per metric ton to measure our financial performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding asset disposals and depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe view adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of our financial performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs, debt premium and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Please read Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of each of adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFactors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations and cash flows, principally for the following reasons:\nOur sponsor contributed its interest in Wilmington to us on October 2, 2017. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Wilmington as if the contribution had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized. The recast amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily include general and administrative expenses associated with terminal development costs incurred during the construction of the Wilmington terminal. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the terminal began operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. The amount paid in excess of historical cost is recorded as a deemed dividend to the General Partner.\nWe increased our production capacity with the Sampson Drop-Down and began deliveries under a new long-term off-take contract in December 2016. In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, the First Hancock JV assigned to us a ten-year, take-or-pay off-take contract with \u00d8rsted (the \u00d8rsted Contract\u201d). The \u00d8rsted Contract commenced on September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an amendment to the \u00d8rsted Contract for the supply of an incremental 200,000 MT from late 2018 through mid-2021. \u00d8rsted's obligations under the \u00d8rsted Contract are guaranteed by its parent, \u00d8rsted A/S. The \u00d8rsted Contract, accompanied by our increased production capacity from the Sampson plant, will have a material effect on our product sales and resulting gross margin.\nWe issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On November 1, 2016, we and Enviva Partners Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership formed on October 3, 2016 for the purpose of being the co-issuer of the notes, issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand and the issuance of 1,098,415 unregistered common units at a value of $27.31 per unit, or $30.0 million of common units, to affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), funded the consideration payable for the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering was used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, our consolidated financial statements reflect the outstanding debt and interest expense associated with the Senior Notes.\nWe issued $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nThe sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million, after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down, and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nWe repaid a portion of the Original Credit Facilities and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility. On April 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for a $199.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities (the Original Credit Facilities\u201d). We entered into an\nassumption agreement on December 11, 2015, providing for $36.5 million of incremental term loan borrowings (the Incremental Term Borrowings\u201d and, together with the Original Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) under the Credit Agreement. In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d), which became effective upon the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down. Upon the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, was used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-2 and Tranche A-4 borrowings and to repay a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-1 and Tranche A-3 borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Following the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down and repayment of a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the limit under our revolving credit commitments was increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million pursuant to the Second Amendment.\nRevenue and costs for deliveries to customers can vary significantly between periods depending upon the mix of customers and specific shipment and reimbursement for expenses, including the then-current cost of fuel. Depending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either Cost, Insurance and Freight ( CIF\u201d), Cost and Freight ( CFR\u201d) or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. We have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOverview\nWe primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under off-take contracts, the majority of the commitments under which are long term in nature. We refer to the structure of our contracts as take-or-pay\u201d because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in case a customer fails to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or terminates the contract. Each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell, the fixed price per MT for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications. These prices are fixed for the entire term, subject to annual inflation-based adjustments and price escalators, as well as, in some instances, price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs. In addition to sales of our product under these long-term, take-or-pay contracts, we routinely sell wood pellets under shorter-term contracts, which range in volume and tenor and, in some cases, may include only one specific shipment. Because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement, our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends. Our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the customer, the sales price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDepending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either CIF, CFR or FOB. Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognized between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin.\nThe majority of the wood pellets we supply to our customers is produced at our production plants, the sales of which are included in Product Sales.\u201d We also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by purchasing from and selling to third-party market participants, including, in some\ncases, our customers. In these back-to-back transactions where title and risk of loss are immediately transferred to the ultimate purchaser, revenue is recorded net of costs paid to the third-party supplier. This revenue is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nIn some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer, or accelerate a shipment. Contractually, we will seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, including in some cases a related party, either within our contracted off-take portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nContracted Backlog\nAs of February 15, 2018, we had approximately $5.8 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to power generators compared to approximately $5.7 billion as of February 1, 2017. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2018 forward rates. Please read Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Derivative Instruments\u201d for more information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts.\nOur expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 15, 2018 is as follows (in millions):\n\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers. The principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material, production and distribution costs.\nWe have strategically located our plants in the Southeastern United States, a region with plentiful wood fiber resources. We manage the supply of raw materials into our plants through a mixture of short-term and long-term contracts. Delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage as well as harvesting, transportation and, in some cases, size reduction services provided by our suppliers. The majority of our product volumes are sold under off-take contracts that include cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs.\nProduction costs at our production plants consist of labor, energy, tooling, repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs. Production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment and any gain or loss on disposal of associated assets. Some of our off-take contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs. In addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants, we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from our sponsor and third-party wood pellet producers.\nDistribution costs include all transportation costs from our plants to our port locations, any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers. Both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our deep-water terminals have allowed for the efficient and cost-effective transportation of our wood pellets. We seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into long-term, fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our off-take contracts pursuant to which we are responsible for arranging shipping. Certain of our off-take contracts include\npricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices, which allow us to pass the majority of the fuel price risk associated with shipping through to our customers.\nAdditionally, as deliveries are made, we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangible assets during the applicable contract term.\nRaw material, production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our owned and leased marine terminals and related- and third-party wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory. Fixed production overhead, including the related depreciation expense, is allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the facilities. These costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold. Distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable acquired customer contracts are expensed as incurred. Our inventory is recorded using the first-in, first-out method ( FIFO\u201d), which requires the use of judgment and estimates. Given the nature of our inventory, the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the FIFO inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe and our General Partner are party to a Management Services Agreement (the MSA\u201d) with Enviva Management. Under the MSA, direct or indirect internal or third-party expenses incurred are either directly identifiable or allocated to us. Enviva Management estimates the percentage of employee salaries and related benefits, third-party costs, office rent and expenses and any other overhead costs to be provided to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 and Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for information regarding certain risks inherent in our business.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and the audited financial statements of our Predecessor and Enviva Pellets Cottondale, LLC ( Cottondale\u201d). On April 9, 2015, we, the Predecessor and our sponsor executed a series of transactions that were accounted for as common control transactions (the Reorganization\u201d). On April 9, 2015, our sponsor contributed some, but not all, of our Predecessor's assets and liabilities to us. Specifically, our sponsor's interest in Enviva Pellets Southampton, LLC ( Southampton\u201d) was excluded from the April 9, 2015 contribution as it was conveyed to the First Hancock JV, a consolidated entity of the sponsor, on April 9, 2015. Our sponsor contributed its interest in Cottondale, which owns a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the Cottondale plant\u201d), to us on April 9, 2015.\nOn December 11, 2015, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Southampton together with an off-take contract and a related third-party shipping contract for total consideration of $131.0 million pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Southampton Drop-Down\u201d).\nOn December 14, 2016, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC ( Sampson\u201d) for total consideration of $175.0 million (the Sampson Drop-Down\u201d). The Sampson Drop-Down also included two off-take contracts and related third-party shipping contracts.\nOn October 2, 2017, the First Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC ( Wilmington\u201d) for total consideration of $130.0 million (the Wilmington Drop-Down\u201d).\nThe consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our initial public offering ( the IPO\u201d) include the results of our Predecessor and its subsidiaries and include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities attributed to our Predecessor after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements for the period after the IPO pertain to our operations. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in our Predecessor and Enviva GP, LLC as if the contributions had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, the contribution of Enviva Cottondale Acquisition II, LLC ( Acquisition II\u201d) as if the contribution had occurred on January 5, 2015, which is the date on which our sponsor\nacquired Green Circle Bio Energy, Inc. ( Green Circle\u201d), which owned the Cottondale plant, the Southampton Drop-Down as if it occurred on April 9, 2015, the date Southampton was originally conveyed to the First Hancock JV and the Sampson Drop-Down and the Wilmington Drop-Down as if they had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson and Wilmington were originally organized. Entities contributed by or distributed to our sponsor or the First Hancock JV are considered entities under common control and are recorded at historical cost.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.9 million MTPY. We also own dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal assets at the Port of Chesapeake (the Chesapeake terminal\u201d) and the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina (the Wilmington terminal\u201d). All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective. For a more complete description of our business, please read Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nOur sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the Partnership. During 2017, contracted volumes under our existing off-take contracts are approximately equal to the full production capacity of our production plants.\nOur off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.9 million metric tons ( MT\u201d) of wood pellets in 2018 and have a weighted-average remaining term of 9.5 years from February 15, 2018. We intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for our product that is driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants to co-fired or dedicated biomass-fired plants, principally in Europe and, increasingly, in South Korea and Japan.\nRecent Developments\nWilmington Drop-Down\nOn October 2, 2017, pursuant to the terms of a contribution agreement between the Partnership and the First Hancock JV (the Wilmington Contribution Agreement\u201d), the First Hancock JV sold to the Partnership all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Wilmington, which owns the Wilmington terminal.\nThe purchase price for Wilmington was $130.0 million, which included an initial payment of $54.6 million, net of an approximate purchase price adjustment of $1.4 million. The initial payment was funded with borrowings from revolving credit commitments and cash on hand. We accounted for the Wilmington Drop-Down as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the acquisition were retrospectively recast to reflect the acquisition as if it had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized.\nThe Wilmington terminal, which is capable of receiving product by rail and truck, has the capacity to store up to 90,000 MT of wood pellets, and load up to Panamax-sized vessels. It utilizes state-of-the-art handling equipment and storage infrastructure designed to maintain product quality and safety with throughput capacity of up to 3.0 million MTPY of wood pellets.\nWilmington will handle up to approximately 600,000 MTPY of throughput from the Sampson plant and is party to a long-term terminal services agreement with Enviva Pellets Greenwood, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Second Hancock JV ( Greenwood\u201d). Wilmington will handle throughput volumes sourced from Greenwood's wood pellet production plant located in Greenwood, South Carolina (the Greenwood plant\u201d). The terminal services agreement with Greenwood provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met.\nIn addition, the Wilmington Contribution Agreement contemplates that Wilmington will enter into a long-term terminal services agreement (the Wilmington Hamlet TSA\u201d) with the First Hancock JV and Enviva Pellets Hamlet, LLC ( Hamlet\u201d) to receive, store and load wood pellets from the First Hancock JV's proposed production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the Hamlet plant\u201d) when the First Hancock JV completes construction of the Hamlet plant. The Wilmington Hamlet TSA also provides for deficiency payments to Wilmington if minimum throughput requirements are not met. Pursuant to the Wilmington Contribution Agreement, following notice of the anticipated first delivery of wood pellets to the Wilmington terminal from the Hamlet plant, Wilmington, Hamlet, and the First Hancock JV would enter into the Wilmington Hamlet TSA and the Partnership would make a final payment of $74.0 million in cash or common units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership ( common units\u201d) to the First Hancock JV, subject to certain conditions, as deferred consideration for the Wilmington Drop-Down.\nWilmington also entered into a throughput option agreement with the sponsor granting the sponsor, subject to certain conditions, the option to obtain terminal services at the Wilmington terminal at marginal cost throughput rates for wood pellets produced by one of the sponsor's potential wood pellet production plants.\nSenior Notes Due 2021\nOn November 1, 2016, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2021 (the Senior Notes\u201d) to eligible purchasers in a private placement transaction. In August 2017, holders of 100% of the Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nOn October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at a price of 106.25% of par plus accrued interest from May 1, 2017. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The net proceeds were used to repay the borrowings on our revolving credit facility that were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer). The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the outstanding Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nSale of the Wiggins Plant\nIn December 2016, we initiated a plan to sell our 110,000 MTPY production plant located in Wiggins, Mississippi and related assets (the Wiggins plant\u201d). We sold the Wiggins plant to a third-party buyer for a purchase price of $0.4 million on December 27, 2017, and on December 28, 2017, Enviva Pellets Wiggins, LLC ( Wiggins\u201d), the owner of the Wiggins plant, was dissolved. We recorded a loss on the sale of $0.8 million, net, upon deconsolidation.\nAt-the-Market Offering Program\nOn August 8, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Act Commission ( SEC\u201d) on June 24, 2016, for the continuous offering of up to $100.0 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. In August 2016, we also entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with certain managers pursuant to which we may offer and sell common units from time to time through or to one or more of the managers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement, of up to an aggregate sales amount of $100.0 million (the ATM Program\u201d).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold 71,368 and 358,593, respectively, under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.9 million, net of an insignificant amount of commissions, during 2017, and net proceeds of $9.3 million, net of $0.1 million of commissions, during 2016. Accounting and other fees of approximately $0.2 million were offset against the proceeds during 2017. Deferred issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million, primarily consisting of legal, accounting and other fees, were offset against the proceeds during 2016. Net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program were used for general partnership purposes. As of February 16, 2018, $88.6 million of common units remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nAdjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\nWe use adjusted gross margin per metric ton to measure our financial performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding asset disposals and depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe view adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of our financial performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs, debt premium and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Please read Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of each of adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFactors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur future results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations and cash flows, principally for the following reasons:\nOur sponsor contributed its interest in Wilmington to us on October 2, 2017. Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Wilmington as if the contribution had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Wilmington was originally organized. The recast amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily include general and administrative expenses associated with terminal development costs incurred during the construction of the Wilmington terminal. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the terminal began operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. The amount paid in excess of historical cost is recorded as a deemed dividend to the General Partner.\nWe increased our production capacity with the Sampson Drop-Down and began deliveries under a new long-term off-take contract in December 2016. In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, the First Hancock JV assigned to us a ten-year, take-or-pay off-take contract with \u00d8rsted (the \u00d8rsted Contract\u201d). The \u00d8rsted Contract commenced on September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an amendment to the \u00d8rsted Contract for the supply of an incremental 200,000 MT from late 2018 through mid-2021. \u00d8rsted's obligations under the \u00d8rsted Contract are guaranteed by its parent, \u00d8rsted A/S. The \u00d8rsted Contract, accompanied by our increased production capacity from the Sampson plant, will have a material effect on our product sales and resulting gross margin.\nWe issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On November 1, 2016, we and Enviva Partners Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership formed on October 3, 2016 for the purpose of being the co-issuer of the notes, issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand and the issuance of 1,098,415 unregistered common units at a value of $27.31 per unit, or $30.0 million of common units, to affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), funded the consideration payable for the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering was used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, our consolidated financial statements reflect the outstanding debt and interest expense associated with the Senior Notes.\nWe issued $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On October 10, 2017, we completed the issuance to an institutional investor in a private placement transaction of an additional $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes have the same terms as our outstanding Senior Notes. The additional Senior Notes will be treated together with the Senior Notes as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.\nThe sale of the additional Senior Notes at a purchase price of $58.4 million resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million, after including accrued interest of $2.1 million and deducting estimated expenses of approximately $0.5 million. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which were used to fund the Wilmington Drop-Down, and for general partnership purposes.\nIn December 2017, the holder of 100% of the additional Senior Notes tendered such notes in exchange for newly issued registered notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the additional Senior Notes (except that the registered notes are not subject to restrictions on transfer).\nWe repaid a portion of the Original Credit Facilities and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility. On April 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for a $199.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities (the Original Credit Facilities\u201d). We entered into an\nassumption agreement on December 11, 2015, providing for $36.5 million of incremental term loan borrowings (the Incremental Term Borrowings\u201d and, together with the Original Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) under the Credit Agreement. In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment\u201d), which became effective upon the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down. Upon the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, was used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-2 and Tranche A-4 borrowings and to repay a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-1 and Tranche A-3 borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Following the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down and repayment of a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the limit under our revolving credit commitments was increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million pursuant to the Second Amendment.\nRevenue and costs for deliveries to customers can vary significantly between periods depending upon the mix of customers and specific shipment and reimbursement for expenses, including the then-current cost of fuel. Depending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either Cost, Insurance and Freight ( CIF\u201d), Cost and Freight ( CFR\u201d) or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. We have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOverview\nWe primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under off-take contracts, the majority of the commitments under which are long term in nature. We refer to the structure of our contracts as take-or-pay\u201d because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in case a customer fails to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or terminates the contract. Each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell, the fixed price per MT for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications. These prices are fixed for the entire term, subject to annual inflation-based adjustments and price escalators, as well as, in some instances, price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs. In addition to sales of our product under these long-term, take-or-pay contracts, we routinely sell wood pellets under shorter-term contracts, which range in volume and tenor and, in some cases, may include only one specific shipment. Because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement, our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends. Our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the customer, the sales price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nDepending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either CIF, CFR or FOB. Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Under a CFR contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance (excluding marine cargo insurance) and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. Shipping costs under CIF and CFR contracts are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under FOB contracts, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognized between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin.\nThe majority of the wood pellets we supply to our customers is produced at our production plants, the sales of which are included in Product Sales.\u201d We also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by purchasing from and selling to third-party market participants, including, in some\ncases, our customers. In these back-to-back transactions where title and risk of loss are immediately transferred to the ultimate purchaser, revenue is recorded net of costs paid to the third-party supplier. This revenue is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nIn some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer, or accelerate a shipment. Contractually, we will seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, including in some cases a related party, either within our contracted off-take portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in Other revenue.\u201d\nContracted Backlog\nAs of February 15, 2018, we had approximately $5.8 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to power generators compared to approximately $5.7 billion as of February 1, 2017. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2018 forward rates. Please read Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Derivative Instruments\u201d for more information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts.\nOur expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 15, 2018 is as follows (in millions):\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPeriod from February 15, 2018 to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ending December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear ending December 31, 2020 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,691\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal product sales contracted backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,796\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers. The principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material, production and distribution costs.\nWe have strategically located our plants in the Southeastern United States, a region with plentiful wood fiber resources. We manage the supply of raw materials into our plants through a mixture of short-term and long-term contracts. Delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage as well as harvesting, transportation and, in some cases, size reduction services provided by our suppliers. The majority of our product volumes are sold under off-take contracts that include cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs.\nProduction costs at our production plants consist of labor, energy, tooling, repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs. Production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment and any gain or loss on disposal of associated assets. Some of our off-take contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs. In addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants, we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from our sponsor and third-party wood pellet producers.\nDistribution costs include all transportation costs from our plants to our port locations, any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers. Both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our deep-water terminals have allowed for the efficient and cost-effective transportation of our wood pellets. We seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into long-term, fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our off-take contracts pursuant to which we are responsible for arranging shipping. Certain of our off-take contracts include\npricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices, which allow us to pass the majority of the fuel price risk associated with shipping through to our customers.\nAdditionally, as deliveries are made, we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangible assets during the applicable contract term.\nRaw material, production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our owned and leased marine terminals and related- and third-party wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory. Fixed production overhead, including the related depreciation expense, is allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the facilities. These costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold. Distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable acquired customer contracts are expensed as incurred. Our inventory is recorded using the first-in, first-out method ( FIFO\u201d), which requires the use of judgment and estimates. Given the nature of our inventory, the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the FIFO inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe and our General Partner are party to a Management Services Agreement (the MSA\u201d) with Enviva Management.

Enviva Management estimates the percentage of employee salaries and related benefits, third-party costs, office rent and expenses and any other overhead costs to be provided to"}
