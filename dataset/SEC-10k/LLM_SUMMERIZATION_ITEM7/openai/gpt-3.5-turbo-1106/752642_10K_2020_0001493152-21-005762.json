We have implemented remote working arrangements for our non-essential employees. Our IT system and website allow for virtual tours of our homes for sale or rent, online execution of applications and lease agreements, online payment of rent and other tenant actions. With the lifting of shelter-in-place mandates, we are experiencing high demand for our rental homes and our homes for sale, while also experiencing fewer move-outs. We continue to maintain our communities and deliver essential services to our residents while following social distancing protocols.\nWe had suspended the mailing of rent increase notifications in March and April of 2020, which delayed the related rent increases, which would have been effective May 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. This affected May 2020's rental income by approximately $24,000 and June 2020's rental income by an additional $20,000. We subsequently resumed our regular rent increase schedule. We had offered deferred payment plans, as needed, to our residents who have experienced financial hardship related to COVID-19. Approximately 100 residents (less than 1%) have executed these payment plans in 2020. Although the unemployment benefits and the economic stimulus payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act are no longer in effect, many of our residents should benefit from the availability of the $25 billion in federal aid to state and local governments for rental assistance programs, pursuant to the 2021 Consolidated Appropriation Act that was enacted subsequent to year-end. Collections are consistent with pre-pandemic levels and we have collected 98% of December 2020 site and home rent as of today's date.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and dependent on future developments (including the ongoing roll-out of vaccines and their efficacy). We will continue to monitor these rapidly evolving developments and respond in the best interests of our employees, residents and shareholders. At this time, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAccomplishments\nDuring 2020, UMH made substantial progress on multiple fronts - generating solid operating results, achieving strong growth and improving our financial position.

The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 124 manufactured home communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased two manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $7.8 million. These acquisitions added approximately 310 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 124 communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we purchased a community in Alabama and a community in South Carolina. The two communities acquired during 2021 contain a total of 337 homesites and were purchased for a total price of $8.0 million.\nThe Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes and the brokering of home sales and revenue under cable service agreements as well as from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2020, total income increased 12% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2019 and 2020. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 with an average occupancy of 64%. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2019, increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>-36- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of manufactured homes performed well during 2020, increasing by 13% year-over-year. Demand for quality affordable housing remains healthy. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand.\nThe macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. The inability to satisfy down payment requirements, more stringent credit terms, and steadily increasing home prices continue to create hurdles for would-be homebuyers. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2020, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 858 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 39.2% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 94.6% as of December 31, 2020. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates.\nThe Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $103.2 million at December 31, 2020, representing 7.6% of our undepreciated assets (total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's portfolio consisted of 3% REIT preferred stocks and 97% REIT common stocks.\nThe Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowings of $17.6 million under its margin line at 0.75% interest. The Company's weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 4.7% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2020, the Company raised approximately $9.2 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2020, through an At-the-Market Sale Program ( ATM Program\u201d) for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in 2019 (the 2019 Preferred ATM Program\u201d) and a subsequent ATM Program for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in July 2020 (the New Preferred ATM Program\u201d), the Company issued and sold a total of 134,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and 3.8 million shares of our Series D Preferred Stock, generating gross proceeds of $97.8 million and net proceeds of $96.1 million, after offering expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to year end, the Company issued and sold an additional 768,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock at a weighted average price of $24.80 per share under the New Preferred ATM Program, generating gross proceeds of $19.1 million and net proceeds of $18.8 million, after offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also issued and sold 135,000 shares of Common Stock at a weighted average price of $14.60 per share through an ATM Program for our Common Stock (the Common ATM Program\u201d) that we commenced in June 2020, generating gross proceeds of $2.0 million and net proceeds of $1.7 million, after offering expenses.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company redeemed all 3.8 million issued and outstanding shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the $25.00 per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the October 20, 2020 redemption date in an amount of $0.2722 per share, for a total payment of $25.2722 per share, or $96.1 million in the aggregate. The redemption was funded in part with proceeds from a $106 million property financing with Fannie Mae completed in August 2020 and described below.\nThe Company believes that its capital structure, which allows for the ownership of assets using a balanced combination of equity obtained through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and debt, will enhance shareholder returns as the properties appreciate over time.\nDuring August 2020, the Company completed a financing of 28 of its previously unencumbered communities, containing approximately 4,100 sites, through Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. for total proceeds of approximately $106 million. This secured Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) credit facility has a 10-year maturity with a 30-year amortization schedule, with interest at a fixed rate of 2.62%.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $50 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $29.4 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory and $15 million available on our line of credit secured by rental homes and rental homes leases. In addition, we held approximately $103.2 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $17.6 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>-37- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2019 and 2020, we added a total of six manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 1,800 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 63%. We acquired two additional communities subsequent to December 31, 2020. The Company will utilize the rental home program to seek to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties.\nSee PART I, Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company's lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.\nAcquisitions in 2020 and 2019\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>Community </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Acquisition </td> <td> </td> <td>State </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of Sites </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase Price (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of Acres </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupancy at Acquisition </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisitions in 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Camelot Woods </td> <td> </td> <td>July 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>PA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lake Erie Estates </td> <td> </td> <td>September 21, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>NY </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisitions in 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Friendly Village </td> <td> </td> <td>July 3, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New Colony and Fifty\nOne Estates </td> <td> </td> <td>July 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>PA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Northtowne Meadows </td> <td> </td> <td>July 3, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>-38- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nvs. 2019\nRental and related income increased from $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2020, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 and 2019, which had an average occupancy of 64% and 62%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy has increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which is under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,300 rental homes with an occupancy of 94.6%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth.\nCommunity operating expenses remained relatively stable increasing from $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 2%.\nCommunity NOI increased from $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 20%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 47.5% and 44.1%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs, as occupancy rates increase, these expense ratios are expected to continue to improve. Since the Company has the ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\nSales of manufactured homes increased from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. The total number of homes sold was 323 homes in 2020 as compared to 299 homes in 2019. There were 140 new homes sold in 2020 as compared to 135 in 2019. The Company's average sales price was approximately $63,000 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. The gross profit percentage was 29% and 28% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Selling expenses decreased from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. Gain from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) increased from a loss of $290,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a gain of $768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Many of the costs associated with sales, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. The National Association of Realtors reported that in December 2020, sales of existing homes grew 22% from December 2019. Home prices continue their rise as fewer sellers are listing homes and inventories decline. The inherent affordability of our property type becomes more and more apparent, which should result in increased demand. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produce new rental revenue and represent an investment in the upgrading of our communities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 10%. These increases were due to an increase in personnel costs, including an increase in incentive compensation based on FFO metrics and an increase in matching contributions associated with our 401(k) Plan. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-recurring expenses, as a percentage of gross revenue (total income plus interest, dividend and other income) was 6.4% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td>-39- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation expense increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2020 and 2019.\nInterest income increased from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDividend income decreased from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 24%. This decrease was primarily due to reduced dividends from our securities holdings, as many REITs reduced their dividends in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dividends received from our marketable securities investments were at a weighted average yield of approximately 4.7% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value of marketable securities decreased from an unrealized gain of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an unrealized loss of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices in the securities market. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total net unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio.\nInterest expense, including amortization of financing costs, increased from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. This increase was primarily due to the $106 million Fannie Mae credit facility we entered into during August 2020. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $421.5 million during 2020 as compared to approximately $352.4 million during 2019. The weighted average interest rate on mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 3.8% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.1% at December 31, 2019.\nvs. 2018\nRental and related income increased from $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 13%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2019, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases varied depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 82.0% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2019 and 2018, which had an average occupancy of 62% and 79%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy increased from 82.2% at December 31, 2018 to 83.8% at December 31, 2019. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which was under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continued to be strong in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 7,400 rental homes with an occupancy of 92.3%.\nCommunity operating expenses increased from $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 17%. These increases were primarily due to an increase in water and sewer costs, tree removal, rental home expenses and payroll and personnel costs primarily from the acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019 and the increase in rental homes. In addition, we incurred emergency windstorm tree removal expenses totaling $179,000. Also included in community operating expenses was a one-time settlement of $375,000 for a utility billing dispute over a prior 10-year period.\nCommunity NOI increased from $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 10%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 46.5% and 47.5%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company's ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>-40- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of manufactured homes increased from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 14%. The total number of homes sold was 299 homes in 2019 as compared to 295 homes in 2018. There were 135 new homes sold in 2019 as compared to 125 in 2018. The Company's average sales price was approximately $60,000 and $53,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 10%. The gross profit percentage was 28% and 26% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling expenses increased from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 35%. Gain (loss) from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) decreased from a gain of $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a loss of $290,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Many of these costs, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. Management is encouraged by our continued sales growth. The U.S. homeownership rate was 65.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to the U.S. Census. This is down from 69.2% at its peak at the end of 2004.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 8%. This decrease was due to a decrease in incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, as a percentage of gross revenue (total income plus interest, dividend and other income) was 6.3% and 7.3% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDepreciation expense increased from $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 16%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2019 and 2018.\nInterest income increased from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 16%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDividend income decreased from $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 27%. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in dividends from three securities. Dividends received from our marketable securities investments were at a weighted average yield of approximately 6.3% and 7.3% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value of marketable securities increased from an unrealized loss of $(51.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a gain of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had total net unrealized losses of $(25.2) million in its REIT securities portfolio.\nOther income remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense, including amortization of financing costs, increased from $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year, we obtained three new mortgage loans, and assumed two loans in conjunction with acquisitions, totaling $64.3 million. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $352.4 million during 2019 as compared to approximately $318 million during 2018. The weighted average interest rate on its mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 4.1% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 4.3% at December 31, 2018.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>-41- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures that in management's view of the business we believe are meaningful as they allow the investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include Community Net Operating Income ( Community NOI\u201d), Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( FFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Normalized FFO\u201d).\nWe define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.\nThe Company's Community NOI is calculated as follows (in thousands):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rental and Related Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,680 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61,708 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,949 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,847 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,638 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Community NOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( FFO\u201d), which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), excluding extraordinary items, as defined under U.S. GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, and the change in the fair value of marketable securities plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the NAREIT FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation of NAREIT FFO to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of these assets, such as marketable equity securities and include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity securities. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, we have elected to exclude the change in the fair value of marketable securities from our FFO calculation. NAREIT created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders ( Normalized FFO\u201d), as FFO, excluding gains and losses realized on marketable securities investments and certain one-time charges. FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO and Normalized FFO and, accordingly, our FFO and Normalized FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company's financial performance.\nFFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>-42- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121:

Capital Resources\nThe Company operates as a REIT deriving its income primarily from real estate rental operations. The Company's principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company's shareholders, acquisitions, capital improvements, development and expansions of properties, debt service, purchases of manufactured home inventory and rental homes, financing of manufactured home sales and payments of expenses relating to real estate operations. The Company's ability to generate cash adequate to meet these demands is dependent primarily on income from its real estate investments and marketable securities portfolio, the sale of real estate investments and marketable securities, refinancing of mortgage debt, leveraging of real estate investments, availability of bank borrowings or lines of credit, proceeds from the DRIP and access to the capital markets.\nIn addition to cash generated through operations, the Company uses a variety of sources to fund its cash needs, including acquisitions. Specifically, the Company may sell marketable securities from its investment portfolio, borrow on its unsecured credit facility or lines of credit, finance and refinance its properties, and/or raise capital through the DRIP and capital markets. In order to provide financial flexibility to opportunistically access the capital markets, during 2020 the Company implemented both the Common ATM Program and the New Preferred ATM Program. The Common ATM Program allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the Company's Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100 million from time to time to or through the Company's distribution agents. The New Preferred ATM Program allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100 million from time to time to or through the Company's distribution agent.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>-43- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. There is no guarantee that any of these additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant. To the extent that funds or appropriate communities are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions and maintains financial flexibility. Through the 2019 Preferred ATM Program and the New Preferred ATM Program, during 2020 the Company issued and sold a total of 134,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and 3.8 million shares of our Series D Preferred Stock, generating gross proceeds of $97.8 million and net proceeds after offering expenses of $96.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to year end, the Company issued and sold an additional 768,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock at a weighted average price of $24.80 per share under the New Preferred ATM Program, generating gross proceeds of $19.1 million and net proceeds of $18.8 million, after offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued and sold 135,000 shares of Common Stock through the Common ATM Program at a weighted average price of $14.60 per share, generating gross proceeds of $2.0 million and net proceeds of $1.7 million, after offering expenses.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company voluntarily redeemed all 3.8 million issued and outstanding shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the $25.00 per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the October 20, 2020 redemption date in an amount of $0.2722 per share, for a total payment of $25.2722 per share, or $96.1 million. The redemption was funded in part with proceeds from our $106 million Fannie Mae financing completed in August 2020.\nIn addition, the Company has a DRIP in which participants can purchase stock from the Company at a price of approximately 95% of market. During 2020, amounts received, including dividends reinvested of $3.2 million, totaled $9.2 million. Subsequent to year end, the Company announced that it was decreasing the maximum amount of optional cash payments that may be made by participants in the DRIP in any single month from $5,000 to $1,000, unless a request for waiver of such allowable monthly maximum amount has been granted by the Company.\nDuring August 2020, the Company completed a financing of 28 of its previously unencumbered communities, containing approximately 4,100 sites, through Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. for total proceeds of approximately $106 million. This secured Fannie Mae credit facility has a 10-year maturity with a 30-year amortization schedule, with interest at a fixed rate of 2.62%.\nOn November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to expand and extend its existing unsecured revolving credit facility. The Facility is syndicated with two banks led by BMO Capital Markets Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole book runner, with Bank of Montreal as administrative agent, and includes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the sole syndication agent. The Amendment provides for an increase from $50 million in available borrowings to $75 million in available borrowings with a $50 million accordion feature, bringing the total potential availability up to $125 million, subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from additional lenders. The Amendment also extends the maturity date of the Facility from March 27, 2020 to November 29, 2022, with a one-year extension available at the Company's option, subject to certain conditions including payment of an extension fee. Availability under the Facility is limited to 60% of the value of the unencumbered communities which the Company has placed in the Facility's unencumbered asset pool. The Amendment increased the value of the Borrowing Base communities by reducing the capitalization rate applied to the Net Operating Income generated by the communities in the Borrowing Base from 7.5% to 7.0%. Subsequent to year end, the capitalization rate was further reduced from 7.0% to 6.5%. As of December 31, 2020, $30 million was available on this credit facility.\nThe Company also has the ability to finance home sales, inventory purchases and rental home purchases. The Company has a $20 million revolving line of credit for the financing of homes, of which $6 million was utilized at December 31, 2020, and revolving credit facilities totaling $28.5 million to finance inventory purchases, of which $13.1 million was utilized at December 31, 2020. During 2020, the Company also entered into a new $20 million revolving line of credit (expandable to $30 million) secured by rental homes and rental home leases in several of our manufactured home communities, of which $5 million was utilized at December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $15.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $103.2 million encumbered by $17.6 million in margin loans. The Company owned 124 communities of which 20 are unencumbered. The Company's marketable securities and non-mortgaged properties provide us with additional liquidity. The Company believes that cash on hand, funds generated from operations, the DRIP and capital market, the funds available on the lines of credit, together with the ability to finance and refinance its properties will provide sufficient funds to adequately meet its obligations over the next several years.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>-44- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's focus is on real estate investments. The Company has historically financed purchases of real estate primarily through mortgages. During 2020, total investment property, including rental homes, increased 9% or $93.2 million. The Company made acquisitions of two manufactured home communities totaling approximately 310 developed sites at an aggregate purchase price of $7.8 million. These acquisitions were funded by assuming the existing mortgages and the use of our unsecured credit facility. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related debt transactions. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities. The funds for these acquisitions may come from bank borrowings, proceeds from the DRIP, and private placements or public offerings of common or preferred stock, including under the Common ATM Program or New Preferred ATM Program. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.\nThe Company owned approximately 8,300 rental homes, or approximately 35% of our total homesites ad of December 31, 2020. During 2020, our rental home portfolio increased by 858 homes or $52.5 million. The Company markets these rental homes for sale to existing residents. The Company estimates that in 2021 it will purchase approximately 900 manufactured homes to use as rental units for a total cost, including setup, of approximately $45 million. Rental home rates on new homes range from approximately $650-$1,500 per month, including lot rent, depending on size, location and market conditions. During 2020, the Company also invested approximately $24 million in other improvements to our communities.\nAdditionally, the Company has investments in marketable debt and equity securities of other REITs. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional liquidity and income and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets. During 2020, the securities portfolio decreased 11% or $13.0 million primarily due to a net unrealized loss of $14.1 million partially offset by purchases of $1.1 million. The Company had dividend income earned of $5.7 million. The Company from time to time may purchase these securities on margin when there is an adequate yield spread. At December 31, 2020, $17.6 million was outstanding on the margin loan at a 0.75% interest rate.\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103,770 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(122,350 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(137,603 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,314 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash\nEquivalents and Restricted Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,114 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $30.5 million in 2020 to $69.0 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Community NOI and a decrease in inventory in 2020 compared to an increase in 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively stable from 2018 to 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $18.6 million in 2020 and $15.3 million in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of manufactured home communities and, in 2019, a decrease in purchases of REIT securities.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $45.7 million in 2020 to $44.3 million. The Company obtained new mortgages of $106 million. The Company also received $9.2 million, including dividends reinvested, through the DRIP. In addition, in 2020 the Company issued and sold 134,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock and 3.8 million shares of its Series D Preferred Stock through the 2019 Preferred ATM Program and the New Preferred ATM Program, raising net proceeds during 2020 of approximately $96.1 million. The Company also issued and sold 135,000 shares of its Common Stock through the Common ATM Program, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million. In October 2020, the Company voluntarily redeemed all of its Series B Preferred Stock for approximately $96.1 million. During 2020, the Company also distributed to our common shareholders a total of $29.8 million, including dividends reinvested.

In addition, in 2019 the Company issued and sold 651,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock through the 2019 Preferred ATM Program, raising net proceeds of approximately $15.9 million. During 2019, the Company also distributed to our common shareholders a total of $28.8 million, including dividends reinvested. In addition, the Company also paid $25.7 million in preferred dividends.\nCash flows were primarily used for purchases of manufactured home communities, capital improvements, payment of dividends, purchases of marketable securities, purchase of inventory and rental homes, loans to customers for the sales of manufactured homes, and expansion of existing communities. The Company meets maturing mortgage obligations by using a combination of cash flows and refinancing. The dividend payments were primarily made from cash flows from operations.\nCash flows used for capital improvements include amounts needed to meet environmental and regulatory requirements in connection with the manufactured home communities that provide water or sewer service. Excluding expansions and rental home purchases, the Company is budgeting approximately $12 million in capital improvements for 2021.\nThe Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations relate to its mortgages and loans payable, acquisitions of manufactured home communities, retirement benefits, and the lease on its corporate offices as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 and related actions impact our operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments (including the ongoing roll-out of vaccines and their efficacy), which cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence, including the scope, severity, duration and geographies of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or mitigate its impact requested or mandated by governmental authorities or otherwise voluntarily taken by individuals or businesses, the success of governmental actions undertaken to support the economy during the pandemic and the duration and severity of direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. As previously discussed, at this time, we believe that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Company has 1,800 acres of undeveloped land which it could develop over the next several years. The Company continues to analyze the best use of its vacant land.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had total assets of $1.1 billion and total liabilities of $585.4 million. Our net debt (net of cash and cash equivalents) to total market capitalization as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately 34% and 29%, respectively. Our net debt, less securities (net of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities) to total market capitalization as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately 28% and 22%, respectively.\nThe Company believes that it has the ability to meet its obligations and to generate funds for new investments.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>-46- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nThe Company has not executed any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgages Payable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest on Mortgages Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,727 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest on Loans Payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase of Properties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Retirement Benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>669,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMortgages payable represents the principal amounts outstanding based on scheduled payments. The interest on these mortgages are at fixed rates ranging from 2.62% to 6.5%. The weighted average interest rate, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was approximately 3.8% at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average loan maturity of the mortgage payable is 6.0 years.\nLoans payable represents $45 million outstanding on the Company's unsecured line of credit with an interest rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.20% or Prime plus 0.50% to 1.20%, based on the Company's overall leverage (interest rate of 1.65% as of December 31, 2020); $17.6 million outstanding on its margin line with an interest rate of 0.75% at December 31, 2020; $13.1 million outstanding on the Company's revolving credit agreements to finance inventory with interest rates ranging from 4.15% to prime with a minimum of 6% (weighted average interest rate of 4.44% as of December 31, 2020); $5.0 million outstanding on its revolving line of credit secured by rental homes and rental home leases with an interest rate of prime plus 25 basis points with a floor of 3.5% (interest rate of 3.50% at December 31, 2020); $6.0 million outstanding on the Company's revolving line of credit secured by eligible notes receivables with an interest rate of prime with a floor of 3.25% (interest rate of 3.25% as of December 31, 2020); and $658,000 outstanding on its automotive loans with a weighted average interest rate of 4.22%.\nOperating lease obligations represent a lease with a related party for the Company's corporate offices. On October 1, 2019, the Company entered into a new lease for its executive offices which combines the existing corporate office space with additional adjacent office space. This new lease extends our existing lease through April 30, 2027 and requires monthly lease payments of $23,098 through April 30, 2022 and $23,302 from May 1, 2022 through April 30, 2027. The Company is also responsible for its proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance. Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, owns a 24% interest in the entity that is the landlord of the property where the Company's corporate office space is located. Management believes that the aforesaid rent is no more than what the Company would pay for comparable space elsewhere.\nPurchase of properties represents the total purchase price of two communities under contract as of December 31, 2020, one in Alabama and one in South Carolina, totaling 337 developed home sites. The Company completed the acquisitions of these properties in January 2021.\nRetirement benefits of $400,000 represent the total future amount to be paid, on an undiscounted basis, relating to the Company's Founder and Chairman. These benefits are based upon his specific employment agreement. The agreement does not require the Company to separately fund the obligation and therefore it will be paid from the general assets of the Company. The Company has accrued these benefits on a present value basis over the term of the agreement (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>-47- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSignificant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policy is affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. For a detailed description of this and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nImpairment in Real Estate Investments\nThe Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360-10, Property, Plant & Equipment ( ASC 360-10\u201d) to measure impairment in real estate investments. Rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis without interest) from a rental property is less than the carrying value under its historical net cost basis. These expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. Upon determination that an other than temporary impairment has occurred, rental properties are reduced to their fair value. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and/or it is actively being marketed for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less its cost to sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>-48- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company conducted a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-21, which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The process entailed the analysis of property for instances where the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value. In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-17, an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its internal valuation team to derive certain assumptions used to determine an operating property's cash flow. Such assumptions include lease-up rates, rental rates, rental growth rates, and capital expenditures. The Company reviewed its operating properties in light of the requirements of ASC 360-10 and determined that, as of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted cash flows over the holding period for these properties were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charges were required.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "The report discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and management's response.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe following discussion is intended to provide certain information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and management's efforts to respond to those impacts.\nWe continue to closely monitor our operations and government recommendations and have taken steps to make the safety, security and welfare of our employees, their families and our residents a top priority.\nWe have complied with government stay-at-home\u201d orders and social distancing\u201d practices. We have implemented remote working arrangements for our non-essential employees. Our IT system and website allow for virtual tours of our homes for sale or rent, online execution of applications and lease agreements, online payment of rent and other tenant actions. With the lifting of shelter-in-place mandates, we are experiencing high demand for our rental homes and our homes for sale, while also experiencing fewer move-outs. We continue to maintain our communities and deliver essential services to our residents while following social distancing protocols.\nWe had suspended the mailing of rent increase notifications in March and April of 2020, which delayed the related rent increases, which would have been effective May 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. This affected May 2020's rental income by approximately $24,000 and June 2020's rental income by an additional $20,000. We subsequently resumed our regular rent increase schedule. We had offered deferred payment plans, as needed, to our residents who have experienced financial hardship related to COVID-19. Approximately 100 residents (less than 1%) have executed these payment plans in 2020. Although the unemployment benefits and the economic stimulus payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act are no longer in effect, many of our residents should benefit from the availability of the $25 billion in federal aid to state and local governments for rental assistance programs, pursuant to the 2021 Consolidated Appropriation Act that was enacted subsequent to year-end. Collections are consistent with pre-pandemic levels and we have collected 98% of December 2020 site and home rent as of today's date.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and dependent on future developments (including the ongoing roll-out of vaccines and their efficacy). We will continue to monitor these rapidly evolving developments and respond in the best interests of our employees, residents and shareholders. At this time, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAccomplishments\nDuring 2020, UMH made substantial progress on multiple fronts - generating solid operating results, achieving strong growth and improving our financial position.

The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 124 manufactured home communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased two manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $7.8 million. These acquisitions added approximately 310 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 124 communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we purchased a community in Alabama and a community in South Carolina. The two communities acquired during 2021 contain a total of 337 homesites and were purchased for a total price of $8.0 million.\nThe Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes and the brokering of home sales and revenue under cable service agreements as well as from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2020, total income increased 12% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2019 and 2020. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 with an average occupancy of 64%. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2019, increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020.\n -36- \n \nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of manufactured homes performed well during 2020, increasing by 13% year-over-year. Demand for quality affordable housing remains healthy. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand.\nThe macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. The inability to satisfy down payment requirements, more stringent credit terms, and steadily increasing home prices continue to create hurdles for would-be homebuyers. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2020, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 858 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 39.2% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 94.6% as of December 31, 2020. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates.\nThe Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $103.2 million at December 31, 2020, representing 7.6% of our undepreciated assets (total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's portfolio consisted of 3% REIT preferred stocks and 97% REIT common stocks.\nThe Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowings of $17.6 million under its margin line at 0.75% interest. The Company's weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 4.7% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2020, the Company raised approximately $9.2 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2020, through an At-the-Market Sale Program ( ATM Program\u201d) for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in 2019 (the 2019 Preferred ATM Program\u201d) and a subsequent ATM Program for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in July 2020 (the New Preferred ATM Program\u201d), the Company issued and sold a total of 134,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and 3.8 million shares of our Series D Preferred Stock, generating gross proceeds of $97.8 million and net proceeds of $96.1 million, after offering expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to year end, the Company issued and sold an additional 768,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock at a weighted average price of $24.80 per share under the New Preferred ATM Program, generating gross proceeds of $19.1 million and net proceeds of $18.8 million, after offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also issued and sold 135,000 shares of Common Stock at a weighted average price of $14.60 per share through an ATM Program for our Common Stock (the Common ATM Program\u201d) that we commenced in June 2020, generating gross proceeds of $2.0 million and net proceeds of $1.7 million, after offering expenses.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company redeemed all 3.8 million issued and outstanding shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the $25.00 per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the October 20, 2020 redemption date in an amount of $0.2722 per share, for a total payment of $25.2722 per share, or $96.1 million in the aggregate. The redemption was funded in part with proceeds from a $106 million property financing with Fannie Mae completed in August 2020 and described below.\nThe Company believes that its capital structure, which allows for the ownership of assets using a balanced combination of equity obtained through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and debt, will enhance shareholder returns as the properties appreciate over time.\nDuring August 2020, the Company completed a financing of 28 of its previously unencumbered communities, containing approximately 4,100 sites, through Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. for total proceeds of approximately $106 million. This secured Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) credit facility has a 10-year maturity with a 30-year amortization schedule, with interest at a fixed rate of 2.62%.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $50 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $29.4 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory and $15 million available on our line of credit secured by rental homes and rental homes leases. In addition, we held approximately $103.2 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $17.6 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities.\n -37- \n \nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2019 and 2020, we added a total of six manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 1,800 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 63%. We acquired two additional communities subsequent to December 31, 2020. The Company will utilize the rental home program to seek to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties.\nSee PART I, Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company's lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.\nAcquisitions in 2020 and 2019\n\n -38- \n \nResults of Operations\nvs. 2019\nRental and related income increased from $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2020, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 and 2019, which had an average occupancy of 64% and 62%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy has increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which is under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,300 rental homes with an occupancy of 94.6%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth.\nCommunity operating expenses remained relatively stable increasing from $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 2%.\nCommunity NOI increased from $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 20%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 47.5% and 44.1%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs, as occupancy rates increase, these expense ratios are expected to continue to improve. Since the Company has the ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\nSales of manufactured homes increased from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. The total number of homes sold was 323 homes in 2020 as compared to 299 homes in 2019. There were 140 new homes sold in 2020 as compared to 135 in 2019. The Company's average sales price was approximately $63,000 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. The gross profit percentage was 29% and 28% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Selling expenses decreased from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. Gain from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) increased from a loss of $290,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a gain of $768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Many of the costs associated with sales, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. The National Association of Realtors reported that in December 2020, sales of existing homes grew 22% from December 2019. Home prices continue their rise as fewer sellers are listing homes and inventories decline. The inherent affordability of our property type becomes more and more apparent, which should result in increased demand. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produce new rental revenue and represent an investment in the upgrading of our communities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 10%. These increases were due to an increase in personnel costs, including an increase in incentive compensation based on FFO metrics and an increase in matching contributions associated with our 401(k) Plan. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-recurring expenses, as a percentage of gross revenue (total income plus interest, dividend and other income) was 6.4% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n -39- \n \nDepreciation expense increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2020 and 2019.\nInterest income increased from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDividend income decreased from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 24%. This decrease was primarily due to reduced dividends from our securities holdings, as many REITs reduced their dividends in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dividends received from our marketable securities investments were at a weighted average yield of approximately 4.7% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value of marketable securities decreased from an unrealized gain of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an unrealized loss of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices in the securities market. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total net unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio.\nInterest expense, including amortization of financing costs, increased from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. This increase was primarily due to the $106 million Fannie Mae credit facility we entered into during August 2020. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $421.5 million during 2020 as compared to approximately $352.4 million during 2019. The weighted average interest rate on mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 3.8% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.1% at December 31, 2019.\nvs. 2018\nRental and related income increased from $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 13%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2019, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases varied depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 82.0% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2019 and 2018, which had an average occupancy of 62% and 79%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy increased from 82.2% at December 31, 2018 to 83.8% at December 31, 2019. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which was under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continued to be strong in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 7,400 rental homes with an occupancy of 92.3%.\nCommunity operating expenses increased from $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 17%. These increases were primarily due to an increase in water and sewer costs, tree removal, rental home expenses and payroll and personnel costs primarily from the acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019 and the increase in rental homes. In addition, we incurred emergency windstorm tree removal expenses totaling $179,000. Also included in community operating expenses was a one-time settlement of $375,000 for a utility billing dispute over a prior 10-year period.\nCommunity NOI increased from $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 10%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 46.5% and 47.5%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company's ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\n -40- \n \nSales of manufactured homes increased from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $18 million for the year ended December 31,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe following discussion is intended to provide certain information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and management's efforts to respond to those impacts.\nWe continue to closely monitor our operations and government recommendations and have taken steps to make the safety, security and welfare of our employees, their families and our residents a top priority.\nWe have complied with government stay-at-home\u201d orders and social distancing\u201d practices. We have implemented remote working arrangements for our non-essential employees. Our IT system and website allow for virtual tours of our homes for sale or rent, online execution of applications and lease agreements, online payment of rent and other tenant actions. With the lifting of shelter-in-place mandates, we are experiencing high demand for our rental homes and our homes for sale, while also experiencing fewer move-outs. We continue to maintain our communities and deliver essential services to our residents while following social distancing protocols.\nWe had suspended the mailing of rent increase notifications in March and April of 2020, which delayed the related rent increases, which would have been effective May 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. This affected May 2020's rental income by approximately $24,000 and June 2020's rental income by an additional $20,000. We subsequently resumed our regular rent increase schedule. We had offered deferred payment plans, as needed, to our residents who have experienced financial hardship related to COVID-19. Approximately 100 residents (less than 1%) have executed these payment plans in 2020. Although the unemployment benefits and the economic stimulus payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act are no longer in effect, many of our residents should benefit from the availability of the $25 billion in federal aid to state and local governments for rental assistance programs, pursuant to the 2021 Consolidated Appropriation Act that was enacted subsequent to year-end. Collections are consistent with pre-pandemic levels and we have collected 98% of December 2020 site and home rent as of today's date.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and dependent on future developments (including the ongoing roll-out of vaccines and their efficacy). We will continue to monitor these rapidly evolving developments and respond in the best interests of our employees, residents and shareholders. At this time, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAccomplishments\nDuring 2020, UMH made substantial progress on multiple fronts - generating solid operating results, achieving strong growth and improving our financial position.

The Company's primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 124 manufactured home communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased two manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $7.8 million. These acquisitions added approximately 310 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 124 communities containing approximately 23,400 developed homesites as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we purchased a community in Alabama and a community in South Carolina. The two communities acquired during 2021 contain a total of 337 homesites and were purchased for a total price of $8.0 million.\nThe Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes and the brokering of home sales and revenue under cable service agreements as well as from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital and resources. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets.\nOccupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2020, total income increased 12% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2019 and 2020. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 with an average occupancy of 64%. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2019, increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020.\n -36- \n \nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of manufactured homes performed well during 2020, increasing by 13% year-over-year. Demand for quality affordable housing remains healthy. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand.\nThe macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. The inability to satisfy down payment requirements, more stringent credit terms, and steadily increasing home prices continue to create hurdles for would-be homebuyers. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2020, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 858 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 39.2% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 94.6% as of December 31, 2020. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates.\nThe Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $103.2 million at December 31, 2020, representing 7.6% of our undepreciated assets (total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's portfolio consisted of 3% REIT preferred stocks and 97% REIT common stocks.\nThe Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowings of $17.6 million under its margin line at 0.75% interest. The Company's weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 4.7% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis.\nThe Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2020, the Company raised approximately $9.2 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2020, through an At-the-Market Sale Program ( ATM Program\u201d) for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in 2019 (the 2019 Preferred ATM Program\u201d) and a subsequent ATM Program for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that we commenced in July 2020 (the New Preferred ATM Program\u201d), the Company issued and sold a total of 134,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock and 3.8 million shares of our Series D Preferred Stock, generating gross proceeds of $97.8 million and net proceeds of $96.1 million, after offering expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to year end, the Company issued and sold an additional 768,000 shares of its Series D Preferred Stock at a weighted average price of $24.80 per share under the New Preferred ATM Program, generating gross proceeds of $19.1 million and net proceeds of $18.8 million, after offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also issued and sold 135,000 shares of Common Stock at a weighted average price of $14.60 per share through an ATM Program for our Common Stock (the Common ATM Program\u201d) that we commenced in June 2020, generating gross proceeds of $2.0 million and net proceeds of $1.7 million, after offering expenses.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company redeemed all 3.8 million issued and outstanding shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the $25.00 per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the October 20, 2020 redemption date in an amount of $0.2722 per share, for a total payment of $25.2722 per share, or $96.1 million in the aggregate. The redemption was funded in part with proceeds from a $106 million property financing with Fannie Mae completed in August 2020 and described below.\nThe Company believes that its capital structure, which allows for the ownership of assets using a balanced combination of equity obtained through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and debt, will enhance shareholder returns as the properties appreciate over time.\nDuring August 2020, the Company completed a financing of 28 of its previously unencumbered communities, containing approximately 4,100 sites, through Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. for total proceeds of approximately $106 million. This secured Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) credit facility has a 10-year maturity with a 30-year amortization schedule, with interest at a fixed rate of 2.62%.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $50 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $29.4 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory and $15 million available on our line of credit secured by rental homes and rental homes leases. In addition, we held approximately $103.2 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $17.6 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities.\n -37- \n \nThe Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2019 and 2020, we added a total of six manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 1,800 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 63%. We acquired two additional communities subsequent to December 31, 2020. The Company will utilize the rental home program to seek to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company's investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties.\nSee PART I, Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company's lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.\nAcquisitions in 2020 and 2019\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>Community </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Acquisition </td> <td> </td> <td>State </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of Sites </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase Price (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of Acres </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupancy at Acquisition </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisitions in 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Camelot Woods </td> <td> </td> <td>July 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>PA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lake Erie Estates </td> <td> </td> <td>September 21, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>NY </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisitions in 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Friendly Village </td> <td> </td> <td>July 3, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>New Colony and Fifty\nOne Estates </td> <td> </td> <td>July 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>PA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Northtowne Meadows </td> <td> </td> <td>July 3, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>OH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n -38- \n \nResults of Operations\nvs. 2019\nRental and related income increased from $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2020, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 85.0% and 82.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2020 and 2019, which had an average occupancy of 64% and 62%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy has increased from 83.6% at December 31, 2019 to 86.8% at December 31, 2020. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which is under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,300 rental homes with an occupancy of 94.6%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth.\nCommunity operating expenses remained relatively stable increasing from $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 2%.\nCommunity NOI increased from $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 20%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2020 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 47.5% and 44.1%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs, as occupancy rates increase, these expense ratios are expected to continue to improve. Since the Company has the ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\nSales of manufactured homes increased from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. The total number of homes sold was 323 homes in 2020 as compared to 299 homes in 2019. There were 140 new homes sold in 2020 as compared to 135 in 2019. The Company's average sales price was approximately $63,000 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. The gross profit percentage was 29% and 28% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Selling expenses decreased from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. Gain from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) increased from a loss of $290,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a gain of $768,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Many of the costs associated with sales, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. The National Association of Realtors reported that in December 2020, sales of existing homes grew 22% from December 2019. Home prices continue their rise as fewer sellers are listing homes and inventories decline. The inherent affordability of our property type becomes more and more apparent, which should result in increased demand. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produce new rental revenue and represent an investment in the upgrading of our communities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 10%. These increases were due to an increase in personnel costs, including an increase in incentive compensation based on FFO metrics and an increase in matching contributions associated with our 401(k) Plan. General and administrative expenses, excluding non-recurring expenses, as a percentage of gross revenue (total income plus interest, dividend and other income) was 6.4% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n -39- \n \nDepreciation expense increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 13%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2020 and 2019.\nInterest income increased from $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 11%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDividend income decreased from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 24%. This decrease was primarily due to reduced dividends from our securities holdings, as many REITs reduced their dividends in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dividends received from our marketable securities investments were at a weighted average yield of approximately 4.7% and 6.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value of marketable securities decreased from an unrealized gain of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to an unrealized loss of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices in the securities market. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total net unrealized losses of $39.4 million in its REIT securities portfolio.\nInterest expense, including amortization of financing costs, increased from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 3%. This increase was primarily due to the $106 million Fannie Mae credit facility we entered into during August 2020. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $421.5 million during 2020 as compared to approximately $352.4 million during 2019. The weighted average interest rate on mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 3.8% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 4.1% at December 31, 2019.\nvs. 2018\nRental and related income increased from $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 13%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2019, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases varied depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy was 82.0% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2019 and 2018, which had an average occupancy of 62% and 79%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy increased from 82.2% at December 31, 2018 to 83.8% at December 31, 2019. The same property occupancy rate is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which was under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continued to be strong in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 7,400 rental homes with an occupancy of 92.3%.\nCommunity operating expenses increased from $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 17%. These increases were primarily due to an increase in water and sewer costs, tree removal, rental home expenses and payroll and personnel costs primarily from the acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019 and the increase in rental homes. In addition, we incurred emergency windstorm tree removal expenses totaling $179,000. Also included in community operating expenses was a one-time settlement of $375,000 for a utility billing dispute over a prior 10-year period.\nCommunity NOI increased from $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 10%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 46.5% and 47.5%, excluding non-recurring operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Many recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company's ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations.\n -40- \n \nSales of manufactured homes increased from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $18 million for the year ended December 31,"}
