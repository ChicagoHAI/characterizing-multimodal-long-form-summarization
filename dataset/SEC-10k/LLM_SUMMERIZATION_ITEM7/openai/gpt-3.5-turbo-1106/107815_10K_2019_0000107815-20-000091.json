MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nPrior to April 1, 2019, we provided electric service to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This customer was transferred to UMERC on April 1, 2019 after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.\nReshaping Our Generation Fleet\nWEC Energy Group has developed and is executing a plan to reshape its generation portfolio. This plan balances reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation. In 2019, WEC Energy Group met and exceeded its 2030 goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels, and is re-evaluating its longer-term CO2 reduction goals. WEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018 across its electric utilities, and expects to continue adding natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. This plan included the March 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for information related to the plant retirements as part of WEC Energy Group's plan.\nAs part of WEC Energy Group's commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we, along with an unaffiliated utility filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed utility-scale solar project, Badger Hollow Solar Farm II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to our receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of the output of this project. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow Solar Farm II is targeted for the end of 2021.\nIn December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, in 2019, we constructed 5 MW of solar generation and we expect to construct more than double that amount in 2020. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that we would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\nAs the cost of renewable energy generation continues to decline, these pilot programs and the utility-scale solar project have become cost effective opportunities for us and our customers to participate in renewable energy.\nWEC Energy Group also has a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in its network by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. WEC Energy Group was over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\noperating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies being recognized in 2019 by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, as the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the ninth year in a row. We Energies is the trade name under which we and WG, another wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, operate.\nWe plan to construct an additional LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, the facility would provide us with approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. The facility is expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on our natural gas system during the highest demand days of winter. Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating resources of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We also strive to provide the best value to our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by embracing constructive change, leveraging capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 2, Disposition, for information on the sale of Bostco's remaining real estate holdings.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018.

The table above shows the income statement impacts associated with the flow through of tax repairs beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019. As shown in the table above, the changes related to these items had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder, but did significantly impact our operating income. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the flow through of tax repairs and Note 12, Leases, for more information on the adoption of Topic 842. See below for additional information on the $3.8 million increase in consolidated earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the operating income contribution of our utility segment and includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $760.2 million and $402.5 million, respectively. The operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to utility segment operating

Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.\nWe maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See Note 10, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on our credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 11, Long-Term Debt, for more information.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking Capital\nAlthough not the case as of December 31, 2019, our current liabilities sometimes exceed our current assets. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.\nCredit Rating Risk\nWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S&P Global Ratings and/or Baa3 at Moody's Investors Service. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the legislation could result in credit rating agencies placing our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrading our credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility.\nCapital Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,246.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>519.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,081.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,225.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>785.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,239.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and transportation purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,627.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>782.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,517.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,360.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,967.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and OPEB funding obligations (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,507.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,471.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,966.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,715.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,355.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Principal and interest payments on long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Finance lease obligations for power purchase commitments and the leases with We Power.

We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities.\nAROs in the amount of $65.0 million are not included in the above table. Settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years. See Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nObligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.\nSignificant Capital Projects\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, impacts from the Tax Legislation, additional changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>701.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,189.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of spending consists of upgrading our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the AMI program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\nAdditionally, as part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we, along with an unaffiliated utility filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed utility-scale solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to our receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of the output of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be $130 million. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for the end of 2021. Solar generation technology has greatly improved, has become more cost-effective, and it complements our summer demand curve.\nWe plan to construct a LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, the facility would provide us with approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. The facility is expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on our natural gas system during the highest demand days of winter. The project is estimated to cost approximately $185 million. Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nCommon Stock Matters\nFor information related to our common stock matters, see Note 8, Common Equity.\nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain OPEB obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We contributed $5.5 million and $6.3 million to our pension and OPEB plans in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. For additional information, see Note 16, Employee Benefits.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including letters of credit that primarily support our commodity contracts. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(p), Guarantees, Note 10, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 18, Variable Interest Entities, for more information.\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\nRegulatory Recovery\nWe account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by the PSCW. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on our rates. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for additional information regarding recent rate proceedings and orders.\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. In general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to twenty years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, our regulatory assets were $2,755.2 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $1,756.2 million.\nDue to the Tax Legislation, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $1,102 million. We have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through bill credits and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See Note 13, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information on our mechanism that allows for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.\nWeather\nOur utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nseason. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2019 and 2018, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt.\nBased on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $1.2 million and $1.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by the PSCW.\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Return on Assets in 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,094.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPEB trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\nWEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\nInflation\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.\nFor additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nDue to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a third-party supplier or us. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates.\nWe offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. We offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. We are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\nOther Matters\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. In May 2018, the PSCW issued a written order regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers in Wisconsin. The various remaining impacts of the Tax Legislation on our Wisconsin operations were addressed in our recent rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our rate orders. In addition, the MPSC approved a settlement in May 2018 with Tilden that addressed all base rate impacts of the Tax Legislation. Tilden owns the iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that we provided retail electric service to prior to April 1, 2019. We are also working with the FERC to modify our formula rate tariff for the impacts of the Tax Legislation, and we expect to receive FERC approval for the modified tariff in 2020.\nBonus Depreciation Provisions\nBonus depreciation is an additional amount of first-year tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. The bonus depreciation deduction available for public utility property subject to rate-making by a government entity or public utility commission was modified by the Tax Legislation. Based on the provisions of the Tax Legislation, bonus depreciation can no longer be deducted for public utility property acquired and placed in service after December 31, 2017.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.\nThe following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. As of December 31, 2019, we had $2,755.2 million in regulatory assets and $1,756.2 million in regulatory liabilities. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. Long-lived assets that would be subject to an impairment assessment would generally include any assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future.\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery or a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.\nPleasant Prairie power plant was retired during 2018. PIPP was retired during 2019. Effective with our rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019, we received approval to collect a return of and on the entire net book value of the PIPP and we received approval to collect a full return of and on all but $100 million of the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. In accordance with our\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPSCW rate order received in December 2019, we will seek a financing order from the PSCW to securitize the remaining $100 million. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 16, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.

From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.00% in 2019, 2018, and 2017. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 15.83%, (2.91)%, and 11.48%, in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered.

However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2019 of approximately $3.5 billion included accrued utility revenues of $205.6 million as of December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(m), Income Taxes, and Note 13, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial performance and corporate developments of Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nPrior to April 1, 2019, we provided electric service to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This customer was transferred to UMERC on April 1, 2019 after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.\nReshaping Our Generation Fleet\nWEC Energy Group has developed and is executing a plan to reshape its generation portfolio. This plan balances reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation. In 2019, WEC Energy Group met and exceeded its 2030 goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels, and is re-evaluating its longer-term CO2 reduction goals. WEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018 across its electric utilities, and expects to continue adding natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. This plan included the March 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for information related to the plant retirements as part of WEC Energy Group's plan.\nAs part of WEC Energy Group's commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we, along with an unaffiliated utility filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed utility-scale solar project, Badger Hollow Solar Farm II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to our receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of the output of this project. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow Solar Farm II is targeted for the end of 2021.\nIn December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, in 2019, we constructed 5 MW of solar generation and we expect to construct more than double that amount in 2020. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that we would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\nAs the cost of renewable energy generation continues to decline, these pilot programs and the utility-scale solar project have become cost effective opportunities for us and our customers to participate in renewable energy.\nWEC Energy Group also has a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in its network by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. WEC Energy Group was over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to\n\noperating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies being recognized in 2019 by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, as the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the ninth year in a row. We Energies is the trade name under which we and WG, another wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, operate.\nWe plan to construct an additional LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, the facility would provide us with approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. The facility is expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on our natural gas system during the highest demand days of winter. Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating resources of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We also strive to provide the best value to our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by embracing constructive change, leveraging capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 2, Disposition, for information on the sale of Bostco's remaining real estate holdings.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018. For a similar discussion that compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations in Part II of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nConsolidated Earnings\nThe following table compares our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018, including favorable or better, \"B\", and unfavorable or worse, \"W\", variances:\n\nOur consolidated earnings increased $3.8 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The table above shows the income statement impacts associated with the flow through of tax repairs beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019. As shown in the table above, the changes related to these items had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder, but did significantly impact our operating income. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the flow through of tax repairs and Note 12, Leases, for more information on the adoption of Topic 842. See below for additional information on the $3.8 million increase in consolidated earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the operating income contribution of our utility segment and includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $760.2 million and $402.5 million, respectively. The operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to utility segment operating income.\n\nUtility Segment Contribution to Operating Income\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:\n\n (1) Represents costs associated with the We Power generation units, including operating and maintenance costs we incurred. During 2018, the amount also included the lease payments that were billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates. We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019, which revised the previous guidance regarding the accounting for leases. As a result of this adoption, during 2019, $363.3 million of lease expense related to the We Power leases was no longer classified within other operation and maintenance, but was instead recorded as $15.8 million and $347.5 million of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, respectively, in accordance with Topic 842. \nDuring 2019, $134.8 million of operating and maintenance costs were billed to or incurred by us related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset. During 2018, $485.3 million of both lease and operating and maintenance costs were billed to or incurred by us related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.\n (2) Represents transmission expense that we are authorized to collect in rates, in accordance with the PSCW's approval of escrow accounting for our ATC and MISO network transmission expenses. As a result, we defer as a regulatory asset or liability the differences between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. During 2019 and 2018, $329.4 million and $286.3 million, respectively, of costs were billed to us by transmission providers. \n (3) Represents additional transmission expense associated with the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities starting in 2018, in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW, to maintain certain regulatory asset balances at their December 31, 2017 levels. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. The decrease in transmission expense associated with the flow through of tax benefits is offset in income taxes. \n (4) Represents additional transmission expense associated with the May 2018 PSCW order requiring us to use 80% of our current 2018 tax benefit, including the amortization associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes, to reduce our transmission regulatory asset balance. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n\n (5) Regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income. \n (6) See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information about our earnings sharing mechanism. \nThe following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:\n\n\n\n * Normal degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \n2019 Compared with 2018\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $61.7 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n \u2022 A $40.9 million decrease in margins related to lower sales volumes, primarily driven by cooler summer weather during 2019 compared with 2018. As measured by cooling degree days, 2019 was 21.7% cooler than 2018. \n \u2022 A $13.7 million decrease in margins associated with the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities starting in 2018 in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW to maintain certain regulatory assets at their December 31, 2017 levels. This decrease in margins was offset in income taxes. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n\n \u2022 An $11.3 million decrease in margins related to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tilden, who was our customer, became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019. \nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $4.8 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was higher sales volumes, due in part to colder winter weather, customer growth, and higher use per retail customer during 2019, compared with 2018. As measured by heating degree days, 2019 was 2.2% colder than 2018.\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment increased $357.7 million during 2019, compared with 2018. This increase was driven by $414.6 million of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes), partially offset by the $56.9 million net decrease in margins discussed above.\nThe utility segment experienced lower overall operating expenses related to efficiencies and effective cost control. The other significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses during 2019, compared with 2018, were:\n \u2022 A $363.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense resulting from the adoption of the new lease guidance. As discussed under the other operation and maintenance table above, the adoption of Topic 842, effective January 1, 2019, required us to change the income statement classification of our lease payments related to the We Power leases. During 2019, the lease expense related to the We Power leases was no longer classified within other operation and maintenance, but was instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 842. \n \u2022 A $70.0 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by lower maintenance and labor costs associated with our 2019 and 2018 plant retirements, and increases to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in our December 2019 Wisconsin rate order. Plant retirements included the 2019 retirement of the PIPP and the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the plant retirements. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our Wisconsin rate order. \n \u2022 A $10.6 million decrease in transmission expense in 2019 related to the flow through of tax repairs, as discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes. \n \u2022 A $10.3 million decrease in transmission expense in 2019 related to Tilden. Tilden, who was our customer, became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019. \nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $36.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan and additional expense recognized related to the adoption of Topic 842, as discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above. \n \u2022 A $14.4 million net increase in benefit costs, primarily related to higher deferred compensation costs in 2019. \nConsolidated Other Income, Net\n\n\n2019 Compared with 2018\nOther income, net increased $2.5 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 16, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\nConsolidated Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased $357.3 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Effective January 1, 2019, minimum lease payments were no longer classified within cost of sales or other operation and maintenance, but were instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 842. As a result of the adoption, for the year ended December 31, 2019, $350.9 million of minimum lease payments were recorded as interest expense on finance lease liabilities. See Note 12, Leases, for more information.\nConsolidated Income Tax Benefit\n\n2019 Compared with 2018\nOur effective tax rate decreased by 0.1% during for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increased benefit from the flow through of tax repairs in connection with the 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement, and the impact of the 2018 PSCW order regarding the benefits associated with the Tax Legislation. The impacts of the 2018 PSCW order related to the Tax Legislation and the flow through of tax repairs were offset in operating income at the utility segment. See Note 13, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect our 2020 annual effective tax rate to be between 12% and 13%, which includes an estimated 10% effective tax rate benefit due to the amortization of unprotected excess deferred taxes in connection with our 2019 Wisconsin rate order. Excluding this estimated effective tax rate benefit, the expected 2020 range would be between 22% and 23%.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources includes comparisons of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018. For a similar discussion that compares our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31:\n\n\nOperating Activities\n2019 Compared with 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $107.8 million during 2019, compared with 2018. Cash paid for interest increased $360.2 million during 2019, compared with 2018, as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), on January 1, 2019. This increase was offset by a corresponding decrease in cash paid for other operation and maintenance. As a result, this reclassification did not have a significant impact on our cash flows from operating activities and is not reflected in the following discussion. As shown below, the only cash flow item significantly impacted by Topic 842 related to the classification of our principal payments for finance leases. See Note 12, Leases, for more information. The $107.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by:\n \u2022 A $109.1 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers, primarily due to lower sales volumes driven by cooler summer weather during 2019, compared with 2018. Also contributing to this decrease was the transfer of a customer to UMERC. Tilden, the owner of an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, became a customer of UMERC on April 1, 2019. \n \u2022 A $38.2 million decrease", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating resources of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We also strive to provide the best value to our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by embracing constructive change, leveraging capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 2, Disposition, for information on the sale of Bostco's remaining real estate holdings.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018.

As shown in the table above, the changes related to these items had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder, but did significantly impact our operating income. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the flow through of tax repairs and Note 12, Leases, for more information on the adoption of Topic 842. See below for additional information on the $3.8 million increase in consolidated earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the operating income contribution of our utility segment and includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $760.2 million and $402.5 million, respectively. The operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to utility segment operating income.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td>

During 2018, the amount also included the lease payments that were billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates. We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019, which revised the previous guidance regarding the accounting for leases. As a result of this adoption, during 2019, $363.3 million of lease expense related to the We Power leases was no longer classified within other operation and maintenance, but was instead recorded as $15.8 million and $347.5 million of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, respectively, in accordance with Topic 842. \nDuring 2019, $134.8 million of operating and maintenance costs were billed to or incurred by us related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.

Tilden, who was our customer, became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019. \nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $4.8 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was higher sales volumes, due in part to colder winter weather, customer growth, and higher use per retail customer during 2019, compared with 2018. As measured by heating degree days, 2019 was 2.2% colder than 2018.\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment increased $357.7 million during 2019, compared with 2018. This increase was driven by $414.6 million of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes), partially offset by the $56.9 million net decrease in margins discussed above.\nThe utility segment experienced lower overall operating expenses related to efficiencies and effective cost control. The other significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses during 2019, compared with 2018, were:\n \u2022 A $363.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense resulting from the adoption of the new lease guidance. As discussed under the other operation and maintenance table above, the adoption of Topic 842, effective January 1, 2019, required us to change the income statement classification of our lease payments related to the We Power leases. During 2019, the lease expense related to the We Power leases was no longer classified within other operation and maintenance, but was instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 842. \n \u2022 A $70.0 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by lower maintenance and labor costs associated with our 2019 and 2018 plant retirements, and increases to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in our December 2019 Wisconsin rate order. Plant retirements included the 2019 retirement of the PIPP and the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the plant retirements. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our Wisconsin rate order. \n \u2022 A $10.6 million decrease in transmission expense in 2019 related to the flow through of tax repairs, as discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes. \n \u2022 A $10.3 million decrease in transmission expense in 2019 related to Tilden. Tilden, who was our customer, became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019. \nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $36.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan and additional expense recognized related to the adoption of Topic 842, as discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above. \n \u2022 A $14.4 million net increase in benefit costs, primarily related to higher deferred compensation costs in 2019. \nConsolidated Other Income, Net\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B (W)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFUDC - Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-service components of net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 Compared with 2018\nOther income, net increased $2.5 million during 2019, compared with 2018.

The increase was primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Effective January 1, 2019, minimum lease payments were no longer classified within cost of sales or other operation and maintenance, but were instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 842. As a result of the adoption, for the year ended December 31, 2019, $350.9 million of minimum lease payments were recorded as interest expense on finance lease liabilities. See Note 12, Leases, for more information.\nConsolidated Income Tax Benefit\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B (W)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 Compared with 2018\nOur effective tax rate decreased by 0.1% during for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increased benefit from the flow through of tax repairs in connection with the 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement, and the impact of the 2018 PSCW order regarding the benefits associated with the Tax Legislation. The impacts of the 2018 PSCW order related to the Tax Legislation and the flow through of tax repairs were offset in operating income at the utility segment. See Note 13, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect our 2020 annual effective tax rate to be between 12% and 13%, which includes an estimated 10% effective tax rate benefit due to the amortization of unprotected excess deferred taxes in connection with our 2019 Wisconsin rate order. Excluding this estimated effective tax rate benefit, the expected 2020 range would be between 22% and 23%.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources includes comparisons of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2019 Over 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>962.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(107.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(576.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(640.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(278.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(313.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n2019 Compared with 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $107.8 million during 2019, compared with 2018. Cash paid for interest increased $360.2 million during 2019, compared with 2018, as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), on January 1, 2019. This increase was offset by a corresponding decrease in cash paid for other operation and maintenance. As a result, this reclassification did not have a significant impact on our cash flows from operating activities and is not reflected in the following discussion. As shown below, the only cash flow item significantly impacted by Topic 842 related to the classification of our principal payments for finance leases. See Note 12, Leases, for more information. The $107.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by:\n \u2022 A $109.1 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers, primarily due to lower sales volumes driven by cooler summer weather during 2019, compared with 2018. Also contributing to this decrease was the transfer of a customer to UMERC. Tilden, the owner of an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, became a customer of UMERC on April 1, 2019. \n \u2022 A $38.2 million decrease"}
