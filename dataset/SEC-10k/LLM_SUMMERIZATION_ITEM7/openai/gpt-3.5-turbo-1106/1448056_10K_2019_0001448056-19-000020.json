Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments.\nOverview\nNew Relic is a strategic platform that companies use to monitor, manage, and operate their digital businesses. Our mission is to instrument, measure, and improve the Internet to help our customers create more perfect software,\nexperiences, and businesses. Our platform and suite of products enables users to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in real time.\nWe offer our customers a fully integrated software solution that provides visibility into every layer of the modern software stack, from infrastructure to the end-user experience, with an application-centric perspective. We believe that the application tier is the most strategic layer for delivering business value in modern software stacks, since the application is closest to the end-user. In addition, our cloud-based platform provides out-of-the-box curated experiences for our customers, enabling them to scale to meet the ever-changing needs of their business.\nOur most notable products include New Relic APM, New Relic Mobile, New Relic Browser, New Relic Synthetics, New Relic Infrastructure, and New Relic Insights.\nWe employ a land, expand, and standardize go-to-market strategy, which combines grassroots user adoption with both customized low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. We often land in new accounts to support grassroots projects, and because our products are easy to download and use, users within larger organizations often grow our footprint within their companies, as they increase the number of applications monitored and expand their use of our products. This allows customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic Platform to deliver real-time visibility into the operations of their digital business.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent periods, with revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 of $479.2 million and $355.1 million, respectively, representing 35% growth from 2018 to 2019. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will continue to decline over the long term as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. We have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing, infrastructure and operations, and have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses attributable to New Relic of $40.9 million and $45.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2019 was $305.6 million.\nInternationally, we currently offer our products in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA; Asia-Pacific, or APAC; and other non-U.S. locations, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, and our revenue from those regions constituted 18%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and 18%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenue overall and as a proportion of our revenue, and we are increasingly investing in our international operations and intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in international markets.\nOur employee headcount has increased to 1,774 employees as of March 31, 2019 from 1,284 as of March 31, 2018 and we plan to continue to invest aggressively in the growth of our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. For example, we intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, including further expanding our sales teams, increasing our marketing activities, and growing our international operations, particularly as we increase our sales to larger organizations. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in research and development to enhance and further develop our products and platform capabilities.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nMarket Adoption of Our Products. We continue to define a new category of enterprise software that is designed to make every aspect of modern software and infrastructure observable. Our success is dependent on the market adoption of this emerging category of software, which may not yet be well understood by the market. For the foreseeable future, we expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our products and we will incur significant expenses associated with educating the market about the benefits of our products.\nRetention of and Expansion within Paid Business Accounts. A key factor in our success is the retention and expansion of our subscription agreements with our existing customers. In order for us to continue to grow our business, it is important to generate additional revenue from our existing customers, and we intend to do this in several ways. As we improve our existing products and platform capabilities and introduce new products, we believe that the demand for our products will generally grow. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity for us to increase the number of subscriptions we sell to our current customers as they become more familiar with our products and adopt our products to address additional business use cases. Over the last several years, our focus has shifted from an increase in the total number of paid business accounts to an increase in the annual recurring revenue from our existing and largest paid business accounts. Accordingly, today we view our paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as a strong indicator of our business, and our success depends in part on our ability to retain and expand within our paid business accounts.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing to drive additional revenue. Any investments that we make in sales and marketing will occur in advance of our experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources. As we continue to focus sales and marketing investments primarily towards large organizations, this may require more of our resources. In addition, we expect our sales cycle to be longer and less predictable with respect to larger customers, which may delay realization of future sales. We also intend to increase our sales and marketing investment in international markets, such as Europe, and those markets may take longer and be more costly to develop than the U.S. market.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make key strategic decisions:\nNumber of Paid Business Accounts with Annual Recurring Revenue over $100,000 and Number of Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our number of paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 is an indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define the number of paid business accounts at the end of any particular period as the number of accounts at the end of the period, as identified by a unique account identifier, for which we have recognized revenue on the last day of the period indicated. A single organization or customer may have multiple paid business accounts for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries. We define annual recurring revenue as the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following 12 months, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We had 858 paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as of March 31, 2019, which was a 22% increase compared to 703 as of March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued sales and marketing focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. This growth rate has decreased in recent periods and we expect the growth rate at which we add paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 to continue to decrease over time as a result of deeper penetration into the enterprise market. Table 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paid Business Accounts > $100,000\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, as our primary focus has shifted to larger mid-market and enterprise customers, the total number of paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019 decreased in comparison to March 31, 2018. We round the number of total paid business accounts that we report as of a particular date down to the nearest hundred. We had over 16,900 paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019, compared to over 17,000 as of March 31, 2018.\nPercentage of Annualized Recurring Revenue from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts relative to our overall business is an important indicator of our success with respect to our focus in recent periods to improve our market penetration with enterprise companies. We define an enterprise paid business account as a paid business account that we measure to have over 1,000 employees. Growth or reduction reflected in this figure would include, in addition to the acquisition, loss or\nconsolidation of enterprise paid business accounts, any changes we make to the categorization of existing paid business accounts, for example to reflect that they have expanded beyond the employee threshold, which we review periodically.\nOur percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts was 61% as of March 31, 2019, compared to 54% as of March 31, 2018. During the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, we conducted our periodic review of the categorization of our existing paid business accounts, and the impact of these reclassifications is reflected in the period-over-period increase. We expect the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts to continue to increase over time. Table 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Mar 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sep 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Jun 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Annualized Recurring Revenue from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnualized Revenue per Average Paid Business Account. We believe that our annualized revenue per average paid business account is another indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define our annualized revenue per average paid business account as the annualized revenue for the current period divided by the average of the number of paid business accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the prior period. We round down our annualized revenue per average paid business account to the nearest $500.\nOur annualized revenue per average paid business account for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 grew to over $31,000, which was an increase of 34.8% compared to over $23,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. We have experienced an increase in the rate of growth of our annualized revenue per average paid business account year-over-year but we expect this rate to decrease over time as our business scales and we introduce alternative pricing options for our products.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our existing customers. We track our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate increases when customers increase their use of our products, use additional products, or upgrade to a higher subscription tier. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is reduced when customers cease using our products, use fewer products, or downgrade to a lower subscription tier.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate compares our recurring subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. We measure our dollar-based net expansion rate on a monthly basis because many of our customers change their subscriptions more frequently than quarterly or annually. To calculate our annual dollar-based net expansion rate, we first establish the base period monthly recurring revenue from all our customers at the end of a month. This represents the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following month, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We then (i) calculate the actual monthly recurring revenue from those same customers at the end of that following month; then (ii) divide that following month's recurring revenue by the base month's recurring revenue to arrive at our monthly net expansion rate; then (iii) calculate a quarterly net expansion rate by compounding the net expansion rates of the three months in the quarter; and then (iv) calculate our annualized net expansion rate by compounding our quarterly net expansion rate over an annual period.\nThe quarterly fluctuations in our dollar-based net expansion rate are primarily driven by transactions within a particular quarter in which certain larger subscription customers either significantly upgrade or significantly downgrade their subscriptions and by increased sales to existing customers in particular quarters due to sales and marketing campaigns in a particular quarter. In addition, we believe that the composition of our customer base also has an impact on the net expansion rate, such that a relative increase in the number of customers from larger enterprises versus small to medium-sized organizations will tend to increase our quarterly net expansion rate, while a relative increase in the number of customers from small to medium-sized organizations versus larger enterprises will tend to decrease the quarterly net expansion rate, as smaller businesses tend to cancel subscriptions more frequently than larger enterprises. This rate is also impacted by factors including, but not limited to, new product introductions, promotional activity, mix of customer size, and the variable timing of renewals.\nOur annualized dollar-based net expansion rate declined to 130.9% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 from 141.2% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Although we drove larger upsell activity in absolute dollars during the fiscal quarter, we saw a lower amount of upsell activity relative to our total installed base than the comparable period in the prior year, which had a moderating effect on our annualized dollar-based net expansion rate.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate\n</td> <td>130.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer access to our products under subscription plans that include service and support for one or more of our products. For our paying customers, we offer a variety of pricing plans based on the particular product purchased by an account, number of servers monitored, number of applications monitored, or number of mobile devices monitored. Our plans typically have terms of one year, although some of our customers commit for shorter or longer periods. Historically, most of our customers have paid us on a monthly basis. As a result, our deferred revenue at any given period of time had been relatively low. In recent periods we have secured an increased percentage of longer-duration commitments, largely because we have sold more to larger organizations. Because we generally invoice many of these larger organizations less frequently, our deferred revenue has increased over time, and we expect it to continue to increase on a year-over-year basis.\nHowever, due to our mix of subscription plans and billing frequencies, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\nAdditionally, we expect our business to become more seasonal as mid-market and enterprise customers start to represent a larger percentage of our revenues. The first two quarters of each fiscal year usually have lower or potentially negative sequential deferred revenue growth than the third and fourth fiscal quarters, during which we generally benefit from a larger renewal pool and opportunity to upsell existing customers. As a result, over time we could potentially see stronger sequential revenue results in our fourth and first fiscal quarters as our deferred revenue is recognized. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our sales and operating results in the future, which can make it difficult to achieve sequential growth in certain financial metrics or could result in sequential declines on a quarterly basis.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses relating to data center operations, hosting-related costs, payment processing fees, depreciation and amortization, consulting costs, and salaries and benefits of operations and global customer support personnel. Salaries and benefits costs associated with our operations and global customer support personnel consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We plan to continue increasing the capacity, capability, and reliability of our infrastructure to support the growth of our customer adoption and the number of products we offer, as customer usage continues to grow.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our operations and global customer support personnel, hosting-related costs, and the amortization of capitalized software. We expect that our gross margin will decline modestly over the long term, although we expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period as a result of these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nPersonnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. We also incur other non-personnel costs such as an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and an allocation of our general overhead expenses. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products, and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing products. We capitalize the portion of our software development costs that meets the criteria for capitalization.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product management, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs for our sales, marketing, and business development employees and executives. Commissions are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. Under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606 these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of our marketing and brand awareness programs.\nWe plan to continue investing in sales and marketing globally by increasing the number of our sales personnel, expanding our domestic and international marketing activities, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, information technology, finance and accounting employees, and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as legal and other professional fees.\nWe plan to continue to expand our business both domestically and internationally, and we expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses, such as litigation costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nResults of Operations For Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. For a discussion of our consolidated statement of operations data for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and as a percentage of revenue for that period, see Results of Operations for Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 11, 2018. The period to period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. Results as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the period presented, ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

each period presented, primarily due to sales of new subscriptions to our products and expanding use of our products by our existing customers. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential growth in revenue will continue. In future periods, as our rate of revenue growth declines, seasonality in our revenue may become more apparent.\nQuarterly Gross Margin Trends\nOur gross margin has remained relatively consistent over all periods presented, with the fluctuations primarily due to the timing and extent of our investments in our operations and global customer support personnel, and hosting-related costs.\nQuarterly Expense Trends\nResearch and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses generally increased sequentially over the periods as we increased our headcount to support continued investment in our products. The increase in personnel costs was primarily related to increases in headcount, along with higher stock-based compensation expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) From Operations\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic. We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic as the respective GAAP balance, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in software development costs, (3) the amortization of purchased intangibles, (4) employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans, as applicable , and (5) amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, and in certain periods (6) the transaction costs related to acquisitions and (7) lawsuit litigation expense. We use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe these measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our operational performance. We have provided below a reconciliation of GAAP loss from operations to non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic, internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. In addition, our bonus opportunity for eligible employees and executives is based in part on non-GAAP income (loss) from operations.\nWe believe non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic are useful to investors and others in assessing our operating performance due to the following factors:\nStock-based compensation expense and amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in software development costs. We utilize share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\nThe amortization of purchased intangibles and the transaction costs related to acquisition. We view amortization of purchased intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Similarly, we view acquisition related expenses as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period.\nLawsuit litigation expense. We may from time to time incur charges or benefits related to litigation that are outside of the ordinary course of our business. We believe it is useful to exclude such charges or benefits because we do not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operation of our business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the matter.\nEmployer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans. We exclude employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of our business.\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs. In May 2018, New Relic issued $500.25 million of Notes, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.5%. The effective interest rate of the Notes was 5.74%. This is a result of the debt discount recorded for the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity, and debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The expense for the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in our industry and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results.\nThe following tables present our non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and our non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic and reconcile our GAAP loss from operations to non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and our GAAP net loss attributable to New Relic to our non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to New Relic for the three months and fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, seasonality of our billing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support our growth strategy, and the continued market acceptance of our products. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. We may need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities in order to meet those capital requirements. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $115.5 million as a result of a net loss of $40.9 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $125.7 million and a change of $31.5 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $81.6 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increased sales of subscriptions and a $11.5 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits and other liabilities due to increased headcount. This was partially offset by a $38.7 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs due to increased sales, a $22.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, a $1.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $0.2 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $1.2 million decrease in deferred rent.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $35.7 million as a result of a net loss of $45.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $65.4 million and a change of $15.6 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $63.9 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increased sales of subscriptions and a $2.1 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits and other liabilities due to increased headcount. This was partially offset by a $38.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales of subscriptions, a $9.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $1.8 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $0.5 million decrease in deferred rent.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $18.9 million as a result of a net loss of $61.1 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $51.9 million and a change of $28.1 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $51.7 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increased sales of subscriptions, a $5.6 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits and other liabilities due to increased headcount, a $4.1 million increase in deferred rent due to new offices space, and a $0.7 million increase in accounts payable. This was partially offset by a $30.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales of subscriptions, a $3.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was $470.7 million, primarily as a result of purchases of short-term investments of $659.4 million, cash paid for acquisitions of $30.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $43.3 million, and increases in capitalization of software development costs of $5.2 million. These were offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments of $267.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $23.8 million, primarily as a result of purchases of short-term investments of $128.7 million, purchases of property and equipment of $21.4 million, and increases in\ncapitalization of software development costs of $4.8 million. These were offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments of $131.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $18.5 million, primarily as a result of purchases of short-term investments of $168.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $21.4 million, and increases in capitalization of software development costs of $4.1 million. These were offset by proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments of $175.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was $457.6 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $488.7 million, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $11.2 million, proceeds from our issuance of common stock of $17.4 million, and our investment in the redeemable non-controlling interest of $3.6 million. These were offset by the purchase of capped call related to the convertible senior note issuance of $63.2 million.\nCash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $32.4 million, which was the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan.\nCash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $22.0 million, which was the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of March 31, 2019, our future non-cancelable contractual obligations were as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal amount payable on convertible senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>110,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>33,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Consists of future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases for office space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to hosting services and software subscriptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above, as it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results\ncould differ from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from subscription-based arrangements that allow our customers to access our products. Our sales agreements have contract terms typically for one year.\nWe determine revenue through the following steps: (i) identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue, when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe recognize subscription revenue on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription period of the arrangement beginning when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, and the employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, in our financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. We estimate the fair value of each option award on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and a single option award approach. The fair value of RSUs and RSAs is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions we use in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair Value of Common Stock. Since our IPO, we have used the market closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each option group.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected Term.

We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of our publicly traded peer group as we do not have significant trading history for our common stock. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the technology industry that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We used the same set of peer group companies in all the relevant valuation estimates. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nin which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nWe estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive six-month offering periods. Prior to February 2017, we used our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. Beginning in February 2017, we started to use our own historical volatility data. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combination\nWe recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the third quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of goodwill or a significant decrease in expected cash flows.\nIntangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology, resulting from our acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe 2023 Notes are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments, such as the 2023 Notes, that have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. The carrying amount of the liability component of the instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option. The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument. The difference between the principal amount and the liability component represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the respective term of the 2023 Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the\nissuance costs related to the 2023 Notes, the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with our internal use software and website. These capitalized costs are primarily related to our software tools that are hosted by us and accessed by our customers on a subscription basis. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional features and functionality. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have considered our future anticipated market growth, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate along with prudent, feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the extent to which our deferred tax assets may be realizable. Projections inherently include a level of uncertainty that could result in lower or higher than expected future taxable income. When we determine that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized in the future, the related valuation allowance will be reduced and a benefit to operations will be recorded. Conversely, if we were to make a determination that we will not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future (using the more likely than not\u201d criteria), we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance and a charge to operations in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. If interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were incurred, such amounts would be included in our provision for income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.", "summary": "The report discusses New Relic's financial condition and operations, emphasizing its mission to improve the Internet and its strategic platform for monitoring digital businesses.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments.\nOverview\nNew Relic is a strategic platform that companies use to monitor, manage, and operate their digital businesses. Our mission is to instrument, measure, and improve the Internet to help our customers create more perfect software,\nexperiences, and businesses. Our platform and suite of products enables users to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in real time.\nWe offer our customers a fully integrated software solution that provides visibility into every layer of the modern software stack, from infrastructure to the end-user experience, with an application-centric perspective. We believe that the application tier is the most strategic layer for delivering business value in modern software stacks, since the application is closest to the end-user. In addition, our cloud-based platform provides out-of-the-box curated experiences for our customers, enabling them to scale to meet the ever-changing needs of their business.\nOur most notable products include New Relic APM, New Relic Mobile, New Relic Browser, New Relic Synthetics, New Relic Infrastructure, and New Relic Insights.\nWe employ a land, expand, and standardize go-to-market strategy, which combines grassroots user adoption with both customized low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. We often land in new accounts to support grassroots projects, and because our products are easy to download and use, users within larger organizations often grow our footprint within their companies, as they increase the number of applications monitored and expand their use of our products. This allows customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic Platform to deliver real-time visibility into the operations of their digital business.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent periods, with revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 of $479.2 million and $355.1 million, respectively, representing 35% growth from 2018 to 2019. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will continue to decline over the long term as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. We have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing, infrastructure and operations, and have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses attributable to New Relic of $40.9 million and $45.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2019 was $305.6 million.\nInternationally, we currently offer our products in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA; Asia-Pacific, or APAC; and other non-U.S. locations, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, and our revenue from those regions constituted 18%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and 18%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenue overall and as a proportion of our revenue, and we are increasingly investing in our international operations and intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in international markets.\nOur employee headcount has increased to 1,774 employees as of March 31, 2019 from 1,284 as of March 31, 2018 and we plan to continue to invest aggressively in the growth of our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. For example, we intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, including further expanding our sales teams, increasing our marketing activities, and growing our international operations, particularly as we increase our sales to larger organizations. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in research and development to enhance and further develop our products and platform capabilities.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nMarket Adoption of Our Products. We continue to define a new category of enterprise software that is designed to make every aspect of modern software and infrastructure observable. Our success is dependent on the market adoption of this emerging category of software, which may not yet be well understood by the market. For the foreseeable future, we expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our products and we will incur significant expenses associated with educating the market about the benefits of our products.\nRetention of and Expansion within Paid Business Accounts. A key factor in our success is the retention and expansion of our subscription agreements with our existing customers. In order for us to continue to grow our business, it is important to generate additional revenue from our existing customers, and we intend to do this in several ways. As we improve our existing products and platform capabilities and introduce new products, we believe that the demand for our products will generally grow. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity for us to increase the number of subscriptions we sell to our current customers as they become more familiar with our products and adopt our products to address additional business use cases. Over the last several years, our focus has shifted from an increase in the total number of paid business accounts to an increase in the annual recurring revenue from our existing and largest paid business accounts. Accordingly, today we view our paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as a strong indicator of our business, and our success depends in part on our ability to retain and expand within our paid business accounts.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing to drive additional revenue. Any investments that we make in sales and marketing will occur in advance of our experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources. As we continue to focus sales and marketing investments primarily towards large organizations, this may require more of our resources. In addition, we expect our sales cycle to be longer and less predictable with respect to larger customers, which may delay realization of future sales. We also intend to increase our sales and marketing investment in international markets, such as Europe, and those markets may take longer and be more costly to develop than the U.S. market.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make key strategic decisions:\nNumber of Paid Business Accounts with Annual Recurring Revenue over $100,000 and Number of Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our number of paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 is an indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define the number of paid business accounts at the end of any particular period as the number of accounts at the end of the period, as identified by a unique account identifier, for which we have recognized revenue on the last day of the period indicated. A single organization or customer may have multiple paid business accounts for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries. We define annual recurring revenue as the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following 12 months, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We had 858 paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as of March 31, 2019, which was a 22% increase compared to 703 as of March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued sales and marketing focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. This growth rate has decreased in recent periods and we expect the growth rate at which we add paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 to continue to decrease over time as a result of deeper penetration into the enterprise market. \nFurther, as our primary focus has shifted to larger mid-market and enterprise customers, the total number of paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019 decreased in comparison to March 31, 2018. We round the number of total paid business accounts that we report as of a particular date down to the nearest hundred. We had over 16,900 paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019, compared to over 17,000 as of March 31, 2018.\nPercentage of Annualized Recurring Revenue from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts relative to our overall business is an important indicator of our success with respect to our focus in recent periods to improve our market penetration with enterprise companies. We define an enterprise paid business account as a paid business account that we measure to have over 1,000 employees. Growth or reduction reflected in this figure would include, in addition to the acquisition, loss or\nconsolidation of enterprise paid business accounts, any changes we make to the categorization of existing paid business accounts, for example to reflect that they have expanded beyond the employee threshold, which we review periodically.\nOur percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts was 61% as of March 31, 2019, compared to 54% as of March 31, 2018. During the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, we conducted our periodic review of the categorization of our existing paid business accounts, and the impact of these reclassifications is reflected in the period-over-period increase. We expect the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts to continue to increase over time. \nAnnualized Revenue per Average Paid Business Account. We believe that our annualized revenue per average paid business account is another indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define our annualized revenue per average paid business account as the annualized revenue for the current period divided by the average of the number of paid business accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the prior period. We round down our annualized revenue per average paid business account to the nearest $500.\nOur annualized revenue per average paid business account for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 grew to over $31,000, which was an increase of 34.8% compared to over $23,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. We have experienced an increase in the rate of growth of our annualized revenue per average paid business account year-over-year but we expect this rate to decrease over time as our business scales and we introduce alternative pricing options for our products.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our existing customers. We track our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate increases when customers increase their use of our products, use additional products, or upgrade to a higher subscription tier. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is reduced when customers cease using our products, use fewer products, or downgrade to a lower subscription tier.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate compares our recurring subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. We measure our dollar-based net expansion rate on a monthly basis because many of our customers change their subscriptions more frequently than quarterly or annually. To calculate our annual dollar-based net expansion rate, we first establish the base period monthly recurring revenue from all our customers at the end of a month. This represents the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following month, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We then (i) calculate the actual monthly recurring revenue from those same customers at the end of that following month; then (ii) divide that following month's recurring revenue by the base month's recurring revenue to arrive at our monthly net expansion rate; then (iii) calculate a quarterly net expansion rate by compounding the net expansion rates of the three months in the quarter; and then (iv) calculate our annualized net expansion rate by compounding our quarterly net expansion rate over an annual period.\nThe quarterly fluctuations in our dollar-based net expansion rate are primarily driven by transactions within a particular quarter in which certain larger subscription customers either significantly upgrade or significantly downgrade their subscriptions and by increased sales to existing customers in particular quarters due to sales and marketing campaigns in a particular quarter. In addition, we believe that the composition of our customer base also has an impact on the net expansion rate, such that a relative increase in the number of customers from larger enterprises versus small to medium-sized organizations will tend to increase our quarterly net expansion rate, while a relative increase in the number of customers from small to medium-sized organizations versus larger enterprises will tend to decrease the quarterly net expansion rate, as smaller businesses tend to cancel subscriptions more frequently than larger enterprises. This rate is also impacted by factors including, but not limited to, new product introductions, promotional activity, mix of customer size, and the variable timing of renewals.\nOur annualized dollar-based net expansion rate declined to 130.9% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 from 141.2% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Although we drove larger upsell activity in absolute dollars during the fiscal quarter, we saw a lower amount of upsell activity relative to our total installed base than the comparable period in the prior year, which had a moderating effect on our annualized dollar-based net expansion rate.\n\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer access to our products under subscription plans that include service and support for one or more of our products. For our paying customers, we offer a variety of pricing plans based on the particular product purchased by an account, number of servers monitored, number of applications monitored, or number of mobile devices monitored. Our plans typically have terms of one year, although some of our customers commit for shorter or longer periods. Historically, most of our customers have paid us on a monthly basis. As a result, our deferred revenue at any given period of time had been relatively low. In recent periods we have secured an increased percentage of longer-duration commitments, largely because we have sold more to larger organizations. Because we generally invoice many of these larger organizations less frequently, our deferred revenue has increased over time, and we expect it to continue to increase on a year-over-year basis.\nHowever, due to our mix of subscription plans and billing frequencies, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\nAdditionally, we expect our business to become more seasonal as mid-market and enterprise customers start to represent a larger percentage of our revenues. The first two quarters of each fiscal year usually have lower or potentially negative sequential deferred revenue growth than the third and fourth fiscal quarters, during which we generally benefit from a larger renewal pool and opportunity to upsell existing customers. As a result, over time we could potentially see stronger sequential revenue results in our fourth and first fiscal quarters as our deferred revenue is recognized. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our sales and operating results in the future, which can make it difficult to achieve sequential growth in certain financial metrics or could result in sequential declines on a quarterly basis.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses relating to data center operations, hosting-related costs, payment processing fees, depreciation and amortization, consulting costs, and salaries and benefits of operations and global customer support personnel. Salaries and benefits costs associated with our operations and global customer support personnel consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We plan to continue increasing the capacity, capability, and reliability of our infrastructure to support the growth of our customer adoption and the number of products we offer, as customer usage continues to grow.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our operations and global customer support personnel, hosting-related costs, and the amortization of capitalized software. We expect that our gross margin will decline modestly over the long term, although we expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period as a result of these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nPersonnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. We also incur other non-personnel costs such as an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and an allocation of our general overhead expenses. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products, and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing products. We capitalize the portion of our software development costs that meets the criteria for capitalization.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product management, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs for our sales, marketing, and business development employees and executives. Commissions are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. Under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606 these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of our marketing and brand awareness programs.\nWe plan to continue investing in sales and marketing globally by increasing the number of our sales personnel, expanding our domestic and international marketing activities, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, information technology, finance and accounting employees, and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as legal and other professional fees.\nWe plan to continue to expand our business both domestically and internationally, and we expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses, such as litigation costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nResults of Operations For Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. For a discussion of our consolidated statement of operations data for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and as a percentage of revenue for that period, see Results of Operations for Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 11, 2018. The period to period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. Results as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the period presented, ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased $124.2 million, or 35%, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in product adoption by existing paid business accounts. Our revenue from EMEA increased $22.1 million, or 34%, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and our revenue from APAC increased $11.9 million, or 45%, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as a result of an increase in the number of paid business accounts and an increase in product adoption by existing paid business accounts located in these geographic regions.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased $14.7 million, or 23%, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in personnel-related costs, allocated costs, facilities, and hosting-related costs necessary to support our growth, as well as an increase in payment processing costs due to the increase in revenue. Personnel-related costs increased by $6.7 million, driven by higher headcount, and hosting-related costs and payment processing fees increased by $4.9 million, primarily due to increased operating costs to support revenue growth. Depreciation expense and amortization expense increased by $1.9 million, facilities expenses increased by $0.9 million, and miscellaneous expenses increased by $0.3 million.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $30.5 million, or 41%, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments.\nOverview\nNew Relic is a strategic platform that companies use to monitor, manage, and operate their digital businesses. Our mission is to instrument, measure, and improve the Internet to help our customers create more perfect software,\nexperiences, and businesses. Our platform and suite of products enables users to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in real time.\nWe offer our customers a fully integrated software solution that provides visibility into every layer of the modern software stack, from infrastructure to the end-user experience, with an application-centric perspective. We believe that the application tier is the most strategic layer for delivering business value in modern software stacks, since the application is closest to the end-user. In addition, our cloud-based platform provides out-of-the-box curated experiences for our customers, enabling them to scale to meet the ever-changing needs of their business.\nOur most notable products include New Relic APM, New Relic Mobile, New Relic Browser, New Relic Synthetics, New Relic Infrastructure, and New Relic Insights.\nWe employ a land, expand, and standardize go-to-market strategy, which combines grassroots user adoption with both customized low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. We often land in new accounts to support grassroots projects, and because our products are easy to download and use, users within larger organizations often grow our footprint within their companies, as they increase the number of applications monitored and expand their use of our products. This allows customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic Platform to deliver real-time visibility into the operations of their digital business.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent periods, with revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 of $479.2 million and $355.1 million, respectively, representing 35% growth from 2018 to 2019. We expect that the rate of growth in our revenue will continue to decline over the long term as our business scales, even if our revenue continues to grow in absolute terms. We have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing, infrastructure and operations, and have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses attributable to New Relic of $40.9 million and $45.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2019 was $305.6 million.\nInternationally, we currently offer our products in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA; Asia-Pacific, or APAC; and other non-U.S. locations, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, and our revenue from those regions constituted 18%, 8%, and 5%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and 18%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenue overall and as a proportion of our revenue, and we are increasingly investing in our international operations and intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in international markets.\nOur employee headcount has increased to 1,774 employees as of March 31, 2019 from 1,284 as of March 31, 2018 and we plan to continue to invest aggressively in the growth of our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. For example, we intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, including further expanding our sales teams, increasing our marketing activities, and growing our international operations, particularly as we increase our sales to larger organizations. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in research and development to enhance and further develop our products and platform capabilities.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nMarket Adoption of Our Products. We continue to define a new category of enterprise software that is designed to make every aspect of modern software and infrastructure observable. Our success is dependent on the market adoption of this emerging category of software, which may not yet be well understood by the market. For the foreseeable future, we expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our products and we will incur significant expenses associated with educating the market about the benefits of our products.\nRetention of and Expansion within Paid Business Accounts. A key factor in our success is the retention and expansion of our subscription agreements with our existing customers. In order for us to continue to grow our business, it is important to generate additional revenue from our existing customers, and we intend to do this in several ways. As we improve our existing products and platform capabilities and introduce new products, we believe that the demand for our products will generally grow. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity for us to increase the number of subscriptions we sell to our current customers as they become more familiar with our products and adopt our products to address additional business use cases. Over the last several years, our focus has shifted from an increase in the total number of paid business accounts to an increase in the annual recurring revenue from our existing and largest paid business accounts. Accordingly, today we view our paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as a strong indicator of our business, and our success depends in part on our ability to retain and expand within our paid business accounts.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing to drive additional revenue. Any investments that we make in sales and marketing will occur in advance of our experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources. As we continue to focus sales and marketing investments primarily towards large organizations, this may require more of our resources. In addition, we expect our sales cycle to be longer and less predictable with respect to larger customers, which may delay realization of future sales. We also intend to increase our sales and marketing investment in international markets, such as Europe, and those markets may take longer and be more costly to develop than the U.S. market.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make key strategic decisions:\nNumber of Paid Business Accounts with Annual Recurring Revenue over $100,000 and Number of Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our number of paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 is an indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define the number of paid business accounts at the end of any particular period as the number of accounts at the end of the period, as identified by a unique account identifier, for which we have recognized revenue on the last day of the period indicated. A single organization or customer may have multiple paid business accounts for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries. We define annual recurring revenue as the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following 12 months, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We had 858 paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 as of March 31, 2019, which was a 22% increase compared to 703 as of March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued sales and marketing focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. This growth rate has decreased in recent periods and we expect the growth rate at which we add paid business accounts with annual recurring revenue over $100,000 to continue to decrease over time as a result of deeper penetration into the enterprise market. Table 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paid Business Accounts > $100,000\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>748\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, as our primary focus has shifted to larger mid-market and enterprise customers, the total number of paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019 decreased in comparison to March 31, 2018. We round the number of total paid business accounts that we report as of a particular date down to the nearest hundred. We had over 16,900 paid business accounts as of March 31, 2019, compared to over 17,000 as of March 31, 2018.\nPercentage of Annualized Recurring Revenue from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts. We believe that our ability to increase the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts relative to our overall business is an important indicator of our success with respect to our focus in recent periods to improve our market penetration with enterprise companies. We define an enterprise paid business account as a paid business account that we measure to have over 1,000 employees. Growth or reduction reflected in this figure would include, in addition to the acquisition, loss or\nconsolidation of enterprise paid business accounts, any changes we make to the categorization of existing paid business accounts, for example to reflect that they have expanded beyond the employee threshold, which we review periodically.\nOur percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts was 61% as of March 31, 2019, compared to 54% as of March 31, 2018. During the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, we conducted our periodic review of the categorization of our existing paid business accounts, and the impact of these reclassifications is reflected in the period-over-period increase. We expect the percentage of annualized recurring revenue from enterprise paid business accounts to continue to increase over time. Table 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Mar 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sep 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Jun 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Annualized Recurring Revenue from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnualized Revenue per Average Paid Business Account. We believe that our annualized revenue per average paid business account is another indicator of our business as it relates to the acquisition of larger accounts within our overall customer base, including our market penetration of larger mid-market and enterprise customers, as well as deeper penetration into our existing customer base. We define our annualized revenue per average paid business account as the annualized revenue for the current period divided by the average of the number of paid business accounts at the end of the current period and the end of the prior period. We round down our annualized revenue per average paid business account to the nearest $500.\nOur annualized revenue per average paid business account for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 grew to over $31,000, which was an increase of 34.8% compared to over $23,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. We believe this increase reflects our continued focus on larger mid-market and enterprise customers. We have experienced an increase in the rate of growth of our annualized revenue per average paid business account year-over-year but we expect this rate to decrease over time as our business scales and we introduce alternative pricing options for our products.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Our ability to generate revenue is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our existing customers. We track our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate. Our dollar-based net expansion rate increases when customers increase their use of our products, use additional products, or upgrade to a higher subscription tier. Our dollar-based net expansion rate is reduced when customers cease using our products, use fewer products, or downgrade to a lower subscription tier.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate compares our recurring subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. We measure our dollar-based net expansion rate on a monthly basis because many of our customers change their subscriptions more frequently than quarterly or annually. To calculate our annual dollar-based net expansion rate, we first establish the base period monthly recurring revenue from all our customers at the end of a month. This represents the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following month, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. We then (i) calculate the actual monthly recurring revenue from those same customers at the end of that following month; then (ii) divide that following month's recurring revenue by the base month's recurring revenue to arrive at our monthly net expansion rate; then (iii) calculate a quarterly net expansion rate by compounding the net expansion rates of the three months in the quarter; and then (iv) calculate our annualized net expansion rate by compounding our quarterly net expansion rate over an annual period.\nThe quarterly fluctuations in our dollar-based net expansion rate are primarily driven by transactions within a particular quarter in which certain larger subscription customers either significantly upgrade or significantly downgrade their subscriptions and by increased sales to existing customers in particular quarters due to sales and marketing campaigns in a particular quarter. In addition, we believe that the composition of our customer base also has an impact on the net expansion rate, such that a relative increase in the number of customers from larger enterprises versus small to medium-sized organizations will tend to increase our quarterly net expansion rate, while a relative increase in the number of customers from small to medium-sized organizations versus larger enterprises will tend to decrease the quarterly net expansion rate, as smaller businesses tend to cancel subscriptions more frequently than larger enterprises. This rate is also impacted by factors including, but not limited to, new product introductions, promotional activity, mix of customer size, and the variable timing of renewals.\nOur annualized dollar-based net expansion rate declined to 130.9% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 from 141.2% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Although we drove larger upsell activity in absolute dollars during the fiscal quarter, we saw a lower amount of upsell activity relative to our total installed base than the comparable period in the prior year, which had a moderating effect on our annualized dollar-based net expansion rate.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate\n</td> <td>130.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer access to our products under subscription plans that include service and support for one or more of our products. For our paying customers, we offer a variety of pricing plans based on the particular product purchased by an account, number of servers monitored, number of applications monitored, or number of mobile devices monitored. Our plans typically have terms of one year, although some of our customers commit for shorter or longer periods. Historically, most of our customers have paid us on a monthly basis. As a result, our deferred revenue at any given period of time had been relatively low. In recent periods we have secured an increased percentage of longer-duration commitments, largely because we have sold more to larger organizations. Because we generally invoice many of these larger organizations less frequently, our deferred revenue has increased over time, and we expect it to continue to increase on a year-over-year basis.\nHowever, due to our mix of subscription plans and billing frequencies, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\nAdditionally, we expect our business to become more seasonal as mid-market and enterprise customers start to represent a larger percentage of our revenues. The first two quarters of each fiscal year usually have lower or potentially negative sequential deferred revenue growth than the third and fourth fiscal quarters, during which we generally benefit from a larger renewal pool and opportunity to upsell existing customers. As a result, over time we could potentially see stronger sequential revenue results in our fourth and first fiscal quarters as our deferred revenue is recognized. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our sales and operating results in the future, which can make it difficult to achieve sequential growth in certain financial metrics or could result in sequential declines on a quarterly basis.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of expenses relating to data center operations, hosting-related costs, payment processing fees, depreciation and amortization, consulting costs, and salaries and benefits of operations and global customer support personnel. Salaries and benefits costs associated with our operations and global customer support personnel consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We plan to continue increasing the capacity, capability, and reliability of our infrastructure to support the growth of our customer adoption and the number of products we offer, as customer usage continues to grow.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our operations and global customer support personnel, hosting-related costs, and the amortization of capitalized software. We expect that our gross margin will decline modestly over the long term, although we expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period as a result of these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nPersonnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. We also incur other non-personnel costs such as an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and an allocation of our general overhead expenses. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products, and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing products. We capitalize the portion of our software development costs that meets the criteria for capitalization.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product management, and design teams to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs for our sales, marketing, and business development employees and executives. Commissions are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. Under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, or ASC 606 these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of our marketing and brand awareness programs.\nWe plan to continue investing in sales and marketing globally by increasing the number of our sales personnel, expanding our domestic and international marketing activities, building brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, information technology, finance and accounting employees, and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as legal and other professional fees.\nWe plan to continue to expand our business both domestically and internationally, and we expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We also expect that we will continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses, such as litigation costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nResults of Operations For Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.

Personnel-related costs increased by $6.7 million, driven by higher headcount, and hosting-related costs and payment processing fees increased by $4.9 million, primarily due to increased operating costs to support revenue growth.
