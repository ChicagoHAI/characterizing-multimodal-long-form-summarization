We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that may affect the results of our operations include, among others: our ability to successfully execute our business strategies, including integration of acquisitions and the future acquisition of other businesses to grow our Company; customers' cancellation on short notice of master service agreements from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue or our failure to renew such master service agreements on favorable terms or at all; our ability to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor to meet the requirements of our labor-intensive business or labor difficulties which could have an effect on our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts; the ultimate geographic spread, duration and severity of the coronavirus outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken, or actions that may be taken, by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or ameliorate its effects; our failure to compete effectively in our highly competitive industry, which could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our market share and harm our financial performance; our ability to adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry's and customers' evolving demands; our history of losses, deficiency in working capital and a stockholders' deficit and our inability to achieve sustained profitability; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future; our substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations; the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business; and changes in general market, economic, social and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements. You should read this report in its entirety and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward-looking statements, even in the event that our situation changes in the future, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.\nEffects of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and their third-party suppliers and sellers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have adapted numerous aspects of our logistics and transportation processes. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.\nThe impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to it had some effects on our results of operations. Effects of the pandemic have included increased fulfillment costs, primarily due to investments in employee hiring, pay, and benefits, as well as costs to maintain safe workplaces, and higher shipping costs. We expect to continue to be affected by possible procurement and shipping delays, supply chain interruptions, higher product demand in certain categories, lower product demand in other categories, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and it is not possible to determine the duration and spread of the pandemic or such actions, the ultimate impact on our results of operations during 2022, or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations.\nOverview\nTransportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. ( TLSS\u201d or the Company\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company operates through its active subsidiaries as a logistics and transportation company specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services for predominantly online retailers.\nWe are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns its own transportation equipment. We employ our own drivers and use the services of independent contractors who may use their own vehicles.\nBetween June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through two New Jersey-based subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries were Prime EFS, LLC, which conducted a last-mile business focused on deliveries to retail consumers for our primary customer in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania ( Prime EFS\u201d), and Shypdirect, LLC ( Shypdirect\u201d), which formed in July 2018 and focused on, and conducted, our long-haul and mid-mile delivery businesses.\nThe great bulk of Prime EFS's business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the Prime EFS DSP Program\u201d) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. ( Amazon\u201d). In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Amazon made clear to Prime EFS that Amazon's decision not to renew the DSP agreement was part of a well-publicized initiative by Amazon to restructure how it would be delivering its last-mile services and did not reflect the quality of the services provided by Prime EFS. Prime EFS ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon's non-renewal of the Prime EFS DSP Program.\nShypdirect conducted its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc., last amended on August 24, 2020 (the Program Agreement\u201d). Under that agreement, Shypdirect provided transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services for Amazon and its customers. On July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (the Shypdirect Termination Notice\u201d). On August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, Prime EFS would release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and Prime EFS would covenant not to sue Amazon (the Aug. 3 Proposal\u201d). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal. The Program Agreement expired on May 14, 2021. In June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of our total net revenues. Approximately 28.5% of our revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nOn August 16, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect, executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in the State of New Jersey pursuant to N.J.S.A. \u00a72A:19-1, et seq. (the ABC Statute\u201d), assigning all Prime EFS and Shypdirect assets to Terri Jane Freedman as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors (the Assignee\u201d) and filing for dissolution. An Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors,\u201d general assignment\u201d or ABC\u201d in New Jersey is a state-law, voluntary, judicially-supervised corporate liquidation and unwinding similar to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process found in the United States Bankruptcy Code. In an ABC, debtor companies, here Prime EFS and Shypdirect, together referred to as the Assignors,\u201dexecute Deeds of Assignment, assigning all of their assets to the Assignee chosen by the Company, who acts as a fiduciary similar to a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy. On September 7, 2021, the ABCs were filed with the Bergen County Clerk in Bergen County, New Jersey and filed with the Surrogate Court in the appropriate county, initiating a judicial proceeding. The Assignee has been charged with liquidating the assets for the benefit of the Prime EFS and Shypdirect creditors pursuant to the provisions of the ABC Statute.\nAs a result of Prime EFS and Shypdirect's filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors on September 7, 2021, the Assignee assumed all authority to manage Prime EFS or Shypdirect. Additionally, Prime EFS and Shypdirect no longer conduct any business and are not permitted by the Assignee and ABC Statute to conduct any business. For these reasons, effective September 7, 2021, we relinquished control of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Therefore, we deconsolidated Prime EFS and Shypdirect effective with the filing of executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in September 2021. Further, on October 13, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect filed for dissolution with the Secretary of State of New Jersey. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the results of Prime EFS and Shypdirect prior to the September 7, 2021 filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors with the State of New Jersey.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of Prime EFS and Shypdirect subject to the Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors have been reflected as Assets subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d and Liabilities subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey ( Shyp FX\u201d). On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we executed an asset purchase agreement ( APA\u201d) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years ( DDTI\u201d), including last-mile delivery services using vans and box trucks. The purchase price was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships. The acquisition of DDTI made the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, the Company believes fits in well with its current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network.\nOn November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware ( TLSS Acquisition\u201d). On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express, Inc., a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing, and delivery services in the tri-state area ( Cougar Express\u201d). The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business for five years. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of approximately 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. We believe that the acquisition of Cougar Express fits our current business plan, given Cougar Express's demographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that it would provide us with a long-standing, well-run profitable operation as a step to begin replacing the revenue it lost as a result of Amazon terminating its delivery service provider business. Furthermore, we believe that, because Cougar Express is strategically based in New York and serves the tri-state area, organic growth opportunities will be available for expanding its footprint into our primary base of operations in New Jersey, as well as efficiencies that could be derived by leveraging Shypdirect's operational capabilities.\nOn February 21, 2021, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York ( Shyp CX\u201d). Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations.\nThe following discussion highlights the results of our operations and the principal factors that have affected the Company's consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the valuation of accounts receivable, the useful life of property and equipment, the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of right of use assets and related liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the valuation of beneficial conversion features, and the value of claims against the Company.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operation:\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer's historical payment history, its current credit worthiness, and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe have certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. We evaluate all our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, applying the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced before the effective date whereby the Company elected to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases and (ii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. For contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company's assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether it has the right to direct the use of the asset. We will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.\nOperating lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue recognition and cost of revenue\nWe adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASC is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASC also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer service orders, including significant judgments.\nWe recognize revenues and the related direct costs of such revenue which generally include compensation and related benefits, gas costs, insurance, parking and tolls, truck rental fees, and maintenance fees as of the date the freight is delivered which is when the performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our payment terms are net seven days from acceptance of delivery. We do not incur incremental costs obtaining service orders from our customers, however, if we did, because all of our customer contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized. The revenue that we recognize arises from deliveries of packages on behalf of the Company's customers. Primarily, our performance obligations under these service orders correspond to each delivery of packages that we make under the service agreements. Control of the delivery transfers to the recipient upon delivery. Once this occurs, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.\nManagement has reviewed the revenue disaggregation disclosure requirements pursuant to ASC 606 and determined that no further disaggregation disclosure is required to be presented.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.\nDeconsolidation of subsidiaries\nThe Company accounts for a gain or loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets in accordance with ASC 810-10-40-5. The Company measures the gain or loss as the difference between (a) the aggregate of fair value of any consideration received, the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment and the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the former subsidiary at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated and (b) the carrying amount of the former subsidiary's assets and liabilities or the carrying amount of the group of assets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation.\nWe expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in revenue attributable to Prime EFS's last-mile DSP business of $13,944,991, a decrease in revenue from Shypdirect's mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon of $9,459,668, and a decrease in revenue from other customers of $768,603. These decreases were offset from revenues generated from our newly acquired companies, DDTI and Cougar Express, of $1,188,636 and $2,653,140, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of the Company's total net revenues. As discussed above, approximately 28.5% of our aggregate revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact has caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nWe continue to: (i) seek to replace the lost Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan. In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of DDTI and in March 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cougar Express, as discussed elsewhere.\nCost of Revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our cost of revenues was $5,408,143 compared to $23,284,240 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $17,876,097, or 76.8%. Cost of revenues consists of truck and van rental fees, insurance, gas, maintenance, parking and tolls, and compensation and related benefits. In the first quarter of 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020, which is included in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was consistent with the decrease in revenues.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a gross profit of $87,003, or 1.6% of revenues, as compared to gross profit of $2,542,392, or 9.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,455,389, or 96.6%. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily resulted from a decrease in revenues and a decrease in operational efficiencies in Prime EFS and Shypdirect due to the termination of the Amazon last-mile business and decrease in revenues from our mid-mile and long-haul business. Additionally, as discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses amounted to $6,532,027 as compared to $10,757,943 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4,225,916, or 39.3%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Compensation and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,403,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,335,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,160,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,920,606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>651,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,115,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contingency loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,035,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on lease abandonment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,223,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,532,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,757,943 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompensation and related benefits\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, compensation and related benefits amounted to $1,403,311 as compared to $2,335,388 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $932,077, or 39.9%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the overall decrease in compensation and related benefits as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to a decrease in compensation paid to significant employees and the reduction of staff due to the significant decrease in revenues and operations.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal and professional fees\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, legal and professional fees were $2,160,081 as compared to $3,920,606 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,760,525, or 44.9%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a decrease in legal fees of $35,871 related to a decrease in activities on ongoing legal matters, a decrease in consulting fees of $64,509 and a decrease in stock-based consulting fees of $1,999,749 that we incurred in the 2020 period and not in the 2021. These decreases were offset by an increase in accounting fees of $238,222 incurred, and an increase in other professional fees of $101,382 which primarily consisted of fees for the mailing of proxy and shareholder information.\nRent expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, rent expense was $599,820 as compared to $651,806 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $51,986, or 8.0%. This decrease was attributable to the abandonment of our leased properties which were vacated due to the cessation of the operations of Prime EFS and Shypdirect, offset by an increase in rental space due to the acquisition of Cougar Express. As of December 31, 2021, we abandoned all of our leased properties, except for the Cougar Express premises. The lease of our subsidiary, Cougar Express, expired on December 31, 2021. Cougar Express is holding over in the facility while it attempts to negotiate a lease renewal with its landlord. The holdover rent is 200% of the base rental rate Cougar Express paid in 2021. Alternatively, Cougar Express is exploring options to move its operations to another facility. We expect that, whether Cougar Express renegotiates with its existing landlord or finds new space, it will pay materially higher rent in 2022 and future years.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were $1,115,187 as compared to $814,306 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $300,881, or 36.9%. These increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Double D Trucking and Cougar Express and were offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses due to cost-cutting measures taken. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2022 due to these cost cutting measures.\nContingency loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, contingency loss amounted to $30,000 as compared to $3,035,837 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3,005,837, or 99.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, contingency loss amounted to $30,000 which is related to the accrual of an estimated legal settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, contingency loss consisted of the write off of securities deposits of $164,565 and the recorded of a contingent liability of $2,871,272 which are related to the default on truck leases for non-payment of monthly lease payments and the lessors demand for payment of lease termination fees.\nLoss from lease abandonment\nDue to a reduction in our revenues and the loss of its Amazon revenues, during the second and third quarter of 2021, we abandoned our leased premises related to the ceased operations of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we wrote off the remaining balances of the right of use assets and recorded a loss on lease abandonment of $1,223,628.\nLoss from operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, loss from operations amounted to $6,445,024 as compared to $8,215,551 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,770,527, or 21.6%.\nOther expenses (income)\nTotal other income (expenses) includes interest expense, derivative expense, warrant exercise inducement expense, gain on debt extinguishment, settlement expense, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiaries, and other income. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other expenses (income) consisted of the following:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(349,544 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,377,164 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - related parties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74,959 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(174,947 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrant exercise inducement expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,431,853 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,564,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,847,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on debt extinguishment - related party </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Settlement expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(545,616 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>376,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on deconsolidation of subsidiaries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,363,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Derivative income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,284,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,692,503 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Other Income (Expenses), net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,699,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34,566,407 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, aggregate interest expense was $424,503 and $7,552,111, respectively, a decrease of $7,127,608, or 94.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a 30% default interest penalty of $1,531,335, which was included in interest expense. We did not incur this expense during the 2021 periods. Additionally, the decrease in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in interest-bearing loans due to the conversion of debt to equity, and a decrease in the amortization of original issue discount.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain of the holders of its existing Series E preferred warrants ( Exercising Warrant Holders\u201d). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreements, the Exercising Warrant Holders and we agreed that the Exercising Warrant Holders would cash exercise their existing warrants, into shares of common stock underlying such existing warrants Shares. In order to induce the Exercising Warrant Holders to cash exercise their existing Warrants, the Securities Purchase Agreements provided for the issuance of new warrants ( New Warrants\u201d) with such New Warrants to be issued in an amount equal to 50% of the number of shares acquired by the Existing Warrant Holder through the exercise of existing warrants for cash. The New Warrants are exercisable upon issuance and terminate five years following the initial exercise date. The New Warrants have an exercise price per share of $0.01. In connection with the exercise of these existing warrants for cash, the Company issued an aggregate of 205,626,862 New Warrants. The New Warrants issued in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreements were considered inducement warrants and are classified in equity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value of the New Warrants issued was $4,431,853 and were expensed as warrant exercise inducement expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate net gain on extinguishment of debt was $1,713,592 and $7,847,073, respectively, a decrease of $6,133,481, or 78.2%. The gains on debt extinguishment were attributable to the settlement of convertible debt and warrants, the settlement of secured merchant loans, the conversion of convertible debt, the settlement of a note payable - related party, and the settlement of other payables.\nOn December 17, 2020, we issued 18,685,477 common shares to certain August 2019 equity and debt purchasers as settlement related to the difference between $2.50, the purchase price, and $0.40. These shares were valued at $545,616, or $0.029 per share, based on the quoted trading price on the date of grant. In connection with these shares, we recorded settlement expense of $545,616.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded other income of $194,823 and $376,750. Other income was primarily related to the collection of rental income from the sublease of excess office, warehouse, and parking spaces. As of December 31, 2021, the Company abandoned substantially all of its leased properties and will no longer receive sublease income in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain on deconsolidation of subsidiaries of $12,363,449. We did not recognize this gain during the 2020 period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, derivative income (expense) was $3,284,306 and $(34,692,503), respectively, a change of $37,976,809. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a derivative income (expense) related to the calculated initial derivative fair value of conversion options and warrants. Additionally, we adjusted our derivative liabilities to fair value and recorded derivative expense or income.\nNet Income (Loss)\nDue to factors discussed above, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net income (loss) amounted to $6,254,790 and $(42,781,958), respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, which included a deemed dividend related to price protection, beneficial conversion features on preferred stock, and the dividends accrued on Series E and Series G preferred stock of $2,650,217 and $19,223,242, amounted to $3,604,573, or $0.00 per basic and diluted common share, and $(62,005,200), or $(0.08) per basic and diluted common share, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a cash balance of $6,067,692 and $579,283, respectively. Our working capital was $5,740,655 on December 31, 2021. We reported a net increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 of $5,488,409 primarily as a result of net cash proceeds received from the sale of Series E preferred stock units of $3,590,500, net cash proceeds received from the sale of Series G preferred stock units of $5,479,560, and cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $4,226,383, offset by the use of net cash for acquisitions of $2,123,115, the repayment of notes payable of $991,468, the repayment of note payable - related party of $500,000, net repayment of related party advances of $55,041, and by cash used in operations of $3,937,036.\nWe believe that our existing working capital and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our operating needs and debt requirements for the next twelve months.\nAdditionally, we are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund our operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of shares of common stock, the sale of Series E and Series G preferred stock, and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and notes payable, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the future, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations.\nRecent Financing Activities\nQ1/Q2 2020 convertible debt and related warrants\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold to certain investors convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,068,000 (the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes\u201d) and warrants to purchase up to 827,200 shares of the Company's common stock (the Q1/Q2 2020 Warrants\u201d). We received net proceeds of $1,880,000, which is net of a 10% original issue discounts of $188,000. The Q1/Q2 2020 Notes initially bore interest at 6% per annum and became due and payable on the date that is the 24-month anniversary of the original issue date of the respective Q1/Q2 2020 Note. During the existence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes), which included, amongst other events, any default in the payment of principal and interest payments (including Q1/Q2 2020 Note Amortization Payments) under any Q1/Q2 2020 Note or any other Indebtedness (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes), interest accrued at the lesser of (i) the rate of 18% per annum, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. Commencing on the thirteenth month anniversary of the issuance of each Q1/Q2 2020 Note, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule (each, a Q1/Q2 2020 Note Amortization Payment\u201d), was due and payable, until the Maturity Date (as defined in the applicable Q1/Q2 2020 Note), at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable on such Q1/Q2 2020 Note was immediately due and payable.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom the original issue date of a Q1/Q2 2020 Note until such Q1/Q2 2020 Note is no longer outstanding, such Q1/Q2 2020 Note was convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the holder. The Conversion Price\u201d in effect on any Conversion Date (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes) means, as of any date of determination, $0.40 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein and summarized below. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes) has occurred, regardless of whether it has been cured or remains ongoing, the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes are convertible at the lower of: (i) $0.40 and (ii) 70% of the second lowest closing price of the common stock as reported on the Trading Market (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes) during the 20 consecutive Trading Day (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes) period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion. All such Conversion Price determinations are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nIn the third fiscal quarter of 2020, the great majority of principal amount of Q1/Q2 2020 Notes were exchanged for Common Stock at the conversion price that applied if an Event of Default occurred. It is the Company's position (and it was the Company's intent at issuance) that, to the extent the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes were converted for Common Stock at the advantageous conversion price applicable to post-Events of Default, the Q1/Q2 Notes are not also entitled to receive the Mandatory Default Payment (as defined in the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes) of 130% of principal amount. However, since a note holder could conceivably disagree with the Company's position in this regard, the Company has decided, out of an abundance of caution and despite its confidence that its construction of the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes is the only correct one, to accrue a reserve as if a note holder were entitled both to convert its Q1/Q2 Notes at the advantageous conversion price applicable to post-Events of Default and to receive the Mandatory Default Payment of 130% on the entire original principal amount of Q1/Q2 2020 Notes. Accordingly. as of March 31, 2021, convertible notes payable and default interest due related to the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes amounted to $736,865, which consists of $801,400 of principal and default penalty balances due and is net of unamortized debt discount of $64,535.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company and each investor entered into a letter agreement whereby the investor waived its right to any Mandatory Default Payment. Accordingly, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we reversed the accrued Mandatory Penalty amount due of $664,400 and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $664,400. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 28,358,841 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of all remaining principal and interest balances due aggregating $277,916.\nAs of December 31, 2021, convertible notes payable and default interest due related to the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes amounted to $0. On December 31, 2020, on the same construction of the Q1/Q2 Notes, convertible notes payable and default interest due related to the Q1/Q2 2020 Notes amounted to $717,852, which consists of $801,400 of principal and default penalty balances due and is net of unamortized debt discount of $83,548.\nApril 20, 2020 convertible debt\nOn April 20, 2020, we issued to an investor a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $456,500 (the April 20 Note\u201d). The April 20 Note contained a 10% original issue discount amounting to $41,500 for a purchase price of $415,000. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the April 20 Note because the investor converted previous notes and accrued interest due to him in the amount of $195,000 into the April 20 Note. In connection with the conversion of notes payable to the April 20 Note, we recorded a loss from debt extinguishment of $220,000. The April 20 Note bore interest at 6% per annum and becomes due and payable on April 20, 2022 (the April 20 Note Maturity Date\u201d). During the existence of an Event of Default (as defined in the April 20 Note), which includes, amongst other events, any default in the payment of principal and interest payment (including any April 20 Note Amortization Payments) under any note or any other indebtedness, interest accrues at the lesser of (i) the rate of 18% per annum, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. Commencing on the thirteenth month anniversary of the April 20 Note, monthly payments of interest and monthly principal payments, based on a 12-month amortization schedule, will be due and payable (each, an April 20 Note Amortization Payment\u201d), until the April 20 Note Maturity Date, at which time all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due and payable under the April 20 Note will be immediately due and payable. The April 20 Note Amortization Payments will be made in cash unless the investor requests payment in the Company's common stock in lieu of a cash payment (each, an April 20 Note Stock Payment\u201d). If the investor requests an April 20 Note Stock Payment, the number of shares of common stock issued will be based on the amount of the applicable April 20 Note Amortization Payment divided by 80% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the April 20 Note) during the five Trading Day (as defined in the April 20 Note) period prior to the due date of the April 20 Note Amortization Payment.\nUntil the April 20 Note was no longer outstanding, it was convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of common stock at the option of the investor. The Conversion Price\u201d in effect on any Conversion Date (as defined in the April 20 Note) means, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, the lower of: (i) $0.40 and (ii) 70% of the second lowest closing price of the common stock as reported on the Trading Market (as defined in the April 20 Note) during the 20 consecutive Trading Day (as defined in the April 20 Note) period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion. All such Conversion Price determinations are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 15,923,322 shares of our common stock upon the conversion of all remaining principal and interest balances due aggregating $95,540. Hence, as of December 31, 2021, convertible notes payable and default interest due related to the April 20 Note amounted to $0. On December 31, 2020, convertible notes payable related to the April 20 Note amounted to $69,300, which consists of $69,300 of default penalty balance due.\nSale of Series E Preferred Stock\nOn October 8, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the investors party thereto (collectively the Investors\u201d) pursuant to which the Investors agreed to purchase units, severally and not jointly, which consisted of an aggregate of (i) 47,977 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series E\u201d) and (ii) warrants (the Warrants\u201d) to purchase 23,988,500 shares of the Company's common stock which are equal to 50% of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E if the Series E were converted on October 8, 2020 (the October 2020 Series E Offering\u201d). The gross proceeds to the Company were $640,000, or $13.34 per unit which is the stated value of each Series E share. We paid fees of $35,000 and received net proceeds of $605,000. The initial exercise price of the Warrants related to the October 2020 Series E Offering is $0.04 per share, subject to adjustment. Due to down-round provisions in the Warrants, the number of warrants was increased from 23,988,500 warrants to 95,954,000 warrants, and the exercise price was reduced to $0.01 per share.\nOn December 28, 2020 and December 30, 2020, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with investors pursuant to which the Investors agreed to purchase units, severally and not jointly, which consisted of an aggregate of (i) 57,400 shares of Series E and (ii) Warrants to purchase 76,571,429 shares of the Company's common stock which are equal to 1,334 warrants for each share of Series E purchased (the December 2020 Series E Offering\u201d). The gross proceeds to the Company were $670,000, or $11.67 per unit. We paid fees of $112,000 and received net proceeds of $558,000. The initial exercise price of the Warrants related to the December 2020 Series E Offering is $0.01 per share, subject to adjustment.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with investors pursuant to which the Investors agreed to purchase units, severally and not jointly, which consisted of an aggregate of (i) 310,992 shares of Series E and (ii) Warrants to purchase 414,857,146 shares of the Company's common stock which are equal to 1,334 warrants for each for each share of Series E purchased (the Q1 2021 Series E Offering\u201d).

This drop, together with anti-dilution protection features contained in the August 2019 Notes and August 2019 Warrants that were triggered upon the issuance of convertible debt beginning in January 2020, caused the conversion prices of most of the Company's outstanding notes and the exercise price of many of the Company's outstanding warrants, to fall to $0.006. Beginning in February 2020, note holders began converting the outstanding principal of their notes into substantial quantities of shares of the Company's common stock.\nDuring the period from February 25, 2020 to December 31, 2020, we issued 1,013,408,088 shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of convertible notes payable and default interest of $8,353,965, accrued interest of $553,596, and fees of $9,080.

The conversion ratio was based on the Series E certificate of designation, as amended.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 52,482,141 shares of our common stock in connection with the cashless exercise of 98,557,429 warrants. The exercise price was based on contractual terms of the related warrant.\nIn May and June 2021, we issued 68,571,429 shares of our common stock and received proceeds of $685,714 from the exercise of 68,571,429 warrants at $0.01 per share.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2021, we issued 325,539,430 shares of our common stock and received proceeds of $3,254,955 from the exercise of 325,539,430 warrants at $0.01 per share.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2021, we issued 28,571,429 shares of our common stock and received proceeds of $285,714 from the exercise of 28,571,429 warrants at $0.01 per share.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsequently, the total number of shares of common stock outstanding has increased from 11,832,603 on December 31, 2019, to 2,926,528,666 on December 31, 2021.\nTo enable the Company to meet these commitments, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously adopted a resolution seeking stockholder approval to authorize the Board of Directors to amend the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 shares to 4,000,000,000 shares (the Authorized Share Increase Amendment\u201d). Stockholder approval for the Authorized Share Increase Amendment was obtained on June 26, 2020 from stockholders that held at least 51% of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, as of the record date of June 26, 2020. These consents constituted a sufficient number of votes to approve the Authorized Share Increase Amendment under the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law. Pursuant to applicable securities laws and Section 78.390 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Company prepared and mailed an Information Statement to its stockholders of record on the record date beginning on June 30, 2020.

The Company filed a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C regarding the stockholders' consent to the Authorized Share Increase Amendment with the SEC on March 3, 2021.This consent was sufficient to approve the 2021 Amendment under Nevada law. The Company filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C on March 15, 2021 and first mailed that information statement to stockholders on March 15, 2021. The 2021 Amendment became effective in April 2021 which was at least twenty calendar days after the Information Statement was first sent to stockholders.\nCash Flows\nOperating activities\nNet cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $4,085,687.

Since our inception, we have incurred recurring losses, including a loss from operations of $6,445,024 and $8,215,551 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Until such time that we implement our growth through acquisition strategy, we expect to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future, mostly due to corporate overhead and costs of being a public company.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 343,118 shares of our Series E preferred stock for net proceeds of $3,590,500 and issued an aggregate of 615,000 shares of our Series G preferred stock for net proceeds of $5,479,560. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of Cougar Express and DDTI, the repayment of debt, and for working capital purposes. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we received proceeds of $4,226,383 from the exercise of stock warrants. As such, we expect that our cash as of December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the financial statements.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, subsequent to December 31, 2021, we received additional net proceeds of $855,000 from the sale of Series G preferred stock and $245,714 from the exercise of warrants which only further improve the Company's financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected the Company's businesses, as well as those of the Company's customers and their third-party suppliers and sellers. To serve the Company's customers while also providing for the safety of the Company's employees and service providers, the Company has adapted numerous aspects of its logistics and transportation processes. The Company continues to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt its operations to address federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that the Company determines to be in the best interests of its employees, customers, and communities. The impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to it had some effects on the Company's results of operations. Effects include increased fulfilment costs and cost of sales, primarily due to investments in employee hiring, pay, and benefits, as well as costs to maintain safe workplaces, and higher shipping costs. The Company continues to be affected by possible procurement and shipping delays, supply chain interruptions, higher product demand in certain categories, lower product demand in other categories, and increased fulfilment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and it is not possible to determine the duration and spread of the pandemic or such actions, the ultimate impact on the Company's results of operations during 2022, or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's results of operations.\nWe will continue to: (i) seek to replace its last-mile DSP Amazon business and supplement its mid-mile and long-haul Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute its restructuring plan. We are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common and preferred shares and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and notes payable, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to replace its Amazon business, to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues, or operating results during the periods presented.\nRecently Enacted Accounting Standards\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report.", "summary": "This report discusses the financial condition and results of operations for Transportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. (TLSS) and its subsidiaries. TLSS operates as a logistics and transportation company specializing in e-commerce fulfillment and transportation services. The report highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, business operations, acquisitions, and critical accounting policies.\n\nThe report notes a significant decrease in revenues from $25.8 million in 2020 to $5.5 million in 2021, largely due to the termination of contracts with Amazon. The termination of contracts led to a decline in gross profit and an increase in operating expenses, resulting in a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $62 million in 2020 and a net income of $3.6 million in 2021. The report also highlights the company's efforts to seek new customers and strategic relationships while executing a restructuring plan.\n\nAdditionally, the report provides insights on critical accounting policies, including accounts receivable, impairment of long-lived assets, derivative financial instruments, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. It discusses the adoption of ASU 2017-11, leases, and deconsolidation of subsidiaries.

However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that may affect the results of our operations include, among others: our ability to successfully execute our business strategies, including integration of acquisitions and the future acquisition of other businesses to grow our Company; customers' cancellation on short notice of master service agreements from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue or our failure to renew such master service agreements on favorable terms or at all; our ability to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor to meet the requirements of our labor-intensive business or labor difficulties which could have an effect on our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts; the ultimate geographic spread, duration and severity of the coronavirus outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken, or actions that may be taken, by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or ameliorate its effects; our failure to compete effectively in our highly competitive industry, which could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our market share and harm our financial performance; our ability to adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry's and customers' evolving demands; our history of losses, deficiency in working capital and a stockholders' deficit and our inability to achieve sustained profitability; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future; our substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations; the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business; and changes in general market, economic, social and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\n 23 \n \nOther important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements. You should read this report in its entirety and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward-looking statements, even in the event that our situation changes in the future, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.\nEffects of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and their third-party suppliers and sellers.

We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.\nThe impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to it had some effects on our results of operations. Effects of the pandemic have included increased fulfillment costs, primarily due to investments in employee hiring, pay, and benefits, as well as costs to maintain safe workplaces, and higher shipping costs. We expect to continue to be affected by possible procurement and shipping delays, supply chain interruptions, higher product demand in certain categories, lower product demand in other categories, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and it is not possible to determine the duration and spread of the pandemic or such actions, the ultimate impact on our results of operations during 2022, or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations.\nOverview\nTransportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. ( TLSS\u201d or the Company\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company operates through its active subsidiaries as a logistics and transportation company specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services for predominantly online retailers.\nWe are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns its own transportation equipment. We employ our own drivers and use the services of independent contractors who may use their own vehicles.\nBetween June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through two New Jersey-based subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries were Prime EFS, LLC, which conducted a last-mile business focused on deliveries to retail consumers for our primary customer in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania ( Prime EFS\u201d), and Shypdirect, LLC ( Shypdirect\u201d), which formed in July 2018 and focused on, and conducted, our long-haul and mid-mile delivery businesses.\nThe great bulk of Prime EFS's business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the Prime EFS DSP Program\u201d) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. ( Amazon\u201d). In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Amazon made clear to Prime EFS that Amazon's decision not to renew the DSP agreement was part of a well-publicized initiative by Amazon to restructure how it would be delivering its last-mile services and did not reflect the quality of the services provided by Prime EFS. Prime EFS ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon's non-renewal of the Prime EFS DSP Program.\nShypdirect conducted its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc., last amended on August 24, 2020 (the Program Agreement\u201d). Under that agreement, Shypdirect provided transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services for Amazon and its customers. On July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (the Shypdirect Termination Notice\u201d). On August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, Prime EFS would release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and Prime EFS would covenant not to sue Amazon (the Aug. 3 Proposal\u201d). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal. The Program Agreement expired on May 14, 2021. In June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of our total net revenues. Approximately 28.5% of our revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nOn August 16, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect, executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in the State of New Jersey pursuant to N.J.S.A. \u00a72A:19-1, et seq. (the ABC Statute\u201d), assigning all Prime EFS and Shypdirect assets to Terri Jane Freedman as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors (the Assignee\u201d) and filing for dissolution. An Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors,\u201d general assignment\u201d or ABC\u201d in New Jersey is a state-law, voluntary, judicially-supervised corporate liquidation and unwinding similar to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process found in the United States Bankruptcy Code. In an ABC, debtor companies, here Prime EFS and Shypdirect, together referred to as the Assignors,\u201dexecute Deeds of Assignment, assigning all of their assets to the Assignee chosen by the Company, who acts as a fiduciary similar to a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy. On September 7, 2021, the ABCs were filed with the Bergen County Clerk in Bergen County, New Jersey and filed with the Surrogate Court in the appropriate county, initiating a judicial proceeding. The Assignee has been charged with liquidating the assets for the benefit of the Prime EFS and Shypdirect creditors pursuant to the provisions of the ABC Statute.\nAs a result of Prime EFS and Shypdirect's filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors on September 7, 2021, the Assignee assumed all authority to manage Prime EFS or Shypdirect. Additionally, Prime EFS and Shypdirect no longer conduct any business and are not permitted by the Assignee and ABC Statute to conduct any business. For these reasons, effective September 7, 2021, we relinquished control of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Therefore, we deconsolidated Prime EFS and Shypdirect effective with the filing of executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in September 2021. Further, on October 13, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect filed for dissolution with the Secretary of State of New Jersey. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the results of Prime EFS and Shypdirect prior to the September 7, 2021 filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors with the State of New Jersey.\n 24 \n \nAs of December 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of Prime EFS and Shypdirect subject to the Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors have been reflected as Assets subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d and Liabilities subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey ( Shyp FX\u201d). On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we executed an asset purchase agreement ( APA\u201d) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years ( DDTI\u201d), including last-mile delivery services using vans and box trucks. The purchase price was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships. The acquisition of DDTI made the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, the Company believes fits in well with its current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network.\nOn November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware ( TLSS Acquisition\u201d). On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express, Inc., a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing, and delivery services in the tri-state area ( Cougar Express\u201d). The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business for five years. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of approximately 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. We believe that the acquisition of Cougar Express fits our current business plan, given Cougar Express's demographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that it would provide us with a long-standing, well-run profitable operation as a step to begin replacing the revenue it lost as a result of Amazon terminating its delivery service provider business. Furthermore, we believe that, because Cougar Express is strategically based in New York and serves the tri-state area, organic growth opportunities will be available for expanding its footprint into our primary base of operations in New Jersey, as well as efficiencies that could be derived by leveraging Shypdirect's operational capabilities.\nOn February 21, 2021, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York ( Shyp CX\u201d). Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations.\nThe following discussion highlights the results of our operations and the principal factors that have affected the Company's consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the valuation of accounts receivable, the useful life of property and equipment, the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of right of use assets and related liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the valuation of beneficial conversion features, and the value of claims against the Company.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operation:\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer's historical payment history, its current credit worthiness, and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe have certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. We evaluate all our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.\n 25 \n \nIn July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, applying the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced before the effective date whereby the Company elected to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases and (ii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. For contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company's assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether it has the right to direct the use of the asset. We will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.\nOperating lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue recognition and cost of revenue\nWe adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASC is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASC also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer service orders, including significant judgments.\nWe recognize revenues and the related direct costs of such revenue which generally include compensation and related benefits, gas costs, insurance, parking and tolls, truck rental fees, and maintenance fees as of the date the freight is delivered which is when the performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our payment terms are net seven days from acceptance of delivery. We do not incur incremental costs obtaining service orders from our customers, however, if we did, because all of our customer contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized. The revenue that we recognize arises from deliveries of packages on behalf of the Company's customers. Primarily, our performance obligations under these service orders correspond to each delivery of packages that we make under the service agreements. Control of the delivery transfers to the recipient upon delivery. Once this occurs, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.\nManagement has reviewed the revenue disaggregation disclosure requirements pursuant to ASC 606 and determined that no further disaggregation disclosure is required to be presented.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.\nDeconsolidation of subsidiaries\nThe Company accounts for a gain or loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets in accordance with ASC 810-10-40-5. The Company measures the gain or loss as the difference between (a) the aggregate of fair value of any consideration received, the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment and the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the former subsidiary at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated and (b) the carrying amount of the former subsidiary's assets and liabilities or the carrying amount of the group of assets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation.\nWe expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\n 26 \n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The financial information below is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $5,495,146 as compared to $25,826,632 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $20,331,486, or 78.7%. This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in revenue attributable to Prime EFS's last-mile DSP business of $13,944,991, a decrease in revenue from Shypdirect's mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon of $9,459,668, and a decrease in revenue from other customers of $768,603. These decreases were offset from revenues generated from our newly acquired companies, DDTI and Cougar Express, of $1,188,636 and $2,653,140, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of the Company's total net revenues. As discussed above, approximately 28.5% of our aggregate revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact has caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nWe continue to: (i) seek to replace the lost Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan. In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of DDTI and in March 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cougar Express, as discussed elsewhere.\nCost of Revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our cost of revenues was $5,408,143 compared to $23,284,240 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $17,876,097, or 76.8%. Cost of revenues consists of truck and van rental fees, insurance, gas, maintenance, parking and tolls, and compensation and related benefits. In the first quarter of 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020, which is included in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was consistent with the decrease in revenues.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a gross profit of $87,003, or 1.6% of revenues, as compared to gross profit of $2,542,392, or 9.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,455,389, or 96.6%. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily resulted from a decrease in revenues and a decrease in operational efficiencies in Prime EFS and Shypdirect due to the termination of the Amazon last-mile business and decrease in revenues from our mid-mile and long-haul business. Additionally, as discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses amounted to $6,532,027 as compared to $10,757,943 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4,225,916, or 39.3%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses consisted of the following:\n\nCompensation and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are forward-looking statements\u201d made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). These statements often can be identified using terms such as may,\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d approximate\u201d or continue,\u201d or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that may affect the results of our operations include, among others: our ability to successfully execute our business strategies, including integration of acquisitions and the future acquisition of other businesses to grow our Company; customers' cancellation on short notice of master service agreements from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue or our failure to renew such master service agreements on favorable terms or at all; our ability to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor to meet the requirements of our labor-intensive business or labor difficulties which could have an effect on our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts; the ultimate geographic spread, duration and severity of the coronavirus outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken, or actions that may be taken, by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or ameliorate its effects; our failure to compete effectively in our highly competitive industry, which could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our market share and harm our financial performance; our ability to adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry's and customers' evolving demands; our history of losses, deficiency in working capital and a stockholders' deficit and our inability to achieve sustained profitability; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future; our substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations; the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business; and changes in general market, economic, social and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\n 23 \n \nOther important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements. You should read this report in its entirety and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward-looking statements, even in the event that our situation changes in the future, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.\nEffects of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and their third-party suppliers and sellers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have adapted numerous aspects of our logistics and transportation processes. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.\nThe impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to it had some effects on our results of operations. Effects of the pandemic have included increased fulfillment costs, primarily due to investments in employee hiring, pay, and benefits, as well as costs to maintain safe workplaces, and higher shipping costs. We expect to continue to be affected by possible procurement and shipping delays, supply chain interruptions, higher product demand in certain categories, lower product demand in other categories, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and it is not possible to determine the duration and spread of the pandemic or such actions, the ultimate impact on our results of operations during 2022, or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations.\nOverview\nTransportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. ( TLSS\u201d or the Company\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company operates through its active subsidiaries as a logistics and transportation company specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services for predominantly online retailers.\nWe are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns its own transportation equipment. We employ our own drivers and use the services of independent contractors who may use their own vehicles.\nBetween June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through two New Jersey-based subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries were Prime EFS, LLC, which conducted a last-mile business focused on deliveries to retail consumers for our primary customer in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania ( Prime EFS\u201d), and Shypdirect, LLC ( Shypdirect\u201d), which formed in July 2018 and focused on, and conducted, our long-haul and mid-mile delivery businesses.\nThe great bulk of Prime EFS's business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the Prime EFS DSP Program\u201d) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. ( Amazon\u201d). In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Amazon made clear to Prime EFS that Amazon's decision not to renew the DSP agreement was part of a well-publicized initiative by Amazon to restructure how it would be delivering its last-mile services and did not reflect the quality of the services provided by Prime EFS. Prime EFS ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon's non-renewal of the Prime EFS DSP Program.\nShypdirect conducted its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc., last amended on August 24, 2020 (the Program Agreement\u201d). Under that agreement, Shypdirect provided transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services for Amazon and its customers. On July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement between Amazon and Shypdirect effective as of November 14, 2020 (the Shypdirect Termination Notice\u201d). On August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, Prime EFS would release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and Prime EFS would covenant not to sue Amazon (the Aug. 3 Proposal\u201d). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal. The Program Agreement expired on May 14, 2021. In June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of our total net revenues. Approximately 28.5% of our revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nOn August 16, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect, executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in the State of New Jersey pursuant to N.J.S.A. \u00a72A:19-1, et seq. (the ABC Statute\u201d), assigning all Prime EFS and Shypdirect assets to Terri Jane Freedman as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors (the Assignee\u201d) and filing for dissolution. An Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors,\u201d general assignment\u201d or ABC\u201d in New Jersey is a state-law, voluntary, judicially-supervised corporate liquidation and unwinding similar to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process found in the United States Bankruptcy Code. In an ABC, debtor companies, here Prime EFS and Shypdirect, together referred to as the Assignors,\u201dexecute Deeds of Assignment, assigning all of their assets to the Assignee chosen by the Company, who acts as a fiduciary similar to a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy. On September 7, 2021, the ABCs were filed with the Bergen County Clerk in Bergen County, New Jersey and filed with the Surrogate Court in the appropriate county, initiating a judicial proceeding. The Assignee has been charged with liquidating the assets for the benefit of the Prime EFS and Shypdirect creditors pursuant to the provisions of the ABC Statute.\nAs a result of Prime EFS and Shypdirect's filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors on September 7, 2021, the Assignee assumed all authority to manage Prime EFS or Shypdirect. Additionally, Prime EFS and Shypdirect no longer conduct any business and are not permitted by the Assignee and ABC Statute to conduct any business. For these reasons, effective September 7, 2021, we relinquished control of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Therefore, we deconsolidated Prime EFS and Shypdirect effective with the filing of executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in September 2021. Further, on October 13, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect filed for dissolution with the Secretary of State of New Jersey. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the results of Prime EFS and Shypdirect prior to the September 7, 2021 filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors with the State of New Jersey.\n 24 \n \nAs of December 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of Prime EFS and Shypdirect subject to the Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors have been reflected as Assets subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d and Liabilities subject to assignment for benefit of creditors\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey ( Shyp FX\u201d). On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we executed an asset purchase agreement ( APA\u201d) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years ( DDTI\u201d), including last-mile delivery services using vans and box trucks. The purchase price was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships. The acquisition of DDTI made the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, the Company believes fits in well with its current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network.\nOn November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware ( TLSS Acquisition\u201d). On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express, Inc., a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing, and delivery services in the tri-state area ( Cougar Express\u201d). The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business for five years. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of approximately 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. We believe that the acquisition of Cougar Express fits our current business plan, given Cougar Express's demographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that it would provide us with a long-standing, well-run profitable operation as a step to begin replacing the revenue it lost as a result of Amazon terminating its delivery service provider business. Furthermore, we believe that, because Cougar Express is strategically based in New York and serves the tri-state area, organic growth opportunities will be available for expanding its footprint into our primary base of operations in New Jersey, as well as efficiencies that could be derived by leveraging Shypdirect's operational capabilities.\nOn February 21, 2021, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York ( Shyp CX\u201d). Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations.\nThe following discussion highlights the results of our operations and the principal factors that have affected the Company's consolidated financial condition as well as its liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the valuation of accounts receivable, the useful life of property and equipment, the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of right of use assets and related liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the valuation of beneficial conversion features, and the value of claims against the Company.\nWe have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operation:\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer's historical payment history, its current credit worthiness, and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe have certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. We evaluate all our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.\n 25 \n \nIn July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, applying the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced before the effective date whereby the Company elected to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases and (ii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. For contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract the Company assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company's assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether it has the right to direct the use of the asset. We will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.\nOperating lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue recognition and cost of revenue\nWe adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASC is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASC also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer service orders, including significant judgments.\nWe recognize revenues and the related direct costs of such revenue which generally include compensation and related benefits, gas costs, insurance, parking and tolls, truck rental fees, and maintenance fees as of the date the freight is delivered which is when the performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our payment terms are net seven days from acceptance of delivery. We do not incur incremental costs obtaining service orders from our customers, however, if we did, because all of our customer contracts are less than a year in duration, any contract costs incurred would be expensed rather than capitalized. The revenue that we recognize arises from deliveries of packages on behalf of the Company's customers. Primarily, our performance obligations under these service orders correspond to each delivery of packages that we make under the service agreements. Control of the delivery transfers to the recipient upon delivery. Once this occurs, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.\nManagement has reviewed the revenue disaggregation disclosure requirements pursuant to ASC 606 and determined that no further disaggregation disclosure is required to be presented.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.\nDeconsolidation of subsidiaries\nThe Company accounts for a gain or loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets in accordance with ASC 810-10-40-5. The Company measures the gain or loss as the difference between (a) the aggregate of fair value of any consideration received, the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment and the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the former subsidiary at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated and (b) the carrying amount of the former subsidiary's assets and liabilities or the carrying amount of the group of assets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation.\nWe expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\n 26 \n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The financial information below is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,495,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,826,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,408,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,284,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,542,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,532,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,757,943 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,445,024 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,215,551 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expenses), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,699,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,566,407 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,254,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,781,958 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deemed dividend related to ratchet adjustment and beneficial conversion features </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,650,217 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,223,242 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,604,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,005,200 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $5,495,146 as compared to $25,826,632 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $20,331,486, or 78.7%. This decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in revenue attributable to Prime EFS's last-mile DSP business of $13,944,991, a decrease in revenue from Shypdirect's mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon of $9,459,668, and a decrease in revenue from other customers of $768,603. These decreases were offset from revenues generated from our newly acquired companies, DDTI and Cougar Express, of $1,188,636 and $2,653,140, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of the Company's total net revenues. As discussed above, approximately 28.5% of our aggregate revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect's now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect's Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact has caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.\nWe continue to: (i) seek to replace the lost Amazon business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities, while continuing to execute our restructuring plan. In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of DDTI and in March 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cougar Express, as discussed elsewhere.\nCost of Revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our cost of revenues was $5,408,143 compared to $23,284,240 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $17,876,097, or 76.8%. Cost of revenues consists of truck and van rental fees, insurance, gas, maintenance, parking and tolls, and compensation and related benefits. In the first quarter of 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020, which is included in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was consistent with the decrease in revenues.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a gross profit of $87,003, or 1.6% of revenues, as compared to gross profit of $2,542,392, or 9.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2,455,389, or 96.6%. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily resulted from a decrease in revenues and a decrease in operational efficiencies in Prime EFS and Shypdirect due to the termination of the Amazon last-mile business and decrease in revenues from our mid-mile and long-haul business. Additionally, as discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, Prime EFS received a bill for approximately $304,000 for excess wear and tear on trucks that were rented for its last-mile DSP business that terminated in September 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses amounted to $6,532,027 as compared to $10,757,943 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4,225,916, or 39.3%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses consisted of the following:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Compensation and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,403,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,335,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,160,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,920,606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>651,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,115,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contingency loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,035,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on lease abandonment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,223,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,532,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,757,943 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompensation and"}
