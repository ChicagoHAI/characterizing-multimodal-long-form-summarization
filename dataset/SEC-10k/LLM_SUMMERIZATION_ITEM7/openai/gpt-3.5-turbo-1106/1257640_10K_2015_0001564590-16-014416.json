TiO2 is used for a variety of manufacturing applications, including plastics, paints, paper and other industrial products. During 2015, approximately one-half of our sales volumes were sold into European markets. We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with an estimated 18% share of European TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. In addition, we estimate we have a 15% share of North American TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. Our production facilities are located throughout Europe and North America.\nWe consider TiO2 to be a quality of life\u201d product, with demand affected by gross domestic product, or GDP, and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world. Over the long-term, we expect demand for TiO2 will grow by 2% to 3% per year, consistent with our expectations for the long-term growth in GDP. However, even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market, demand for TiO2 in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in GDP, in part due to relative changes in the TiO2 inventory levels of our customers. We believe that our customers' inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market TiO2 selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product. Although certain of our TiO2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service.\nThe factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Our TiO2 sales and production volumes,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> TiO2 selling prices,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Manufacturing costs, particularly raw materials such as third-party feedstock ore, maintenance and energy-related expenses, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Currency exchange rates (particularly the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur key performance indicators are our TiO2 average selling prices, our level of TiO2 sales and production volumes and the cost of our third-party feedstock ore. TiO2 selling prices generally follow industry trends and the selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures.\nIn addition, our effective income tax rate in both 2014 and 2015 was impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below.\nExecutive summary\nWe reported a net loss of $173.6 million, or $1.50 per share for 2015 compared to net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014. We reported a net loss in 2015 primarily due to lower income from operations, the recognition of an aggregate $159.0 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations, the recognition of an aggregate $12.0 million pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charge on our investment in a marketable equity security, and a $21.7 million charge associated with the implementation of certain workforce reductions. Comparability of our results was also impacted by lower average selling prices in 2015, partially offset by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and other production costs (primarily raw materials) and the net effect of changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe reported net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014 compared to a net loss of $102.0 million, or $.88 per share for 2013. We reported net income in 2014 compared to a loss in 2013 principally due to improved results from operations primarily resulting from lower raw material costs and higher production volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices in 2014 as well as a 2013 litigation settlement charge and unabsorbed fixed production and other costs associated with the labor lockout at our Canadian plant as further discussed below.\nOur net loss in 2015 includes:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the recognition of an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations of $159.0 million ($1.37 per share), mostly recognized in the second quarter,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the third quarter recognition of an aggregate pre-tax OTTI loss on our investment in a marketable equity security of $12.0 million ($7.8 million, or $.07 per share, net of income tax benefit), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> a pre-tax charge of $21.7 million ($18.5 million, or $.16 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to workforce reduction costs, mostly recognized in the second quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net income in 2014 includes an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million ($.04 per share) related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions (mostly in the second quarter).\nOur net loss in 2013 includes:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> a pre-tax litigation settlement charge of $35 million ($22.5 million, or $.19 per share, net of income tax benefit),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> approximately $28 million aggregate costs ($21 million, or $.18 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to unabsorbed fixed production and other costs as a result of the Canadian plant lockout, and costs associated with the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement reached with our Canadian workforce, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> an aggregate charge of $8.9 million ($5.8 million, or $.05 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to the voluntary prepayment of $390 million principal amount of our term loan, consisting of the write-off of original issue discount costs and deferred financing costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto, the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation, income tax and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ significantly from previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Long-lived assets - We recognize an impairment charge associated with our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever we determine that recovery of such long-lived asset is not probable. Such determination is made in accordance with the applicable GAAP requirements of Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 360-10-35 Property, Plant and Equipment and is based upon, among other things, estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset. Significant judgment is\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> required in estimating such cash flows. Adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future. We do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in ASC Topic 360-10-35 are present. We did not evaluate any long-lived assets for impairment during 2015 because no such impairment indicators were present.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Benefit plans - We maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions, or OPEB, plans. The amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and OPEB expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and OPEB costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions, including discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected health care trend rates and expected mortality. Variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases, as applicable, in the recognized pension and OPEB obligations, pension and OPEB expenses and funding requirements. These assumptions are more fully described below under Defined Benefit Pension Plans\u201d and OPEB Plans.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Income taxes - We recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying jurisdiction in which we operate are netted and presented as either a noncurrent deferred income tax asset or liability, as applicable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more-likely-than-not be realized in the future, resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor example, at December 31, 2015 we have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $683 million for German corporate purposes and $96 million for German trade tax purposes) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $86 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the U.S. federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the U.S. state income tax.\nPrior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expect to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, which as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report have been driven in large part by the trend in our average TiO2 selling prices over such periods as well as the $21.1 million pre-tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the implementation of certain workforce reductions, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets. Such valuation allowance aggregated $150.3 million at June 30, 2015. We recognized an additional $8.7 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria during the second half of 2015, due to losses recognized by our German and Belgian operations during such period.\nWe record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more-likely-than-not our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. It is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made.\nIn addition, we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested (as that term is defined in GAAP). While we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances, such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. In such an event, we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental U.S. income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously-considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the U.S.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Contingencies - We record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. However, new information may become available or circumstances (such as applicable laws and regulations) may change, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters (and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults from operations is impacted by certain of these and other significant judgments and estimates, such as allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories, impairment of equity method investments and long-lived assets, defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals. In addition, net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals.\nComparison of 2015 to 2014 Results of Operations\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,651.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,156.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 operating statistics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage change in net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product pricing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 sales volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * Thousands of metric tons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry conditions and 2015 overview - Due to competitive pressures, our average TiO2 selling prices decreased throughout 2014 and 2015. Our average selling prices at the end of 2015 were 17% lower than at the end of 2014, with lower prices in all major markets, most notably in North American and certain export markets. Our average selling prices in 2015 were also impacted by a higher percentage of sales to lower-priced export markets in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced higher sales volumes in European and export markets in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower volumes in North American markets in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table shows our capacity utilization rates during 2014 and 2015.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur production capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a union labor lockout at our Canadian production facility that ended in December 2013, as restart of production at the facility did not begin until February 2014. Our production rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.\nWe continued to experience moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2014 and 2015. Given the time lag between when third-party feedstock ore is procured and when the TiO2 product produced with such ore is sold and recognized in our cost of sales, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold declined throughout 2014 and 2015. Consequently, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2015 was slightly lower than our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2014 (excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates).\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure. A portion of such expected cost savings are planned to occur through workforce reductions. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. We recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge in 2015 (substantially all of which was recognized in the second quarter) for such workforce reductions we had implemented through December 31, 2015, $10.8 million of which is classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. The charge associated with the workforce reductions implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, which impacted approximately 50 individuals, was not material due to the applicable law affecting such individuals, which generally provides for a short notice period (if any) and the payment of a nominal amount of severance (if any). See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet sales - Our net sales decreased 18% or $303.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the net effect of a 14% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $231 million) and a 6% increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately $99 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs.\nOur sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales in certain European and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in North American markets. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $138 million, or 8%, as compared to 2014.\nCost of sales - Cost of sales decreased $145.7 million or 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $26 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), a 3% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency\nfluctuations (primarily the euro). In addition, cost of sales in 2015 includes approximately $10.8 million of severance costs related to the workforce reduction plan discussed above.\nOur cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 86% in 2015 compared to 79% in 2014, as the unfavorable impact of lower average selling prices and the workforce reduction charge more than offset the favorable effects of lower raw material costs and efficiencies related to higher production volumes, as discussed above.\nGross margin and income (loss) from operations - Income from operations decreased by $150.8 million, from income of $149.7 million in 2014 to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in 2015. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to (1)% in 2015 from 9% in 2014. This decrease was driven by the decline in gross margin, which decreased to 14% in 2015 compared to 21% in 2014, as well as the negative impact of the workforce reduction charge classified as part of other operating expense ($10.9 million). As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin decreased primarily due to the net effect of lower selling prices, workforce reduction costs classified as part of cost of sales ($10.8 million), lower manufacturing costs (primarily raw materials), higher production volumes, and higher sales volumes. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 13% and 12% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed above, the relative increase in 2015 is primarily due to the workforce reduction charge classified as part of selling, general and administrative expense ($10.9 million).\nOther non-operating income (expense) - We recognized a $12.0 million pre-tax impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 due to other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in a marketable equity security available for sale. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $1.5 million from $17.0 million in 2014 to $18.5 million in 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels mostly offset by lower average interest rates in 2015. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense - We recognized income tax expense of $142.8 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $34.5 million in 2014. As discussed above in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d subsection, our income tax expense in 2015 includes an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax expense of $159.0 million related to the recognition of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance for our German and Belgian operations (mostly recognized in the second quarter). We continue to believe we will ultimately realize the full benefit of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards, in part because of their indefinite carryforward period. However, our ability to reverse all or a portion of such valuation allowance in the future is dependent on the presence of sufficient positive evidence, such as the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters, and the ability to demonstrate future profitability for a sustainable period. Until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate additional losses in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such losses would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax benefit, as such losses would result in a further increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. Alternatively, until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate income in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would also be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such income would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax expense, as we would reverse a portion of the valuation allowance to offset the income tax expense attributable to such income. In addition, any change in tax law related to the indefinite carryforward period of these NOLs could adversely impact our ability to reverse the valuation allowance in full. Consistent with our expectation regarding our consolidated results of operations in 2016 (as discussed below under the Outlook\u201d subsection), we currently believe it is likely our German and Belgian operations will report improved operating results in 2016 as compared to 2015. However, we currently do not expect that our German and Belgian operating results would improve to such an extent in 2016 that reversal of the valuation allowance in full would be supported by the presence of sufficient positive evidence.\nIn 2014, our income tax expense was favorably impacted by an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-U.S. operations are generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our U.S. operations. Excluding the impact of the net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2014, our effective tax rate in such period was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to our non-U.S. earnings. Our effective income tax rate in 2015, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a current U.S. income tax benefit attributable to current year losses of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision.\nComparison of 2014 to 2013 Results of Operations\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,732.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,651.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,620.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (132.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 operating statistics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage change in net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product pricing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 sales volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * Thousands of metric tons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales - Our net sales decreased 5% or $80.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due a 6% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $104 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs.\nOur sales volumes in 2014 remained relatively stable compared to 2013 as slightly higher sales in Europe were offset by lower sales in certain export markets. In addition, we estimate the favorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates increased our net sales by approximately $12 million, or 1%, as compared to 2013.\nCost of sales - Cost of sales decreased $318.0 million or 20% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $250 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), an 8% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency fluctuations (primarily the euro). Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79% in 2014 compared to 94% in 2013, primarily due to the net effects of lower raw material and other production costs and the lower average TiO2 selling prices discussed above. In addition, cost of sales in 2013 includes approximately $19 million of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs associated with the lockout at the Canadian TiO2 production facility and approximately $9 million of one-time costs resulting from the terms of the new collective\nbargaining agreement for our Canadian workforce, each of which were charged directly to cost of sales as discussed below.\nUnionized employees in our Canadian TiO2 production facility were covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired June 15, 2013. The Canadian facility represents approximately 19% of our worldwide TiO2 production capacity. The union employees represented by the Confederation des Syndicat National (CSN) rejected our revised global offer, and we declared a lockout of unionized employees upon the expiration of the existing contract. Effective the end of November 2013, a new collective bargaining agreement was reached with CSN and production at the facility resumed in February 2014. During the lockout we operated our Canadian plant at approximately 15% of the plant's capacity with non-union management employees. The reduction in our TiO2 production volumes at our Canadian facility resulted in approximately $19 million of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs that were charged directly to cost of sales. In addition, we recognized approximately $9 million in expenses associated with reaching a new collective bargaining agreement, consisting of a net $7 million non-cash charge due to the curtailment of one of our Canadian defined benefit pension plans and our Canadian other postretirement benefit plan and approximately $2 million of severance and other back-to-work expenses.\nOther operating expense, net - Other operating expense in 2013 includes a previously-reported third quarter litigation settlement charge of $35 million.\nGross margin and income (loss) from operations - Income from operations increased by $282.3 million from a loss of $132.6 million in 2013 to income of $149.7 in 2014. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 9% in 2014 from (8)% in 2013. This increase was driven by the improvement in gross margin, which increased to 21% in 2014 compared to 6% in 2013 and by the 2013 litigation settlement charge as discussed above. As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin increased primarily due to the net effect of lower manufacturing costs (primarily raw materials), lower selling prices, higher production volumes and 2013 costs associated with reaching a new Canadian collective bargaining agreement and related unabsorbed fixed costs charged directly to cost of sales. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates have positively affected our gross margin and income from operations. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $42 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately 12% and 11% for 2014 and 2013 respectively.\nOther non-operating income (expense) - In 2013, we recognized an aggregate $8.9 million pre-tax charge, consisting of the write-off of unamortized original issue discount costs and deferred financing costs related to the voluntary prepayment of our prior term loan by $290 million in the first quarter of 2013 and the remaining $100 million in the third quarter of 2013. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense decreased $2.6 million from $19.6 million in 2013 to $17.0 million in 2014 primarily due to lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings in 2014 partially offset by higher average debt levels. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - We recognized income tax expense of $34.5 million in 2014 compared to an income tax benefit of $57.9 million in 2013. This difference is primarily due to our increased earnings in 2014. In addition, our income tax expense in 2014 was favorably impacted by an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision.\nEffects of currency exchange rates\nWe have substantial operations and assets located outside the United States (primarily in Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada). The majority of our sales from non-U.S. operations are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, other major European currencies and the Canadian dollar. A portion of our sales generated from our non-U.S. operations is denominated in the U.S. dollar (and consequently our non-\nU.S. operations will generally hold U.S. dollars from time to time). Certain raw materials used worldwide, primarily titanium-containing feedstocks, are purchased primarily in U.S. dollars, while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies. Consequently, the translated U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period-to-period operating results. In addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time, our non-U.S. operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to (i) the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non-local currency sales or operating costs (primarily U.S. dollar denominated) are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non-local currency, (ii) changes in currency exchange rates during time periods when our non-U.S. operations are holding non-local currency (primarily U.S. dollars), and (iii) relative changes in the aggregate fair value of currency forward contracts held from time to time. As discussed in Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a portion of our currency exchange risk, and relative changes in the aggregate fair value of any currency forward contracts we hold from time to time serves in part to mitigate the currency transaction gains or losses we would otherwise recognize from the first two items described above.\nOverall, we estimate that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income from operations for the periods indicated.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> Impact of changes in currency exchange rates - 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> gain/loss-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Transaction gains/(losses) recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> impact of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $138 million reduction in net sales (translation loss) was caused primarily by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, as our euro-denominated sales were translated into fewer U.S. dollars in 2015 as compared to 2014. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone in 2015 did not have a significant effect on the reported amount of our net sales, as a substantial portion of the sales generated by our Canadian and Norwegian operations are denominated in the U.S. dollar.\nThe $40 million increase in income from operations comprised the following net effects:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> A reduction in the amount of net currency transaction gains during the two periods of approximately $4 million.

We expect our production volumes to be higher in 2016 as compared to 2015, as our production rates in 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances. Assuming economic conditions do not deteriorate in the various regions of the world, we expect our sales volumes to be higher in 2016 as compared to 2015. We will continue to monitor current and anticipated near-term customer demand levels and align our production and inventories accordingly.\nWe continued to experience moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2014 and 2015. Given the time lag between when third-party feedstock ore is procured and when the TiO2 product produced with such ore is sold and recognized in our cost of sales, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2015 was slightly lower than our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2014 (excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates). We expect our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2016 will be lower than our per-metric ton cost in 2015, due in part to the favorable effect of the workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives we are undertaking as well as some modest improvement in the cost of feedstock ore.\nWe started 2015 with selling prices 9% lower than the beginning of 2014, and prices declined by an additional 17% during 2015. Industry data indicates that overall TiO2 inventory held by producers has declined significantly during 2015. In addition, we believe most customers hold very low inventories of TiO2 with many\noperating on a just-in-time basis. With the improvement in sales volumes experienced in 2015, we continue to see evidence of strengthening demand for our TiO2 products in certain of our primary markets. We and our major competitors announced a price increase in late 2015, which is expected to be implemented in the first quarter of 2016, or as contracts allow. The extent to which we will be able to achieve any price increases in the near term will depend on market conditions.\nWe initiated a restructuring plan in 2015 designed to improve our long-term cost structure. A portion of such expected cost savings is planned to occur through workforce reductions. During 2015, we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. As of December 31, 2015 we have recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge for such workforce reductions we had implemented through that date, $10.8 million of which is classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. The workforce reductions we have implemented through December 31, 2015 are not expected to negatively impact our ability to operate our production facilities at their practical capacity rates.\nIn addition to the workforce reductions implemented through December 31, 2015, we are also in the process of implementing other cost reduction initiatives throughout the organization, including the implementation of continued process productivity improvements. The workforce reductions we have implemented through December 31, 2015, combined with certain open positions that are not expected to be filled and cost savings expected to be realized from our other cost reduction initiatives we are undertaking, are expected to result in a payback of the aggregate workforce reduction charge accrued at December 31, 2015 within approximately one year, the benefit of which we began to recognize in the second half of 2015.\nOverall, we expect income from operations in 2016 will be higher as compared to 2015 as a result of:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the favorable effects of anticipated higher sales and production volumes in 2015,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the favorable effect of lower-cost feedstock ore, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the expected cost savings from workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives throughout the organization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHowever, given, among other things, the level of our average selling prices at the beginning of 2016, we believe it is possible we would report a loss from operations in the first quarter of 2016.\nDue to the constraints of high capital costs and extended lead time associated with adding significant new TiO2 production capacity, especially for premium grades of TiO2 products produced from the chloride process, we believe increased and sustained profit margins will be necessary to financially justify major expansions of TiO2 production capacity required to meet expected future growth in demand. As a result of customer decisions over the last year and the resulting adverse effect on global TiO2 pricing, some industry projects to increase TiO2 production capacity have been cancelled or deferred indefinitely, and announcements have been made regarding the closure of certain facilities. Given the lead time required for production capacity expansions, a shortage of TiO2 products could occur if economic conditions improve and global demand levels for TiO2 increase sufficiently.\nOur expectations for our future operating results are based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including worldwide growth of gross domestic product, competition in the marketplace, continued operation of competitors, unexpected or earlier-than-expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances. If actual developments differ from our expectations, our results of operations could be unfavorably affected.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nConsolidated cash flows\nOperating activities\nTrends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities (excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities) are generally similar to trends in our earnings. In addition to the impact of the operating, investing and financing cash flows discussed below, changes in the amount of cash and cash equivalents we report from year to year can be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates, since a portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. For example, during 2015, relative changes in currency exchange rates resulted in an $8.4 million decrease in the reported amount of our cash and cash equivalents compared to $9.4 million decrease in 2014 and a $1.2 million increase in 2013.\nCash provided by operating activities was $52.1 million in 2015 compared to $87.7 million in 2014. This $35.6 million decrease was primarily due to the net effects of the following:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> lower income from operations in 2015 of $150.8 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> lower cash used in 2015 of $122.6 million associated with relative changes in our inventories, receivables, prepaids, payables and accruals,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> lower net cash paid for income taxes in 2015 of $16.1 million due to decreased profits,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> lower net distributions from our TiO2 joint venture in 2015 of $4.1 million, primarily due to the timing of the joint venture's working capital needs, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> higher cash paid for interest in 2015 of $1.9 million, primarily due to higher average debt levels mostly offset by lower average interest rates on borrowings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities was $87.7 million in 2014 compared to $130.4 million in 2013.

Capital expenditures are primarily incurred to maintain and improve the cost effectiveness of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, approximately $5 million of our 2015 capital expenditure relates to the implementation of a new accounting and manufacturing system. Our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately $44.0 million (including $6.9 million in 2015) for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs. We had a net reduction in restricted cash of $7.2 million in 2014, principally related to the release of certain restricted cash deposits upon the cancellation of certain letters of credit issued in connection with the appeal of a Canadian income tax assessment which was completed in our favor. See Notes 9 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing activities\nDuring 2015, we paid quarterly dividends aggregating $.60 per share ($69.5 million).\nDuring 2014, we:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $348.3 million on our new term loan and subsequently repaid $2.6 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> repaid $170.0 million under our note payable with Contran,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $81.0 million on our revolving North American credit facility and subsequently repaid $92.1 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $1.1 million from a Canadian economic development agency, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> paid quarterly dividends to stockholders aggregating $.60 per share ($69.5 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2013, we:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> voluntarily prepaid $390.0 million principal amount on our prior term loan,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $190.0 million and subsequently repaid $20 million on our note payable with Contran entered into in February 2013,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $162.1 million and subsequently repaid $151.0 million on our revolving North American credit facility,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed \u20ac10 million ($12.8 million when borrowed) on our European credit facility and subsequently repaid an aggregate \u20ac20 million ($26.5 million when repaid),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowed $1.7 million from a Canadian economic development agency,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> purchased 49,000 shares of our common stock in open market transactions for $.7 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> paid quarterly dividends to stockholders aggregating $.60 per share ($69.5 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2016, our board of directors declared a first quarter 2016 regular quarterly dividend of $.15 per share, payable March 17, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2016.\nOutstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability\nAt December 31, 2015, our consolidated debt comprised:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> $343.9 million aggregate borrowing under our term loan ($338.0 million carrying amount, net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs) due in February 2020, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> approximately $3.0 million of other indebtedness.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur North American and European revolvers and our term loan contain a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer substantially all of our assets to, another entity, and contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type. Certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with typical financial or payment covenants. For example, certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control (as defined in the agreement) of the borrower. In addition, certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business. Our European revolving credit facility also requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios, and one of such requirements is based on the ratio of net debt to the last twelve months EBITDA of the borrowers. The terms of all of our debt instruments (including revolving lines of credit for which we have no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015) are discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at December 31, 2015. We believe that we will be able to continue to comply with the financial covenants contained in our credit facilities through their maturity.\nIn addition to the outstanding indebtedness indicated above, at December 31, 2015 we had $68.3 million available for borrowing under our North American revolving credit facility, and we could borrow all such available amount without violating any of the facility's covenants. At December 31, 2015, based upon the last twelve months EBITDA and the net debt to EBITDA financial test for our European revolving credit facility, our borrowing availability under such facility is approximately 19% of the credit facility, or \u20ac23.1 million ($25.3 million).\nOur assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries, and our ability to service parent-level obligations depends in part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise. Our term loan is collateralized, by, among other things, a first priority lien on (i) 100% of the common stock of certain of our U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries, (ii) 65% of the common stock or other ownership interest of our Canadian subsidiary (Kronos Canada, Inc.) and certain first-tier European subsidiaries (Kronos Titan GmbH and Kronos Denmark ApS) and (iii) a $395.7 million unsecured promissory note issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos International, Inc. (KII). The term loan is also collateralized by a second priority lien on our U.S. assets which collateralize our North American revolving facility. Our North American revolving credit facility is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on the borrower's trade receivables and inventories. Our European revolving credit facility is collateralized by, among other things, the accounts receivable and inventories of the borrowers plus a limited pledge of all the other assets of the Belgian borrower. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity\nOur primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to (i) fund working capital expenditures, (ii) repay any short-term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and (iii) provide for the payment of dividends. From time-to-time we will incur indebtedness, generally to (i) fund short-term working capital needs, (ii) refinance existing indebtedness or (iii) fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business. We will also from time-to-time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business and use the proceeds to (i) repay existing indebtedness, (ii) make investments in marketable and other securities, (iii) fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or (iv) pay dividends.\nThe TiO2 industry is cyclical, and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows. Changes in TiO2 pricing, production volumes and customer demand, among other things, could significantly affect our liquidity.\nWe routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements, alternative uses of capital, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our dividend policy, our debt service, our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows. As a result of this process, we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce, refinance, repurchase or restructure indebtedness, raise additional capital, repurchase shares of our common stock, modify our dividend policy, restructure ownership interests, sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets, or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital\nresources. Such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies. In the normal course of our business, we may investigate, evaluate, discuss and engage in acquisition, joint venture, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the TiO2 industry. In the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness.\nBased upon our expectation for the TiO2 industry and anticipated demands on cash resources, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term obligations (defined as the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2016) and our long-term obligations (defined as the five-year period ending December 31, 2020, our time period for long-term budgeting). If actual developments differ from our expectations, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities\nAt December 31, 2015 we had:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Held by\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\nentities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-U.S.\nentities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncurrent marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock repurchase program\nAt December 31, 2015, we have 1,951,000 shares available for repurchase under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures\nWe intend to spend approximately $63 million primarily to maintain and improve our existing facilities during 2016, including approximately $9 million in the area of environmental compliance, protection and improvement. The majority of our expenditures in 2016 will be to maintain and improve the cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, a significant portion of planned capital expenditures in 2016 relates to the implementation of a new accounting and manufacturing system. Our capital expenditures in the area of environmental compliance, protection and improvement include expenditures which are primarily focused on increased operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection, such as lower emissions from our manufacturing plants. Capital spending for 2016 is expected to be funded through cash on hand or borrowing under existing credit facilities.\nOff-balance sheet financing\nOther than operating lease commitments disclosed in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are not party to any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nRelated party transactions\nWe are party to certain transactions with related parties. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. It is our policy to engage in transactions with related parties on terms, in our opinion, no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unrelated parties.\nCommitments and contingencies\nSee Notes 10 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain income tax examinations currently underway, certain legal proceedings and other commitments.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt and other contractual commitments\nAs more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are a party to various debt, lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future. See Notes 9, 14, 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing and amount shown for our commitments in the table below are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments.

In 2015, the company reported a net loss of $173.6 million compared to a net income of $99.2 million in 2014. This was primarily due to lower income from operations, recognition of non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge on an investment, and workforce reduction costs. Additionally, industry conditions, impact of currency exchange rates, and changes in average TiO2 selling prices affected the company's results.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nWe are a leading global producer and marketer of value-added TiO2. TiO2 is used for a variety of manufacturing applications, including plastics, paints, paper and other industrial products. During 2015, approximately one-half of our sales volumes were sold into European markets. We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with an estimated 18% share of European TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. In addition, we estimate we have a 15% share of North American TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. Our production facilities are located throughout Europe and North America.\nWe consider TiO2 to be a quality of life\u201d product, with demand affected by gross domestic product, or GDP, and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world. Over the long-term, we expect demand for TiO2 will grow by 2% to 3% per year, consistent with our expectations for the long-term growth in GDP. However, even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market, demand for TiO2 in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in GDP, in part due to relative changes in the TiO2 inventory levels of our customers. We believe that our customers' inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market TiO2 selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product. Although certain of our TiO2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service.\nThe factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are:\n \u00b7 Our TiO2 sales and production volumes, \n \u00b7 TiO2 selling prices, \n \u00b7 Manufacturing costs, particularly raw materials such as third-party feedstock ore, maintenance and energy-related expenses, and \n \u00b7 Currency exchange rates (particularly the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar). \nOur key performance indicators are our TiO2 average selling prices, our level of TiO2 sales and production volumes and the cost of our third-party feedstock ore. TiO2 selling prices generally follow industry trends and the selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures.\nIn addition, our effective income tax rate in both 2014 and 2015 was impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below.\nExecutive summary\nWe reported a net loss of $173.6 million, or $1.50 per share for 2015 compared to net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014. We reported a net loss in 2015 primarily due to lower income from operations, the recognition of an aggregate $159.0 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations, the recognition of an aggregate $12.0 million pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charge on our investment in a marketable equity security, and a $21.7 million charge associated with the implementation of certain workforce reductions. Comparability of our results was also impacted by lower average selling prices in 2015, partially offset by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and other production costs (primarily raw materials) and the net effect of changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe reported net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014 compared to a net loss of $102.0 million, or $.88 per share for 2013. We reported net income in 2014 compared to a loss in 2013 principally due to improved results from operations primarily resulting from lower raw material costs and higher production volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices in 2014 as well as a 2013 litigation settlement charge and unabsorbed fixed production and other costs associated with the labor lockout at our Canadian plant as further discussed below.\nOur net loss in 2015 includes:\n \u00b7 the recognition of an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations of $159.0 million ($1.37 per share), mostly recognized in the second quarter, \n \u00b7 the third quarter recognition of an aggregate pre-tax OTTI loss on our investment in a marketable equity security of $12.0 million ($7.8 million, or $.07 per share, net of income tax benefit), and \n \u00b7 a pre-tax charge of $21.7 million ($18.5 million, or $.16 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to workforce reduction costs, mostly recognized in the second quarter. \nOur net income in 2014 includes an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million ($.04 per share) related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions (mostly in the second quarter).\nOur net loss in 2013 includes:\n \u00b7 a pre-tax litigation settlement charge of $35 million ($22.5 million, or $.19 per share, net of income tax benefit), \n \u00b7 approximately $28 million aggregate costs ($21 million, or $.18 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to unabsorbed fixed production and other costs as a result of the Canadian plant lockout, and costs associated with the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement reached with our Canadian workforce, and \n \u00b7 an aggregate charge of $8.9 million ($5.8 million, or $.05 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to the voluntary prepayment of $390 million principal amount of our term loan, consisting of the write-off of original issue discount costs and deferred financing costs. \nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto, the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation, income tax and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ significantly from previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n \u00b7 Long-lived assets - We recognize an impairment charge associated with our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever we determine that recovery of such long-lived asset is not probable. Such determination is made in accordance with the applicable GAAP requirements of Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 360-10-35 Property, Plant and Equipment and is based upon, among other things, estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset. Significant judgment is \n required in estimating such cash flows. Adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future. We do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in ASC Topic 360-10-35 are present. We did not evaluate any long-lived assets for impairment during 2015 because no such impairment indicators were present. \n \u00b7 Benefit plans - We maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions, or OPEB, plans. The amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and OPEB expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and OPEB costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions, including discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected health care trend rates and expected mortality. Variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases, as applicable, in the recognized pension and OPEB obligations, pension and OPEB expenses and funding requirements. These assumptions are more fully described below under Defined Benefit Pension Plans\u201d and OPEB Plans.\u201d \n \u00b7 Income taxes - We recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying jurisdiction in which we operate are netted and presented as either a noncurrent deferred income tax asset or liability, as applicable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more-likely-than-not be realized in the future, resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made. \nFor example, at December 31, 2015 we have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $683 million for German corporate purposes and $96 million for German trade tax purposes) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $86 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the U.S. federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the U.S. state income tax.\nPrior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expect to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, which as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report have been driven in large part by the trend in our average TiO2 selling prices over such periods as well as the $21.1 million pre-tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the implementation of certain workforce reductions, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets. Such valuation allowance aggregated $150.3 million at June 30, 2015. We recognized an additional $8.7 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria during the second half of 2015, due to losses recognized by our German and Belgian operations during such period.\nWe record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more-likely-than-not our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. It is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made.\nIn addition, we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested (as that term is defined in GAAP). While we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances, such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. In such an event, we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental U.S. income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously-considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the U.S.\n \u00b7 Contingencies - We record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. However, new information may become available or circumstances (such as applicable laws and regulations) may change, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters (and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change). \nResults from operations is impacted by certain of these and other significant judgments and estimates, such as allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories, impairment of equity method investments and long-lived assets, defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals. In addition, net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals.\nComparison of 2015 to 2014 Results of Operations\n\nIndustry conditions and 2015 overview - Due to competitive pressures, our average TiO2 selling prices decreased throughout 2014 and 2015. Our average selling prices at the end of 2015 were 17% lower than at the end of 2014, with lower prices in all major markets, most notably in North American and certain export markets. Our average selling prices in 2015 were also impacted by a higher percentage of sales to lower-priced export markets in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced higher sales volumes in European and export markets in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower volumes in North American markets in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table shows our capacity utilization rates during 2014 and 2015.\n\nOur production capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a union labor lockout at our Canadian production facility that ended in December 2013, as restart of production at the facility did not begin until February 2014. Our production rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.\nWe continued to experience moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2014 and 2015. Given the time lag between when third-party feedstock ore is procured and when the TiO2 product produced with such ore is sold and recognized in our cost of sales, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold declined throughout 2014 and 2015. Consequently, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2015 was slightly lower than our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2014 (excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates).\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure. A portion of such expected cost savings are planned to occur through workforce reductions. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. We recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge in 2015 (substantially all of which was recognized in the second quarter) for such workforce reductions we had implemented through December 31, 2015, $10.8 million of which is classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. The charge associated with the workforce reductions implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, which impacted approximately 50 individuals, was not material due to the applicable law affecting such individuals, which generally provides for a short notice period (if any) and the payment of a nominal amount of severance (if any). See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet sales - Our net sales decreased 18% or $303.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the net effect of a 14% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $231 million) and a 6% increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately $99 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs.\nOur sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales in certain European and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in North American markets. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $138 million, or 8%, as compared to 2014.\nCost of sales - Cost of sales decreased $145.7 million or 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $26 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), a 3% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency\nfluctuations (primarily the euro). In addition, cost of sales in 2015 includes approximately $10.8 million of severance costs related to the workforce reduction plan discussed above.\nOur cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 86% in 2015 compared to 79% in 2014, as the unfavorable impact of lower average selling prices and the workforce reduction charge more than offset the favorable effects of lower raw material costs and efficiencies related to higher production volumes, as discussed above.\nGross margin and income (loss) from operations - Income from operations decreased by $150.8 million, from income of $149.7 million in 2014 to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in 2015. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to (1)% in 2015 from 9% in 2014. This decrease was driven by the decline in gross margin, which decreased to 14% in 2015 compared to 21% in 2014, as well as the negative impact of the workforce reduction charge classified as part of other operating expense ($10.9 million). As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin decreased primarily due to the net effect of lower selling prices, workforce reduction costs classified as part of cost of sales ($10.8 million), lower manufacturing costs (primarily raw materials), higher production volumes, and higher sales volumes. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 13% and 12% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed above, the relative increase in 2015 is primarily due to the workforce reduction charge classified as part of selling, general and administrative expense ($10.9 million).\nOther non-operating income (expense) - We recognized a $12.0 million pre-tax impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 due to other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in a marketable equity security available for sale. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $1.5 million from $17.0 million in 2014 to $18.5 million in 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels mostly offset by lower average interest rates in 2015. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense - We recognized income tax expense of $142.8 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $34.5 million in 2014. As discussed above in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d subsection, our income tax expense in 2015 includes an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax expense of $159.0 million related to the recognition of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance for our German and Belgian operations (mostly recognized in the second quarter). We continue to believe we will ultimately realize the full benefit of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards, in part because of their indefinite carryforward period. However, our ability to reverse all or a portion of such valuation allowance in the future is dependent on the presence of sufficient positive evidence, such as the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters, and the ability to demonstrate future profitability for a sustainable period. Until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate additional losses in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such losses would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax benefit, as such losses would result in a further increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. Alternatively, until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate income in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would also be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such income would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax expense, as we would reverse a portion of the valuation allowance to offset the income tax expense attributable to such income. In addition, any change in tax law related to the indefinite carryforward period of these NOLs could adversely impact our ability to reverse the valuation allowance in full. Consistent with our expectation regarding our consolidated results of operations in 2016 (as discussed below under the Outlook\u201d subsection), we currently believe it is likely our German and Belgian operations will report improved operating results in 2016 as compared to 2015. However, we currently do not expect that our German and Belgian operating results would improve to such an extent in 2016 that reversal of the valuation allowance in full would be supported by the presence of sufficient positive evidence.\nIn 2014, our income tax expense was favorably impacted by an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-U.S. operations are generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our U.S. operations. Excluding the impact of the net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2014, our effective tax rate in such period was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to our non-U.S. earnings. Our effective income tax rate in 2015, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a current U.S. income tax benefit attributable to current year losses of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision.\nComparison of 2014 to 2013 Results of Operations\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,732.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,651.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,620.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (132.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 operating statistics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage change in net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product pricing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 sales volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nWe are a leading global producer and marketer of value-added TiO2. TiO2 is used for a variety of manufacturing applications, including plastics, paints, paper and other industrial products. During 2015, approximately one-half of our sales volumes were sold into European markets. We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with an estimated 18% share of European TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. In addition, we estimate we have a 15% share of North American TiO2 sales volumes in 2015. Our production facilities are located throughout Europe and North America.\nWe consider TiO2 to be a quality of life\u201d product, with demand affected by gross domestic product, or GDP, and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world. Over the long-term, we expect demand for TiO2 will grow by 2% to 3% per year, consistent with our expectations for the long-term growth in GDP. However, even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market, demand for TiO2 in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in GDP, in part due to relative changes in the TiO2 inventory levels of our customers. We believe that our customers' inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market TiO2 selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product. Although certain of our TiO2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service.\nThe factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are:\n \u00b7 Our TiO2 sales and production volumes, \n \u00b7 TiO2 selling prices, \n \u00b7 Manufacturing costs, particularly raw materials such as third-party feedstock ore, maintenance and energy-related expenses, and \n \u00b7 Currency exchange rates (particularly the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar). \nOur key performance indicators are our TiO2 average selling prices, our level of TiO2 sales and production volumes and the cost of our third-party feedstock ore. TiO2 selling prices generally follow industry trends and the selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures.\nIn addition, our effective income tax rate in both 2014 and 2015 was impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below.\nExecutive summary\nWe reported a net loss of $173.6 million, or $1.50 per share for 2015 compared to net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014. We reported a net loss in 2015 primarily due to lower income from operations, the recognition of an aggregate $159.0 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations, the recognition of an aggregate $12.0 million pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charge on our investment in a marketable equity security, and a $21.7 million charge associated with the implementation of certain workforce reductions. Comparability of our results was also impacted by lower average selling prices in 2015, partially offset by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and other production costs (primarily raw materials) and the net effect of changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe reported net income of $99.2 million, or $.86 per share for 2014 compared to a net loss of $102.0 million, or $.88 per share for 2013. We reported net income in 2014 compared to a loss in 2013 principally due to improved results from operations primarily resulting from lower raw material costs and higher production volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices in 2014 as well as a 2013 litigation settlement charge and unabsorbed fixed production and other costs associated with the labor lockout at our Canadian plant as further discussed below.\nOur net loss in 2015 includes:\n \u00b7 the recognition of an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations of $159.0 million ($1.37 per share), mostly recognized in the second quarter, \n \u00b7 the third quarter recognition of an aggregate pre-tax OTTI loss on our investment in a marketable equity security of $12.0 million ($7.8 million, or $.07 per share, net of income tax benefit), and \n \u00b7 a pre-tax charge of $21.7 million ($18.5 million, or $.16 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to workforce reduction costs, mostly recognized in the second quarter. \nOur net income in 2014 includes an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million ($.04 per share) related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions (mostly in the second quarter).\nOur net loss in 2013 includes:\n \u00b7 a pre-tax litigation settlement charge of $35 million ($22.5 million, or $.19 per share, net of income tax benefit), \n \u00b7 approximately $28 million aggregate costs ($21 million, or $.18 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to unabsorbed fixed production and other costs as a result of the Canadian plant lockout, and costs associated with the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement reached with our Canadian workforce, and \n \u00b7 an aggregate charge of $8.9 million ($5.8 million, or $.05 per share, net of income tax benefit) related to the voluntary prepayment of $390 million principal amount of our term loan, consisting of the write-off of original issue discount costs and deferred financing costs. \nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto, the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation, income tax and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ significantly from previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n \u00b7 Long-lived assets - We recognize an impairment charge associated with our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever we determine that recovery of such long-lived asset is not probable. Such determination is made in accordance with the applicable GAAP requirements of Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 360-10-35 Property, Plant and Equipment and is based upon, among other things, estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset. Significant judgment is \n required in estimating such cash flows. Adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future. We do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in ASC Topic 360-10-35 are present. We did not evaluate any long-lived assets for impairment during 2015 because no such impairment indicators were present. \n \u00b7 Benefit plans - We maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions, or OPEB, plans. The amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and OPEB expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and OPEB costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions, including discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected health care trend rates and expected mortality. Variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases, as applicable, in the recognized pension and OPEB obligations, pension and OPEB expenses and funding requirements. These assumptions are more fully described below under Defined Benefit Pension Plans\u201d and OPEB Plans.\u201d \n \u00b7 Income taxes - We recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying jurisdiction in which we operate are netted and presented as either a noncurrent deferred income tax asset or liability, as applicable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more-likely-than-not be realized in the future, resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made. \nFor example, at December 31, 2015 we have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $683 million for German corporate purposes and $96 million for German trade tax purposes) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $86 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the U.S. federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the U.S. state income tax.\nPrior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expect to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, which as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report have been driven in large part by the trend in our average TiO2 selling prices over such periods as well as the $21.1 million pre-tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the implementation of certain workforce reductions, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets. Such valuation allowance aggregated $150.3 million at June 30, 2015. We recognized an additional $8.7 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria during the second half of 2015, due to losses recognized by our German and Belgian operations during such period.\nWe record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more-likely-than-not our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. It is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made.\nIn addition, we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested (as that term is defined in GAAP). While we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances, such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. In such an event, we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental U.S. income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously-considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the U.S.\n \u00b7 Contingencies - We record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. However, new information may become available or circumstances (such as applicable laws and regulations) may change, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters (and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change). \nResults from operations is impacted by certain of these and other significant judgments and estimates, such as allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories, impairment of equity method investments and long-lived assets, defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals. In addition, net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals.\nComparison of 2015 to 2014 Results of Operations\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,651.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,156.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 operating statistics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage change in net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product pricing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 sales volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * Thousands of metric tons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry conditions and 2015 overview - Due to competitive pressures, our average TiO2 selling prices decreased throughout 2014 and 2015. Our average selling prices at the end of 2015 were 17% lower than at the end of 2014, with lower prices in all major markets, most notably in North American and certain export markets. Our average selling prices in 2015 were also impacted by a higher percentage of sales to lower-priced export markets in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced higher sales volumes in European and export markets in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower volumes in North American markets in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table shows our capacity utilization rates during 2014 and 2015.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur production capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a union labor lockout at our Canadian production facility that ended in December 2013, as restart of production at the facility did not begin until February 2014. Our production rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.\nWe continued to experience moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2014 and 2015. Given the time lag between when third-party feedstock ore is procured and when the TiO2 product produced with such ore is sold and recognized in our cost of sales, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold declined throughout 2014 and 2015. Consequently, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2015 was slightly lower than our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2014 (excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates).\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure. A portion of such expected cost savings are planned to occur through workforce reductions. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. We recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge in 2015 (substantially all of which was recognized in the second quarter) for such workforce reductions we had implemented through December 31, 2015, $10.8 million of which is classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. The charge associated with the workforce reductions implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, which impacted approximately 50 individuals, was not material due to the applicable law affecting such individuals, which generally provides for a short notice period (if any) and the payment of a nominal amount of severance (if any). See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet sales - Our net sales decreased 18% or $303.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the net effect of a 14% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $231 million) and a 6% increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately $99 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs.\nOur sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales in certain European and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in North American markets. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $138 million, or 8%, as compared to 2014.\nCost of sales - Cost of sales decreased $145.7 million or 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $26 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), a 3% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency\nfluctuations (primarily the euro). In addition, cost of sales in 2015 includes approximately $10.8 million of severance costs related to the workforce reduction plan discussed above.\nOur cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 86% in 2015 compared to 79% in 2014, as the unfavorable impact of lower average selling prices and the workforce reduction charge more than offset the favorable effects of lower raw material costs and efficiencies related to higher production volumes, as discussed above.\nGross margin and income (loss) from operations - Income from operations decreased by $150.8 million, from income of $149.7 million in 2014 to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in 2015. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to (1)% in 2015 from 9% in 2014. This decrease was driven by the decline in gross margin, which decreased to 14% in 2015 compared to 21% in 2014, as well as the negative impact of the workforce reduction charge classified as part of other operating expense ($10.9 million). As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin decreased primarily due to the net effect of lower selling prices, workforce reduction costs classified as part of cost of sales ($10.8 million), lower manufacturing costs (primarily raw materials), higher production volumes, and higher sales volumes. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 13% and 12% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed above, the relative increase in 2015 is primarily due to the workforce reduction charge classified as part of selling, general and administrative expense ($10.9 million).\nOther non-operating income (expense) - We recognized a $12.0 million pre-tax impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 due to other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in a marketable equity security available for sale. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense increased $1.5 million from $17.0 million in 2014 to $18.5 million in 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels mostly offset by lower average interest rates in 2015. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense - We recognized income tax expense of $142.8 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $34.5 million in 2014. As discussed above in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d subsection, our income tax expense in 2015 includes an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax expense of $159.0 million related to the recognition of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance for our German and Belgian operations (mostly recognized in the second quarter). We continue to believe we will ultimately realize the full benefit of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards, in part because of their indefinite carryforward period. However, our ability to reverse all or a portion of such valuation allowance in the future is dependent on the presence of sufficient positive evidence, such as the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters, and the ability to demonstrate future profitability for a sustainable period. Until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate additional losses in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such losses would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax benefit, as such losses would result in a further increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. Alternatively, until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance in full, to the extent we generate income in Germany or Belgium in the intervening periods, our effective income tax rate would also be impacted by the existence of such valuation allowance, because such income would effectively be recognized without any associated net income tax expense, as we would reverse a portion of the valuation allowance to offset the income tax expense attributable to such income. In addition, any change in tax law related to the indefinite carryforward period of these NOLs could adversely impact our ability to reverse the valuation allowance in full. Consistent with our expectation regarding our consolidated results of operations in 2016 (as discussed below under the Outlook\u201d subsection), we currently believe it is likely our German and Belgian operations will report improved operating results in 2016 as compared to 2015. However, we currently do not expect that our German and Belgian operating results would improve to such an extent in 2016 that reversal of the valuation allowance in full would be supported by the presence of sufficient positive evidence.\nIn 2014, our income tax expense was favorably impacted by an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-U.S. operations are generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our U.S. operations. Excluding the impact of the net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2014, our effective tax rate in such period was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to our non-U.S. earnings. Our effective income tax rate in 2015, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a current U.S. income tax benefit attributable to current year losses of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision.\nComparison of 2014 to 2013 Results of Operations\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,732.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,651.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,620.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (132.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 operating statistics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production volumes*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage change in net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product pricing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 sales volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TiO2 product mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
