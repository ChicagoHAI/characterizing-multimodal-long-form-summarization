Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of 26 premium hotels and resorts that contain 9,472 guest rooms located in 17 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Occupancy percentage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average Daily Rate (or ADR);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 73% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOverview of 2016\nDuring 2016, we executed on our asset management initiatives to improve our portfolio's operating results. We improved our portfolio quality and lowered our financial leverage through the disposition of three non-core hotels and improved our financial flexibility through increasing and extending our corporate credit facility and entering into a new unsecured term loan. Key highlights for 2016 include the following:\nMortgage Loan Repayments. On January 11, 2016, we repaid the $201.7 million mortgage loan secured by the Chicago Marriott Downtown. On May 11, 2016, we repaid the $48.1 million mortgage loan secured by the Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue.\nAmended Credit Facility and New Term Loan. During 2016, we amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facility to increase the capacity to $300 million, decrease the pricing and extend the maturity date to May 2020. We also closed on a new five-year $100 million senior unsecured term loan in 2016.\nHotel Dispositions. In June 2016, we sold the 485-room Orlando Airport Marriott for a contractual sales price of $63 million and the 821-room Hilton Minneapolis for a contractual sales price of $140 million. In July 2016, we sold the 169-room Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City for a contractual sales price of $65 million.\nShare Repurchases. We repurchased 728,237 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.92 per share for a total purchase price of $6.5 million during the second half of 2016.\nOutlook for 2017\nWe believe the economic growth outlook for 2017 has recently improved modestly based on the potential for national tax reform, deregulation, and other economic stimulus. We believe that this improved economic growth outlook will support lodging fundamentals. Unemployment continues to remain low and consumer confidence has increased in recent months.\nWe expect 2017 will be the U.S. lodging industry's eighth year of consecutive growth, albeit moderate growth. Supply increases, particularly in urban markets, will likely hamper rate growth. Our portfolio is weighted towards urban markets, specifically New York City and Chicago, which are two markets with recent and expected supply increases in excess of national averages.\nWe enter 2017 with several favorable factors, including: (1) ownership of a high-quality portfolio concentrated in urban and resort locations; (2) increased internal growth from the continuation of our asset management initiatives and recent hotel renovations; (3) low leveraged capital structure and only one near-term debt maturity; and (4) an unrestricted cash balance of $243 million and no outstanding borrowings on our $300 million senior unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information for the year ended December 31, 2016 for each of the hotels we owned during 2016.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nRooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ADR($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RevPAR($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\nfrom 2015\nRevPAR (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chicago Marriott\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Chicago, Illinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hilton Minneapolis (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minneapolis, Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Boston, Massachusetts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lexington Hotel New York\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York, New York\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Salt Lake City, Utah\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renaissance Worthington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Worth, Texas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Frenchman's Reef & Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orlando Airport Marriott (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Orlando, Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin San Diego\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>San Diego, California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Washington, D.C.

The operating expenses consisted of the following (in millions):\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rooms departmental expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and beverage departmental expenses\n</td> <td>125.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other departmental expenses\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilities\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repairs and maintenance\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise fees\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fees\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive management fees\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property taxes\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other fixed charges\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel pre-opening and transition costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground rent-Contractual\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground rent-Non-cash\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total hotel operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>618.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>649.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur hotel operating expenses decreased $31.1 million from $649.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $618.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in hotel operating expenses includes amounts that are not comparable quarter-over-quarter as follows:\n\u2022$1.0 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$5.5 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\n\u2022$10.5 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016.\n\u2022$21.2 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016.\n\u2022$4.5 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016.\nExcluding the non-comparable amounts, hotel operating expenses decreased $1.4 million, or 0.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. Other departmental expenses decreased primarily due to reclassifications of certain expenses in 2016 to comply with the 11th Edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our 2016 hotel dispositions, partially offset by increased depreciation from our recent hotel renovations.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel. We did not recognize any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We had no hotel acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.5 million, from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and the reversal of $0.7 million of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of equity awards related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, partially offset by an increase in other employee compensation and audit fees in 2016.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense was $41.7 million and $52.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is comprised of the following (in millions):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan interest\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility interest and unused fees\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premium\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate cap fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is related to the refinancing of a portion of our total debt at lower interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate for our debt decreased from 4.5% as of December 31, 2015 to 3.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nGain on repayments of notes receivable. In November 2015, we received $3.9 million for the repayment of the fully reserved loan we provided to the buyer of the Oak Brook Hills Resort upon sale of the hotel in 2014. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a gain of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $12.4 million in 2016 and $11.6 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax expense includes $12.4 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.4 million pre-tax income of our TRS. There was no foreign income tax expense incurred on the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef. The 2015 income tax expense includes $11.3 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.1 million pre-tax income of our TRS, $0.3 million of foreign income tax expense incurred on the $7.2 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue.

Franchise fees increased $6.7 million, or 43.8%, primarily due to the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, higher franchise fees at the Lexington Hotel New York and the acquisitions of the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort and Sheraton Suites Key West. Property taxes increased $7.1 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to property tax reassessments at our properties, particularly our Chicago hotels, as well as newly acquired hotels. Incentive management fees decreased $1.1 million, or 12.9%, primarily due to an amendment to the management agreement at the Chicago Marriott Downtown, which reduced management fees beginning in April 2015. Hotel pre-opening and transition costs increased $0.7 million, or 70%, primarily due to the rebranding of the hotel formerly known as the Conrad Chicago to The Gwen, a Luxury Collection Hotel, in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to depreciation on capital expenditures from our recent hotel renovations, partially offset by an increase in fully depreciated furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We incurred $2.1 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with the acquisitions of the Inn at Key West, Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central and Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses increased $1.8 million year over year. The increase is due primarily to the reimbursement of $1.8 million of previously incurred legal and other costs from the proceeds of the Westin Boston Waterfront litigation settlement recorded in 2014, as well as higher employee-related costs in 2015.\nGain on insurance proceeds. The gain on insurance proceeds of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to proceeds received to recover property damage losses under our property insurance policy related to an electrical fire at the Lexington Hotel New York.\nGain on litigation settlement. In May 2014, we settled a legal action alleging certain issues related to the original construction of the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel with the contractors and their insurers for $14.0 million in full and complete satisfaction of our claims against the contractors. The settlement resulted in a net gain of $11.0 million. We recorded the settlement net of a $1.2 million contingency fee paid to our legal counsel and $1.8 million of legal fees and other costs incurred over the course of the legal proceedings, which were previously recorded as corporate expenses.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net decreased $2.3 million from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to our not recording interest income on the Allerton loan during the year ended December 31, 2015, since the loan was prepaid on May 21, 2014.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense was $52.7 million and $58.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and is comprised of the following (in millions):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility interest and unused fees\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premium\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate cap fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is related to the repayment of the mortgage loan secured by the Los Angeles Airport Marriott in connection with the sale of the hotel in December 2014, the prepayments of the mortgage loan secured by Frenchman's Reef in May 2015, the mortgage loan secured by the Orlando Airport Marriott in October 2015, the amendment to the mortgage loan secured by the Lexington Hotel New York in October 2014, which reduced the interest rate, and lower interest rates on our refinanced mortgage loans.\nGain on repayments of notes receivable. In November 2015, we received $3.9 million for the repayment of the fully reserved loan we provided to the buyer of the Oak Brook Hills Resort upon sale of the hotel in 2014. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a gain of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. In May 2014, we received $58.5 million for the prepayment of the senior mortgage loan secured by Allerton Hotel. As a result of the prepayment, we recorded a gain of $13.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGain on sale of hotel properties, net. On April 14, 2014, we sold the Oak Brook Hills Resort for $30.1 million, which resulted in a net gain of $1.3 million. On December 18, 2014, we sold the Los Angeles Airport Marriott for total proceeds of approximately $160 million and recognized a gain of $49.7 million.\nGain on hotel property acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $23.9 million related to our purchase of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central in New York as the fair value of the hotel increased from our contractual purchase price at the time we entered into the purchase and sale agreement in 2011 to the fair value at the closing date of August 29, 2014.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. We prepaid the $82.6 million mortgage loan previously secured by the Los Angeles Airport Marriott in connection with the sale of the hotel in December 2014 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.6 million.\nIncome taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $11.6 million in 2015 and $5.6 million in 2014. The 2015 income tax expense includes $11.3 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.1 million pre-tax income of our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, and foreign income tax expense of $0.3 million incurred on the $7.2 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef. The 2014 income tax expense includes $5.3 million of income tax expense incurred on the $11.9 million pre-tax income of our TRS, and foreign income tax expense of $0.3 million incurred on the $5.5 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund distributions to our stockholders to maintain our REIT status as well as to pay for operating expenses and capital expenditures directly associated with our hotels, funding of share repurchases, if any, under our share repurchase program, funding potential hotel acquisitions, debt repayments upon maturity and scheduled debt payments of interest and principal. We currently expect that our available cash flows, which are generally provided through net cash from hotel operations, existing cash balances, equity issuances, proceeds from new financings and refinancings of maturing debt, proceeds from potential property dispositions, and, if necessary, short-term borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\nSome of our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap\u201d provisions that are triggered when the hotel's operating results\nfall below a certain debt service coverage ratio. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. During the third quarter, the cash trap provision was triggered on the mortgage loan secured by the Lexington Hotel New York.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels, renovations, and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels, scheduled debt payments, debt maturities and making distributions to our stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including cash provided by operations, borrowings, issuances of additional equity and/or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the state of the credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders. Our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets, investor sentiment and intended use of proceeds. We may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives and require liquidity in excess of existing cash balances. Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on, among other things, general market conditions for hotel companies and REITs and market perceptions about us.\nATM Program\nWe have equity distribution agreements, as amended, with a number of sales agents (the ATM Program\") to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 200 million (the ATM Shares\u201d). Sales of the ATM Shares can be made in privately negotiated transactions and/or any other method permitted by law, including sales deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering, which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange.\nWe have not sold any shares under the ATM Program since January 2015. As of December 31, 2016, $128.3 million of the ATM Shares were available to be sold under the ATM Program. Actual future sales of the ATM Shares depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and the Company's capital needs. We have no obligation to sell the ATM Shares under the ATM Program.\nOur Financing Strategy\nSince our formation in 2004, we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. The majority of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt. We have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide balance sheet flexibility. We expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle. We believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through the use of a highly leveraged capital structure.\nWe prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure. We have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units to outside limited partners or preferred stock. We structure our hotel acquisitions to be straightforward and to fit within our capital structure; however, we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available.\nWe believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, we had $920.5 million of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and a weighted average maturity date of approximately 5.9 years. We maintain one of the most durable and lowest levered balance sheets among our lodging REIT peers. We maintain balance sheet flexibility with limited near-term debt maturities, capacity under our senior unsecured credit facility and 17 of our 26 hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt. We remain committed to our core strategy of maintaining a simple capital structure with conservative leverage.\nInformation about our financing activities is available in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has approved a $150 million share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock. Information about our share repurchase program is found in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 728,237 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.92 per share for a total purchase price of $6.5 million. We have not repurchased any additional shares subsequent to December 31, 2016 and through February 27, 2017. We retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates. As of February 27, 2017, we have $143.5 million of authorized capacity remaining under our share repurchase program. Currently, we do not expect to utilize our share repurchase program unless we believe our cost of capital is elevated.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOther than borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, we do not utilize short-term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements.\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility\nWe are party to a $300 million senior unsecured credit facility expiring in May 2020. Information about our senior unsecured credit facility is found in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility.\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan\nWe are party to a $100 million senior unsecured term loan expiring in May 2021. Information about our senior unsecured term loan is found in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of cash are net cash flow from hotel operations and borrowings under mortgage debt, term loans, our senior unsecured credit facility and proceeds from hotel dispositions. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, debt service, debt maturities, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate expenses and dividends. As of December 31, 2016, we had $243.1 million of unrestricted corporate cash and $46.1 million of restricted cash, as well as no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nOur net cash provided by operations was $215.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations offset by cash paid for corporate expenses and other working capital changes.\nOur net cash provided by investing activities was $85.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of $183.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Orlando Airport Marriott, Hilton Minneapolis and Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, the net return of $4.6 million from lender reserves, offset by capital expenditures at our hotels of $102.9 million.\nOur net cash used in financing activities was $271.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of our $249.8 million repayment of the mortgage debt secured by the Chicago Marriott and Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue, $100.8 million of dividend payments, $7.2 million paid to repurchase shares under our share repurchase program and upon the vesting of restricted stock for the payment of tax withholding obligations, $2.8 million of financing costs related to our senior unsecured credit facility and term loan, and $11.2 million of scheduled mortgage debt principal payments, partially offset by $100.0 million of proceeds from our senior unsecured term loan.\nWe currently anticipate our significant source of cash for the year ending December 31, 2017 will be the net cash flow from hotel operations. We expect our estimated uses of cash for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2017 will be potential share repurchases, if any, potential hotel acquisitions, regularly scheduled debt service payments, capital expenditures, dividends, and corporate expenses.\nDividend Policy\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our REIT taxable income to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings (other than the earnings of our TRS, which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates) and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to REITs under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>90% of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code, minus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any excess non-cash income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors, including our financial performance, restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditure requirements, the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth the dividends on our common shares for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividend\nper Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 14, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 13, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 12, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 12, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nThe management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement reserves to cover, among other things, the cost of replacing and repairing furniture, fixtures and equipment at our hotels and other routine capital expenditures. Contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues. In addition, we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement reserves under the applicable management or franchise agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we have set aside $38.3 million for capital projects in property improvement funds, which are included in restricted cash.\nWe spent approximately $102.9 million on capital improvements during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included the following significant projects:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Gwen, a Luxury Collection Hotel: We rebranded the Conrad Chicago to Marriott's Luxury Collection brand in 2015.

We have committed to these projects and anticipate making similar arrangements in the future with our existing properties or any future properties that we may acquire.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nUse and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nEBITDA and FFO\nEBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), which defines FFO as net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results.\nAdjustments to EBITDA and FFO\nWe adjust EBITDA and FFO when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO, when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDA and FFO, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated operating performance. We adjust EBITDA and FFO for the following items:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-Cash Ground Rent: We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of rent from our ground lease obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable lease assets. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-Cash Amortization of Favorable and Unfavorable Contracts: We exclude the non-cash amortization of the favorable and unfavorable contracts recorded in conjunction with certain acquisitions because the non-cash amortization is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle: Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we excluded the pre-opening costs in connection with the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other Items: From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels.

Additionally, the gain or loss on dispositions and impairment losses are based on historical cost accounting and represent either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any fair value adjustments to debt instruments. We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company. Specifically, we exclude the impact of the non-cash amortization of the debt premium recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of the JW Marriott Denver at Cherry Creek and fair market value adjustments to the Company's interest rate cap agreement.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of our U.S. GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash ground rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash amortization of favorable and unfavorable contracts, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,651\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of hotel properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on hotel property acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,894\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on insurance proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on litigation settlement (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on repayments of notes receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel manager transition and pre-opening costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reversal of previously recognized Allerton income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance costs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease preparation costs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes $14.0 million of settlement proceeds, net of a $1.2 million contingency fee paid to our legal counsel and $1.8 million of legal fees and\nother costs incurred over the course of the legal proceedings for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained\nabsent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DiamondRock Hospitality Company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates:\nInvestment in Hotels. Acquired hotels, land improvements, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value. Additions to property and equipment, including current buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 15 to 40 years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment. Identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts, including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements, which are recorded at fair value. Above-market and below-market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts. Contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value. We enter into a hotel management agreement at the time of acquisition and such agreements are generally based on market terms. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data. Management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investments in hotels may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel's carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss is recognized. Fair market value is estimated based on market data, estimated cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate, comparable sales information and other considerations requiring management to use its judgment in determining the assumptions used.\nWhile our hotels have experienced improvement in certain key operating measures as the general economic conditions improve, the operating performance at certain of our hotels has not achieved our expected levels. As part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we assess underperforming hotels for possible disposition, which could result in a reduction in the carrying values of these properties.\nInflation\nOperators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates.\nSeasonality\nThe periods during which our hotels experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. Accordingly, we expect some seasonality in our business. Volatility in our financial performance from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to recently issued accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations report provides an overview of DiamondRock Hospitality Company, a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a real estate investment trust (REIT).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of 26 premium hotels and resorts that contain 9,472 guest rooms located in 17 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n \u2022 Occupancy percentage; \n \u2022 Average Daily Rate (or ADR); \n \u2022 Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR); \n \u2022 Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA; and \n \u2022 Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO. \nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 73% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOverview of 2016\nDuring 2016, we executed on our asset management initiatives to improve our portfolio's operating results. We improved our portfolio quality and lowered our financial leverage through the disposition of three non-core hotels and improved our financial flexibility through increasing and extending our corporate credit facility and entering into a new unsecured term loan. Key highlights for 2016 include the following:\nMortgage Loan Repayments. On January 11, 2016, we repaid the $201.7 million mortgage loan secured by the Chicago Marriott Downtown. On May 11, 2016, we repaid the $48.1 million mortgage loan secured by the Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue.\nAmended Credit Facility and New Term Loan. During 2016, we amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facility to increase the capacity to $300 million, decrease the pricing and extend the maturity date to May 2020. We also closed on a new five-year $100 million senior unsecured term loan in 2016.\nHotel Dispositions. In June 2016, we sold the 485-room Orlando Airport Marriott for a contractual sales price of $63 million and the 821-room Hilton Minneapolis for a contractual sales price of $140 million. In July 2016, we sold the 169-room Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City for a contractual sales price of $65 million.\nShare Repurchases. We repurchased 728,237 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.92 per share for a total purchase price of $6.5 million during the second half of 2016.\nOutlook for 2017\nWe believe the economic growth outlook for 2017 has recently improved modestly based on the potential for national tax reform, deregulation, and other economic stimulus. We believe that this improved economic growth outlook will support lodging fundamentals. Unemployment continues to remain low and consumer confidence has increased in recent months.\nWe expect 2017 will be the U.S. lodging industry's eighth year of consecutive growth, albeit moderate growth. Supply increases, particularly in urban markets, will likely hamper rate growth. Our portfolio is weighted towards urban markets, specifically New York City and Chicago, which are two markets with recent and expected supply increases in excess of national averages.\nWe enter 2017 with several favorable factors, including: (1) ownership of a high-quality portfolio concentrated in urban and resort locations; (2) increased internal growth from the continuation of our asset management initiatives and recent hotel renovations; (3) low leveraged capital structure and only one near-term debt maturity; and (4) an unrestricted cash balance of $243 million and no outstanding borrowings on our $300 million senior unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information for the year ended December 31, 2016 for each of the hotels we owned during 2016.\n\n________________\n(1) The percentage change from 2015 RevPAR reflects the comparable period in 2015 to our 2016 ownership period for all hotels.\n(2) The hotel was sold on June 30, 2016. The operating statistics reflect the period from January 1, 2016 to June 29, 2016.\n(3) The hotel was sold on June 8, 2016. The operating statistics reflect the period from January 1, 2016 to June 7, 2016.\n(4) The hotel was sold on July 7, 2016. The operating statistics reflect the period from January 1, 2016 to July 6, 2016.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue. Revenue consists primarily of the room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, as follows (in millions):\n\nOur total revenues decreased $34.4 million from $931.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $896.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our total revenues include amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$1.3 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$10.6 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\n\u2022$13.5 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016.\n\u2022$29.8 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016.\n\u2022$7.6 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016.\nExcluding these non-comparable amounts our total revenues increased $4.6 million, or 0.5%.\nThe following are key hotel operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The 2015 amounts reflect the period in 2015 comparable to our ownership period in 2016 for our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and the Sheraton Suites Key West, and our dispositions of the Orlando Airport Marriott, Hilton Minneapolis, and Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City.\n\nExcluding non-comparable amounts, our rooms revenues increased $1.9 million. The increase in room revenues is primarily a result of a 30.3% increase in contract business and a 0.3% increase in the business transient segment, partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in group business.\nFood and beverage revenues decreased $13.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes amounts that are not comparable period-over-period as follows:\n\u2022$0.3 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$1.1 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\n\u2022$4.5 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016.\n\u2022$10.6 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016.\n\u2022$0.1 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016.\nExcluding these non-comparable amounts, food and beverage revenues increased $0.4 million, or 0.2%.\nOther revenues, which primarily represent spa, parking, resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees, increased by $2.0 million. Excluding non-comparable amounts, our other revenues increased $2.3 million, driven primarily by higher resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees.\nHotel operating expenses. The operating expenses consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nOur hotel operating expenses decreased $31.1 million from $649.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $618.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in hotel operating expenses includes amounts that are not comparable quarter-over-quarter as follows:\n\u2022$1.0 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$5.5 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\n\u2022$10.5 million decrease from the Orlando Airport Marriott, which was sold on June 8, 2016.\n\u2022$21.2 million decrease from the Minneapolis Hilton, which was sold on June 30, 2016.\n\u2022$4.5 million decrease from the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City, which was sold on July 7, 2016.\nExcluding the non-comparable amounts, hotel operating expenses decreased $1.4 million, or 0.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. Other departmental expenses decreased primarily due to reclassifications of certain expenses in 2016 to comply with the 11th Edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our 2016 hotel dispositions, partially offset by increased depreciation from our recent hotel renovations.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel. We did not recognize any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We had no hotel acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.5 million, from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and the reversal of $0.7 million of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of equity awards related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, partially offset by an increase in other employee compensation and audit fees in 2016.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense was $41.7 million and $52.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is comprised of the following (in millions):\n\nThe decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is related to the refinancing of a portion of our total debt at lower interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate for our debt decreased from 4.5% as of December 31, 2015 to 3.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nGain on repayments of notes receivable. In November 2015, we received $3.9 million for the repayment of the fully reserved loan we provided to the buyer of the Oak Brook Hills Resort upon sale of the hotel in 2014. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a gain of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $12.4 million in 2016 and $11.6 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax expense includes $12.4 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.4 million pre-tax income of our TRS. There was no foreign income tax expense incurred on the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef. The 2015 income tax expense includes $11.3 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.1 million pre-tax income of our TRS, $0.3 million of foreign income tax expense incurred on the $7.2 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue. Revenue consists primarily of the room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, as follows (in millions):\n\nOur total revenues from continuing operations increased $58.1 million from $872.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $931.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase includes amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$2.3 million decrease from the Oak Brook Hills Resort, which was sold on April 14, 2014.\n\u2022$51.4 million decrease from the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, which was sold on December 18, 2014.\n\u2022$5.9 million increase from the Inn at Key West, which was purchased on August 15, 2014.\n\u2022$16.2 million increase from the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, which opened on September 1, 2014.\n\u2022$40.6 million increase from the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which was purchased on December 3, 2014.\n\u2022$13.0 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$7.8 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\nExcluding these non-comparable amounts our total revenues increased $28.3 million, or 3.5%.\nThe following pro forma key hotel operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 assume we owned each of our 29 hotels since January 1, 2014 and excludes the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central for the period from January 1, 2014 to August 31, 2014 since the hotel opened on September 1, 2014.\n\nRoom revenue increased across each of our three major customer segments. Revenue from the leisure transient segment experienced the highest growth at 9.8%. Business transient revenue increased 3.9%, and group revenue increased 2.5%. The growth in the group and business transient segments was driven by increases in ADR, offset by slight declines in occupancy. The leisure transient segment growth was the result of a 7% increase in demand and a 2.6% increase in ADR.\nFood and beverage revenues increased $13.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, which includes amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$1.2 million decrease from the Oak Brook Hills Resort, which was sold on April 14, 2014.\n\u2022$14.3 million decrease from the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, which was sold on December 18, 2014.\n\u2022$0.5 million increase from the Inn at Key West, which was purchased on August 15, 2014.\n\u2022$14.1 million increase from the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which was purchased on December 3, 2014.\n\u2022$2.9 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$0.8 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\nExcluding these non-comparable amounts, food and beverage revenues increased $10.3 million, or 5.7%, driven primarily by increased banquet and catering revenues, which included an over 10% increase in banquet and group contribution per room.\nOther revenues, which primarily represent spa, parking, resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees, increased by $0.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the implementation of resort fees at certain hotels, partially offset by a decrease due to hotels sold in 2014.\nHotel operating expenses. The operating expenses consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nOur hotel operating expenses increased $25.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in hotel operating expenses includes amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$3.8 million decrease from the Oak Brook Hills Resort, which was sold on April 14, 2014.\n\u2022$39.6 million decrease from the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, which was sold on December 18, 2014.\n\u2022$2.7 million increase from the Inn at Key West, which was purchased on August 15, 2014.\n\u2022$9.8 million increase from the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, which opened on September 1, 2014.\n\u2022$27.3 million increase from the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which was purchased on December 3, 2014.\n\u2022$8.6 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$4.8 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\nExcluding the non-comparable amounts, hotel operating expenses increased $15.2 million, or 2.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. Franchise fees increased $6.7 million, or 43.8%, primarily due to the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, higher franchise fees at the Lexington Hotel New York and the acquisitions of the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort and Sheraton Suites Key West. Property taxes increased $7.1 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to property tax reassessments at our properties, particularly our Chicago hotels, as well as newly acquired hotels. Incentive management fees decreased $1.1 million, or 12.9%, primarily due to an amendment to the management agreement at the Chicago Marriott Downtown, which reduced management fees beginning in April 2015. Hotel pre-opening and transition costs increased $0.7 million, or 70%, primarily due to the rebranding of the hotel formerly known as the Conrad Chicago to The Gwen, a Luxury Collection Hotel, in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to depreciation on capital expenditures from our recent hotel renovations, partially offset by an increase in fully depreciated furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We incurred $2.1 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with the acquisitions of the Inn at Key West, Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central and Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses increased $1.8 million year over year. The increase is due primarily to the reimbursement of $1.8 million of previously incurred legal and other costs from the proceeds of the Westin Boston Waterfront litigation settlement recorded in 2014, as well as higher employee-related costs in 2015.\nGain on insurance proceeds. The gain on insurance proceeds of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to proceeds received to recover property damage", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in \"Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nOverview\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused real estate company operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes that owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a portfolio of 26 premium hotels and resorts that contain 9,472 guest rooms located in 17 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel.\nKey Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance\nWe use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include:\n \u2022 Occupancy percentage; \n \u2022 Average Daily Rate (or ADR); \n \u2022 Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR); \n \u2022 Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA; and \n \u2022 Funds From Operations (or FFO) and Adjusted FFO. \nOccupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 73% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms.\nOur ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands.\nWe also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nOverview of 2016\nDuring 2016, we executed on our asset management initiatives to improve our portfolio's operating results. We improved our portfolio quality and lowered our financial leverage through the disposition of three non-core hotels and improved our financial flexibility through increasing and extending our corporate credit facility and entering into a new unsecured term loan. Key highlights for 2016 include the following:\nMortgage Loan Repayments. On January 11, 2016, we repaid the $201.7 million mortgage loan secured by the Chicago Marriott Downtown. On May 11, 2016, we repaid the $48.1 million mortgage loan secured by the Courtyard Manhattan Fifth Avenue.\nAmended Credit Facility and New Term Loan. During 2016, we amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facility to increase the capacity to $300 million, decrease the pricing and extend the maturity date to May 2020. We also closed on a new five-year $100 million senior unsecured term loan in 2016.\nHotel Dispositions. In June 2016, we sold the 485-room Orlando Airport Marriott for a contractual sales price of $63 million and the 821-room Hilton Minneapolis for a contractual sales price of $140 million. In July 2016, we sold the 169-room Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea/New York City for a contractual sales price of $65 million.\nShare Repurchases. We repurchased 728,237 shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.92 per share for a total purchase price of $6.5 million during the second half of 2016.\nOutlook for 2017\nWe believe the economic growth outlook for 2017 has recently improved modestly based on the potential for national tax reform, deregulation, and other economic stimulus. We believe that this improved economic growth outlook will support lodging fundamentals. Unemployment continues to remain low and consumer confidence has increased in recent months.\nWe expect 2017 will be the U.S. lodging industry's eighth year of consecutive growth, albeit moderate growth. Supply increases, particularly in urban markets, will likely hamper rate growth. Our portfolio is weighted towards urban markets, specifically New York City and Chicago, which are two markets with recent and expected supply increases in excess of national averages.\nWe enter 2017 with several favorable factors, including: (1) ownership of a high-quality portfolio concentrated in urban and resort locations; (2) increased internal growth from the continuation of our asset management initiatives and recent hotel renovations; (3) low leveraged capital structure and only one near-term debt maturity; and (4) an unrestricted cash balance of $243 million and no outstanding borrowings on our $300 million senior unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operating information for the year ended December 31, 2016 for each of the hotels we owned during 2016.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nRooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ADR($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RevPAR($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\nfrom 2015\nRevPAR (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chicago Marriott\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Chicago, Illinois\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hilton Minneapolis (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Minneapolis, Minnesota\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Boston, Massachusetts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lexington Hotel New York\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York, New York\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Salt Lake City, Utah\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renaissance Worthington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Worth, Texas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Frenchman's Reef & Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orlando Airport Marriott (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Orlando, Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin San Diego\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>San Diego, California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Westin Washington, D.C.

Other departmental expenses decreased primarily due to reclassifications of certain expenses in 2016 to comply with the 11th Edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $3.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our 2016 hotel dispositions, partially offset by increased depreciation from our recent hotel renovations.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel. We did not recognize any impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We had no hotel acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses decreased $0.5 million, from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and the reversal of $0.7 million of previously recognized compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of equity awards related to the resignation of our former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, partially offset by an increase in other employee compensation and audit fees in 2016.\nInterest expense. Our interest expense was $41.7 million and $52.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is comprised of the following (in millions):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage debt interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan interest\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility interest and unused fees\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premium\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate cap fair value adjustment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in mortgage debt interest expense is related to the refinancing of a portion of our total debt at lower interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate for our debt decreased from 4.5% as of December 31, 2015 to 3.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nGain on repayments of notes receivable. In November 2015, we received $3.9 million for the repayment of the fully reserved loan we provided to the buyer of the Oak Brook Hills Resort upon sale of the hotel in 2014. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a gain of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $12.4 million in 2016 and $11.6 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax expense includes $12.4 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.4 million pre-tax income of our TRS. There was no foreign income tax expense incurred on the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef. The 2015 income tax expense includes $11.3 million of income tax expense incurred on the $29.1 million pre-tax income of our TRS, $0.3 million of foreign income tax expense incurred on the $7.2 million pre-tax income of the TRS that owns Frenchman's Reef.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue.

Revenue from the leisure transient segment experienced the highest growth at 9.8%. Business transient revenue increased 3.9%, and group revenue increased 2.5%. The growth in the group and business transient segments was driven by increases in ADR, offset by slight declines in occupancy. The leisure transient segment growth was the result of a 7% increase in demand and a 2.6% increase in ADR.\nFood and beverage revenues increased $13.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, which includes amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$1.2 million decrease from the Oak Brook Hills Resort, which was sold on April 14, 2014.\n\u2022$14.3 million decrease from the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, which was sold on December 18, 2014.\n\u2022$0.5 million increase from the Inn at Key West, which was purchased on August 15, 2014.\n\u2022$14.1 million increase from the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which was purchased on December 3, 2014.\n\u2022$2.9 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$0.8 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\nExcluding these non-comparable amounts, food and beverage revenues increased $10.3 million, or 5.7%, driven primarily by increased banquet and catering revenues, which included an over 10% increase in banquet and group contribution per room.\nOther revenues, which primarily represent spa, parking, resort fees and attrition and cancellation fees, increased by $0.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the implementation of resort fees at certain hotels, partially offset by a decrease due to hotels sold in 2014.\nHotel operating expenses.

The increase in hotel operating expenses includes amounts that are not comparable year-over-year as follows:\n\u2022$3.8 million decrease from the Oak Brook Hills Resort, which was sold on April 14, 2014.\n\u2022$39.6 million decrease from the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, which was sold on December 18, 2014.\n\u2022$2.7 million increase from the Inn at Key West, which was purchased on August 15, 2014.\n\u2022$9.8 million increase from the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, which opened on September 1, 2014.\n\u2022$27.3 million increase from the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which was purchased on December 3, 2014.\n\u2022$8.6 million increase from the Shorebreak Hotel, which was purchased on February 6, 2015.\n\u2022$4.8 million increase from the Sheraton Suites Key West, which was purchased on June 30, 2015.\nExcluding the non-comparable amounts, hotel operating expenses increased $15.2 million, or 2.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. Franchise fees increased $6.7 million, or 43.8%, primarily due to the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central, higher franchise fees at the Lexington Hotel New York and the acquisitions of the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort and Sheraton Suites Key West. Property taxes increased $7.1 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to property tax reassessments at our properties, particularly our Chicago hotels, as well as newly acquired hotels. Incentive management fees decreased $1.1 million, or 12.9%, primarily due to an amendment to the management agreement at the Chicago Marriott Downtown, which reduced management fees beginning in April 2015. Hotel pre-opening and transition costs increased $0.7 million, or 70%, primarily due to the rebranding of the hotel formerly known as the Conrad Chicago to The Gwen, a Luxury Collection Hotel, in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over 40 years for the periods subsequent to acquisition. Depreciable lives of hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment will be replaced. Our depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to depreciation on capital expenditures from our recent hotel renovations, partially offset by an increase in fully depreciated furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nImpairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million on the favorable lease asset related to a tenant lease at the Lexington Hotel New York and $9.6 million on the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel for the development of a new hotel.\nHotel acquisition costs. We incurred $0.9 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our acquisitions of the Shorebreak Hotel and Sheraton Suites Key West, as well as additional transfer taxes on an acquired hotel. We incurred $2.1 million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with the acquisitions of the Inn at Key West, Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central and Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort.\nCorporate expenses. Corporate expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonus and restricted stock. Corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and directors' fees. Our corporate expenses increased $1.8 million year over year. The increase is due primarily to the reimbursement of $1.8 million of previously incurred legal and other costs from the proceeds of the Westin Boston Waterfront litigation settlement recorded in 2014, as well as higher employee-related costs in 2015.\nGain on insurance proceeds. The gain on insurance proceeds of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to proceeds received to recover property damage"}
