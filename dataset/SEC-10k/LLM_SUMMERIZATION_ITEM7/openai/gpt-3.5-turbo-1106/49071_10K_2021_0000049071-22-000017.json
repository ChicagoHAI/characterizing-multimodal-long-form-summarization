MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this 2021 Form 10-K, refer to \"Item 7. - Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nHumana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well-being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in-home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.\nThe health benefits industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.\nKindred at Home Acquisition\nOn August 17, 2021, we acquired the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, or KAH, the nation's largest home health and hospice provider, from TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, two private equity funds, for an enterprise value of $8.2 billion, which includes our equity value of $2.4 billion associated with our 40% minority ownership interest. The remeasurement to fair value of our previously held 40% equity method investment with a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion, resulted in a $1.1 billion gain recognized in \"Other (income) expense, net\". KAH has locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We paid the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price (net of our existing equity stake) through a combination of debt financing, the assumption of existing KAH indebtedness and parent company cash.\nCOVID-19\nThe emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. During periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, non-essential care from a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system consumption decreased utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. The significant disruption in utilization during 2020 also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members, and appropriately document their risk profiles, and, as such, significantly affected our 2021 revenue under the risk adjustment payment model for Medicare Advantage plans. Finally, changes in utilization patterns and actions taken in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time and shifting the timing of claim payments and provider capitation surplus payments, impacted our claim reserve development and operating cash flows for 2020 and 2021.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services. The reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for segment financial information.\nThe Retail segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts. In addition, the Retail segment also includes our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. The Group and Specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO products. In addition, our Group and Specialty segment includes our military services business, primarily our TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. The Healthcare Services segment includes pharmacy, provider, and home services, along with other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. The operations of the recently acquired full ownership of Kindred at Home, as well as the company's strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS) to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers are also included in the Healthcare Services segment.\nThe results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments, or segment earnings. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations.\nSeasonality\nCOVID-19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows largely due to the temporary deferral of non-essential care which resulted in reductions in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of COVID-19 hospital admissions. At the same time, during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increase. Similar impacts and seasonal disruptions from either higher or lower utilization are expected to persist as we respond to and recover from the COVID-19 global health crisis.\nOne of the product offerings of our Retail segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member's cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member's plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our standalone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.\nIn addition, the Retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season.\nOur Group and Specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of Medicare stand-alone PDP in the Retail segment, with the Group and Specialty segment's benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.\nHighlights\n\u2022Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2021, approximately 3,009,600 members, or 68%, of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 2,650,100 members, or 67%, at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022In order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expand our Healthcare Services capability in 2023, we committed to efforts to create additional value through cost savings, productivity initiatives and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we anticipate that we may incur certain charges in 2022.\n\u2022On February 2, 2022, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued its preliminary 2023 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes, collectively, the Advance Notice. CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rate on or before April 4, 2022, or the Final Notice. In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 4.48% increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee-for-service county rebasing/re-pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. Further the benchmark increase excludes MA risk score trend as individual plans' experience will vary. Based on the company's preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS's website, we anticipate the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change generally in line with CMS's estimate. The company will be drawing upon its program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact on Medicare beneficiaries' quality of care and service to its members through the Medicare Advantage program.\n\u2022Net income was $2.9 billion, or $22.67 per diluted common share, and $3.4 billion, or $25.31 per diluted common share, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This comparison was significantly impacted by the gain on our equity method investment in Kindred at Home upon completion of our acquisition of the business, put/call valuation adjustments associated with our non consolidating minority interest investments, the change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities, transaction and integration costs associated with the Kindred at Home acquisition, and the receipt of unpaid risk corridor payments in the third quarter of 2020 that were previously written off. The put/call valuation adjustments included the impact of the termination of the put/call agreement related to Kindred at Home as a result of the signing of the definitive agreement for the transaction on April 27, 2021. The impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for 2021.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on Kindred at Home equity method investment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Put/call valuation adjustments associated with company's non consolidating minority interest investments </td> <td>(597) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration costs associated with Kindred at Home acquisition </td> <td>(128) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities </td> <td>(341) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written-off </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on Kindred at Home equity method investment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Put/call valuation adjustments associated with company's non consolidating minority interest investments </td> <td>(3.56) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.60) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration costs associated with Kindred at Home acquisition </td> <td>(0.72) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities </td> <td>(2.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written-off </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.07 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u25e6Excluding these adjustments, comparisons of our results of operations were materially impacted by the significant, temporary deferral of care in 2020 resulting from stay-at-home orders, physical distancing measures, and other restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19, as well as the impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, which on a net basis significantly and favorably impacted the 2020 period results when compared to the 2021 period results. In addition, the 2021 period results reflect the impact of lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response effort, the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely and charitable contribution cost to support the communities served by us. Combined, the COVID-19 impacts described previously resulted in lower operating results in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\u25e6Partially offsetting the COVID-19 financial headwind that we experienced in 2021, our results of operations for 2021 were favorably impacted by individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contract membership growth and improved operating performance in our Healthcare Services segment, including the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home in August 2021. Further, 2021 was also favorably impacted by the lower tax rate resulting from the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share, primarily reflecting share repurchases.\nHealth Care Reform\nThe Health Care Reform Law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. The annual health insurance\nindustry fee, which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate, was in effect for calendar year 2020 and permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.\nIt is reasonably possible that the Health Care Reform Law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes such as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the \"Families First Act\"), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to COVID-19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.\nWe intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers and are described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operations for 2021 and 2020\nCertain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and

in the 2021 period primarily due to higher premium revenues from Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, higher per member Medicare Advantage premiums as a result of the improving CMS benchmark rate for 2021, net of Medicare Risk Adjustment (MRA) headwinds resulting from COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020, as well as the additional quarter impact of Medicare sequestration relief in 2021 that was not enacted until the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by declining stand-alone PDP, group commercial medical, and group Medicare Advantage membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off.\nServices Revenue\nConsolidated services revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 68.3%, from $1.8 billion in the 2020 period to $3.1 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher home solutions revenues associated with consolidation of Kindred at Home earnings.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income decreased $967 million, or 83.8%, from $1.2 billion in the 2020 period to $187 million in the 2021 period primarily due to a significant decrease in the fair value of our publicly-traded equity securities investments.\nBenefits Expense\nConsolidated benefits expense increased $7.6 billion, or 12.3%, from $61.6 billion in the 2020 period to $69.2 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 360 basis points from 83.1% in the 2020 period to 86.7% in the 2021 period. These increases reflect the termination in 2021 of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee which, along with a portion of the related tax benefit, was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, and COVID-19 impacts, including the impact of the deferral of non-essential care, net of meaningful COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, our pandemic relief efforts in 2020, as well as 2021 MRA headwinds resulting from this COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020. The year over year increase further reflects the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off, and the 2021 impact associated with the competitive nature of the group Medicare Advantage business, particularly in large group accounts that were recently procured, as well as in the stand-alone PDP business. These factors were partially offset by higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2021.\nThe higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns. The suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the 2021 period versus approximately 40 basis points in the 2020 period.\nOperating Costs\nOur segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.\nConsolidated operating costs increased $0.07 billion, or 0.7%, from $10.05 billion in the 2020 period to $10.12 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 13.2% in the 2020 period to 12.2% in the 2021 period. The ratio decrease was primarily due to the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response efforts, and the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely. The decrease was\nfurther impacted by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership, operating cost efficiencies in 2021 from previously implemented productivity initiatives, as well as the impact of a $200 million contribution to the Humana Foundation in the first half of 2020 to support communities served by the Company, particularly those with social and health disparities. These factors were partially offset by the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations as the business has a significantly higher operating cost ratio than our historical consolidated operating cost ratio, continued strategic and technology modernization investments made to position us for long-term success, transaction and integration costs associated with the Kindred at Home transaction, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in the 2020 period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $107 million, or 21.9%, from $489 million in the 2020 period to $596 million in the 2021 period primarily due to capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $43 million, or 15.2%, from $283 million in the 2020 period to $326 million in the 2021 period from borrowings to fund the KAH acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate during 2021 was 14.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 28.0% in 2020. The change was primarily due to the non-taxable gain we recognized on our previously held Kindred at Home equity method investment from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the business in August 2021 and the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.\nRetail Segment\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nSegment Earnings\n\u2022Retail segment earnings decreased $1.1 billion, or 35.8%, from $3.0 billion in the 2020 period to $1.9 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to the same factors reflecting the segment's higher benefit ratio, partially offset by the segment's lower operating cost ratio as more fully described below.\nEnrollment\n\u2022Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 446,400 members, or 11.3%, from 3,962,700 members as of December 31, 2020 to 4,409,100 members as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to membership additions associated with the previous Annual Election Period, or AEP, and Open Election Period, or OEP, for Medicare beneficiaries. The membership growth was further impacted by continued enrollment resulting from special elections, age-ins, and Dual Eligible Special Need Plans, or D-SNP, members. The OEP sales period, which ran from January 1 to March 31, 2021 added approximately 36,000 members compared to the 2020 OEP that added approximately 30,000 members. Individual Medicare Advantage membership includes 576,100 D-SNP members as of December 31, 2021, a net increase of 170,000 members, or 42%, from 406,100 members as of December 31, 2020. For the full year 2022, we anticipate a net membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage offerings of approximately 150,000 to 200,000 members.\n\u2022Group Medicare Advantage membership decreased 52,600 members, or 8.6%, from 613,200 members as of December 31, 2020 to 560,600 members as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to the net loss of certain large accounts in January 2021, partially offset by continued growth in small group accounts. For the full year 2022, we anticipate relatively flat membership growth.\n\u2022Medicare stand-alone PDP membership decreased 260,500 members, or 6.7%, from 3,866,700 members as of December 31, 2020 to 3,606,200 members as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to anticipated declines as a result of the Walmart Value plan no longer being the low cost leader in 2021. For the full year 2022, we anticipate a net membership decline in our Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings of approximately 125,000 members.\n\u2022State-based Medicaid membership increased 167,700 members, or 21.7%, from 772,400 members as of December 31, 2020 to 940,100 members as of December 31, 2021 primarily reflecting additional\nenrollment as a result of the suspension of state eligibility redetermination efforts due to the currently-enacted Public Health Emergency, as well as the recently completed acquisition of our remaining 50% ownership interest in Wisconsin health care company iCare. For the full year 2022, we anticipate a net membership decline in our state-based contracts of approximately 50,000 to 100,000 members assuming the Public Health Emergency will end in April 2022.\nPremiums revenue\n\u2022Retail segment premiums increased $6.7 billion, or 10.0%, from $67.1 billion in the 2020 period to $73.8 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher premiums as a result of individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, higher per member individual Medicare Advantage premiums as a result of the improving CMS benchmark rate for 2021, net of MRA headwinds resulting from COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020, as well as the additional quarter impact of Medicare sequestration relief in 2021 that was not enacted until the second quarter of 2020. These favorable items were partially offset by the decline in membership in our stand-alone PDP and group Medicare Advantage offerings.\nBenefits expense\n\u2022The Retail segment benefit ratio increased 370 basis points from 84.2% in the 2020 period to 87.9% in the 2021 period primarily due to the termination in 2021 of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee which, along with a portion of the related tax benefit, was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, COVID-19 impacts, including the impact of the deferral of non-essential care, net of meaningful COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, our pandemic relief efforts in 2020, as well as 2021 MRA headwinds resulting from this COVD-19 related utilization disruption in 2020. Also contributing to the higher benefit ratio was the 2021 impact of the competitive nature of the group Medicare Advantage business, particularly in large group accounts that were recently procured, as well as in the stand-alone PDP business. These factors were partially offset by higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development.\n\u2022The Retail segment's benefits expense for the 2021 period includes the beneficial effect of $729 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $266 million in 2020. This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in 2021 versus approximately 40 basis points in 2020. The higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns. The suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating costs\n\u2022The Retail segment operating cost ratio decreased 180 basis points from 11.0% in the 2020 period to 9.2% in the 2021 period primarily due to the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, lower COVID-19 related administrative costs, as previously discussed, scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership, as well as operating cost efficiencies driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by continued strategic investments made in 2021 to position us for long-term success. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in the 2020 period.\nGroup and Specialty Segment\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Members </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Membership: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical membership: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fully-insured commercial group </td> <td> </td> <td>674,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>777,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102,800) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ASO </td> <td> </td> <td>495,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,400) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Military services </td> <td> </td> <td>6,049,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,998,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total group medical members </td> <td> </td> <td>7,219,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,281,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61,900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty membership (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>5,294,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,310,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,000) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Specialty products include dental, vision, and life insurance benefits.

The portion of group fully-insured commercial medical membership in small group accounts was approximately 50% at December 31, 2021 and 54% at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 9,400 members, or 1.9%, from 504,900 members as of December 31, 2020 to 495,500 members as of December 31, 2021. Small group membership comprised 43% of group ASO medical membership at December 31, 2021 and 45% at December 31, 2020. The membership change reflects intensified competition for small group accounts, partially offset by strong retention among large group accounts. For the full year 2022, we anticipate a net membership decline in our group commercial medical offerings, which includes fully-insured and ASO, of approximately 125,000 to 165,000 members.\n\u2022Military services membership increased 50,300 members, or 0.8%, from 5,998,700 members as of December 31, 2020 to 6,049,000 members as of December 31, 2021. Membership includes military service members, retirees, and their families to whom we are providing healthcare services under the current TRICARE East Region contract.\n\u2022Specialty membership decreased 16,000 members, or 0.3%, from 5,310,300 members as of December 31, 2020 to 5,294,300 members as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to the loss of dental and vision groups cross-sold with medical, as reflected in the loss of group fully-insured commercial medical membership described above. The decrease also reflects the impact of the economic downturn driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPremiums revenue\n\u2022Group and Specialty segment premiums decreased $458 million, or 7.1%, from $6.5 billion in the 2020 period to $6.0 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to the decline in our fully-insured group commercial membership, partially offset by higher per member premiums across the fully-insured commercial business.\nServices revenue\n\u2022Group and Specialty segment services revenue increased $36 million, or 4.6%, from $780 million in the 2020 period to $816 million in the 2021 period primarily due to higher TRICARE services revenue partially offset by lower ASO membership described previously.\nBenefits expense\n\u2022The Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio decreased 310 basis points from 85.6% in the 2020 period to 82.5% in the 2021 period. The decrease reflects the negative COVID-19 impacts in 2020 including meaningful COVID-19 treatment and testing costs along with our ongoing pandemic relief efforts, primarily surrounding initiatives to ease administrative and financial stress for providers and employers, net of the impact of the deferral of non-essential care. The comparison was further impacted by the deliberate pricing and benefit design efforts in 2021 to increase profitability and position the commercial business for long-term success, lower specialty utilization, primarily related to dental services in 2021, as well as the beneficial impact of higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2021 period. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by the termination in 2021 of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in which, along with a portion of the related tax benefit, was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products.\n\u2022The Group and Specialty segment's benefits expense includes the beneficial effect of $96 million in prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2021 versus $47 million in 2020. This favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 160 basis points in 2021 versus approximately 70 basis points in 2020.\nOperating costs\n\u2022The Group and Specialty segment operating cost ratio decreased 40 basis points from 25.0% in the 2020 period to 24.6% in the 2021 period primarily due to the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021, as previously discussed, as well as operating cost efficiencies driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives. These were partially offset by continued strategic investments made to position us for long-term success. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 130 basis points in the 2020 period.\nHealthcare Services Segment\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home solutions </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>989.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pharmacy solutions </td> <td> </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provider services </td> <td> </td> <td>413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total services revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>2,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home solutions </td> <td> </td> <td>691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pharmacy solutions </td> <td> </td> <td>25,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provider services </td> <td> </td> <td>2,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total intersegment revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>29,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total services and intersegment revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating cost ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>95.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Earnings\n\u2022Healthcare Services segment earnings increased $385 million, or 40.8%, from $944 million in the 2020 period to $1.3 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to consolidation of Kindred at Home earnings, individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth leading to higher pharmacy revenues, higher revenues associated with growth in the company's provider business, as well as the factors that drove the segment declining operating cost ratio as more fully described below.\nScript Volume\n\u2022Humana Pharmacy Solutions\u00ae script volumes for the Retail and Group and Specialty segment membership increased to approximately 515 million in 2021, up 7.7% versus scripts of approximately 478 million in 2020 primarily due to growth in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug and state-based contracts membership, partially offset by the decline in stand-alone PDP membership.\nServices revenue\n\u2022Services revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 118.1%, from $1.0 billion in the 2020 period to $2.2 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to consolidation of Kindred at Home earnings. The 2021 period further reflects higher revenue from growth in the number of primary care clinics serving third party payors, and additional pharmacy revenues associated with the acquisition of Enclara which was closed during the first quarter of 2020.\nIntersegment revenues\n\u2022Intersegment revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 5.8%, from $27.4 billion in the 2020 period to $29.0 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, as well as higher revenues associated with our provider business. These increases were partially offset by the loss of intersegment revenues associated with the decline in stand-alone PDP and group Medicare Advantage membership as previously discussed.\nOperating costs\n\u2022The Healthcare Services segment operating cost ratio decreased 90 basis points from 96.3% in the 2020 period to 95.4% in the 2021 period primarily due to consolidation of Kindred at Home operations which have a lower operating cost ratio than other businesses within the segment, the 2020 impact associated with COVID-19 administrative related costs, including expenses associated with additional safety measures taken for our pharmacy, provider, and home solutions teams who continued to provide services to members throughout the crisis, as well as operational improvements in our provider services business, largely related to Conviva, along with operating cost efficiencies driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives in 2021. The decrease further reflects the impact of additional investments in the segment's provider business during 2020 related to marketing and AEP initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by increased administrative costs in the pharmacy operations as a result of incremental spend to accelerate growth within the business, increased utilization levels in our provider business in 2021 compared to levels in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increased pharmacy labor-related overtime costs due to weather disruptions occurring in the first quarter of 2021.\nLiquidity\nHistorically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators).\nFor additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to Item 1A. - Risk Factors in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 from $4.7 billion at December 31, 2020. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(6,556) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,065) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,278) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>3,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,955) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,295) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,279) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operations of $2.3 billion in the 2021 period decreased $3.4 billion from cash flows provided by operations of $5.6 billion in the 2020 period primarily due to the negative impact of working capital items and lower earnings in the 2021 period compared to the 2020 period. Our 2021 period operating cash flows were significantly impacted by changes to working capital levels, primarily as a result of prior year disruptions caused by COVID-19. These impacts include paying down claims inventory and capitation for provider surplus amounts earned in 2020 as well as additional provider support.\nThe most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables.\nThe detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported claims in process (2) </td> <td>907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other benefits payable (3) </td> <td>1,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(350) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>811 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to cash flow statement: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in payables from acquisition of business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in benefits payable per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received and processed (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR).\n(2)Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff.\n(3)Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.\nThe increase in benefits payable in 2021 was primarily due to higher IBNR and an increase in reported claims in process partially offset by a reduction in capitation accruals. IBNR increased primarily as a result of individual Medicare Advantage membership growth partially offset by paying down claim inventories. Higher reported claims in process was a function of timing of month-end cutoff. The 2020 period was significantly impacted by higher capitation accruals as significantly lower utilization caused by COVID-19 resulted in higher surplus accruals to providers. These higher surplus accrual to providers were paid down during 2021.\nThe detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and other </td> <td>579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>457 </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Military services </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56) </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for doubtful accounts </td> <td>(83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net receivables </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>676 </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to cash flow statement: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in receivables from (acquisition) disposition of business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(396) </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in receivables per cash flow statement\nresulting in cash used by operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>280 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in Medicare receivables for both the 2021 period and the 2020 period reflect individual Medicare Advantage membership growth and the typical pattern caused by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The increase in Commercial and other receivables in 2021 primarily relates to the Kindred at Home acquisition.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nDuring 2021, we acquired Kindred at Home and other primary care businesses for cash consideration of approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash received.\nDuring 2020, we acquired Enclara Healthcare, a hospice, pharmacy and benefit provider, for cash consideration of approximately $709 million, net of cash received.\nOur ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $1.3 billion, $964 million and $736 million in the 2021, 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively.\nNet purchases of investment securities were $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion, $542 million in the 2021, 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nOur financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Claim payments were higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by $261 million, $938 million and $560 million in the 2021, 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively. Our net receivable from CMS for subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to a net receivable of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020.\nUnder our administrative services only TRICARE contract, health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $45 million, $1 million and $63 million in the 2021, 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively.\nIn August 2021, we issued $1.5 billion of 0.650% unsecured senior notes due August 3, 2023, $750 million of 1.350% unsecured senior notes due February 3, 2027 and $750 million of 2.150% unsecured senior notes due February 3, 2032. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $2,984 million.\nAs of the closing of the acquisition of Kindred at Home in August 2021, we assumed approximately $2.1 billion of borrowings, and subsequently repaid $150 million of borrowings. In October 2021, we entered into a $2.0 billion term loan agreement and applied the proceeds to finance the repayment in full of the outstanding assumed Kindred at Home debt.\nIn May 2021, we entered into a $500 million unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement. In August 2021, we borrowed $500 million under the delayed draw term loan agreement, which was used, in combination with other debt financing, to fund the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price of Kindred at Home.\nIn December 2020, we repaid $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due on their maturity date of December 15, 2020.\nIn March 2020, we drew $1 billion on the existing term loan commitment at the time, which was repaid in November 2020.\nIn March 2020, we issued $600 million of 4.500% senior notes due April 1, 2025 and $500 million of 4.875% senior notes due April 1, 2030. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid, were $1,088 million.\nIn August 2019, we issued $500 million of 3.125% senior notes due August 15, 2029 and $500 million of 3.950% senior notes due August 15, 2049. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid, were $987 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering, together with available cash, to repay the $650 million outstanding amount due under our term note in August 2019, and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.625% senior notes due on its maturity date of October 1, 2019.\nWe repurchased common shares for $0.08 billion, $1.82 billion and $1.07 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under share repurchase plans authorized by the Board of Directors and in connection with employee stock plans.\nWe paid dividends to stockholders of $354 million in 2021, $323 million in 2020, and $291 million in 2019.\nWe entered into a commercial paper program in October 2014. Net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper were $352 million in 2021 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2021 was $1.2 billion. Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $295 million in 2020 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2020 was $600 million. Net repayments from issuance of commercial paper were $360 million in 2019 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2019 was $801 million.\nThe remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2021, 2020, and 2019 primarily resulted from debt issuance costs, proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nDividends\nFor a detailed discussion of dividends to stockholders, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nStock Repurchases\nFor a detailed discussion of stock repurchases, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDebt\nFor a detailed discussion of our debt, including our senior notes, term loans, credit agreement and commercial paper program, please refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nLiquidity Requirements\nWe believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares.\nAdverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2021 was BBB+ according to Standard & Poor's Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody's Investors Services, Inc., or Moody's. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody's to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million.\nIn addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company increased to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021 from $772 million at December 31, 2020. This increase primarily reflects net proceeds from the senior notes and term loans, dividends received from regulated subsidiaries, earnings in non-regulated Healthcare Services subsidiaries, and the issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by acquisitions, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries, capital expenditures, and cash dividends to shareholders. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by regulators. Our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to our parent company of $1.6 billion in 2021, $1.3 billion in 2020, and $1.8 billion in 2019. Subsidiary capital requirements from significant premium growth has impacted the amount of regulated subsidiary dividends over the last two years. Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in Schedule I - Parent Company Financial Information. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2022 is approximately $1.5 billion, in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix.\nRegulatory Requirements\nFor a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to our parent, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or SPE, transactions. For a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nFor a detailed discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications, please refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGovernment Contracts\nFor a detailed discussion of our government contracts, including our Medicare, Military, and Medicaid and state-based contracts, please refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBenefits Expense Recognition\nBenefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported claims in process </td> <td>907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other benefits payable </td> <td>1,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total benefits payable </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. For further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate IBNR, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2021 data:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Factor (a): </td> <td> </td> <td>Claims Trend Factor (b): </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Factor\nChange (c) </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease in\nBenefits Payable </td> <td> </td> <td>Factor\nChange (c) </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease in\nBenefits Payable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.70% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(421) </td> <td> </td> <td>3.00% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(379) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.60% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(361) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.75% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(347) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.50% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(301) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(316) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.40% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(241) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.25% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(284) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.30% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(180) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.00% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(252) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.20% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(120) </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(221) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.10% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(60) </td> <td> </td> <td>1.50% </td> <td> </td> <td>$(189) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2021 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months.\n(b)Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2021 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months.\n(c)The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change.\nThe following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals.

Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $825 million in 2021, $313 million in 2020, and $336 million in 2019. The table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Favorable) Unfavorable Medical Claims Reserve\nDevelopment </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Segment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(729) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(266) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(386) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(463) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Group and Specialty Segment </td> <td>(96) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(825) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(313) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(336) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(512) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable medical claims reserve development for 2021, 2020, and 2019 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. In addition, the higher prior year favorable development for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns. The suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2021 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.\nWe receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. We bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. Changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium.\nPremiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Care Reform Law. We estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the Health Care Reform Law using a methodology prescribed by HHS, separately by state and legal entity. Medicare Advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the Health Care Reform Law. Estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.\nMedicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions\nCMS utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans. Rates paid to MA plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries' risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government's Medicare FFS program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our\nemployees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. CMS is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the Risk Adjustment Processing System, or RAPS, to diagnoses data from the Encounter Data System, or EDS. The RAPS process requires MA plans to apply a filter logic based on CMS guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines. For submissions through EDS, CMS requires MA plans to submit all the encounter data and CMS will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. For 2021, 75% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through EDS. CMS will complete the phased-in transition from RAPS to EDS by using only EDS data to calculate risk scores in 2022. The phase-in from RAPS to EDS could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, CMS processing issues, or filtering logic differences between RAPS and EDS, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership. The risk-adjustment model, including CMS changes to the submission process, is more fully described in Item 1. - Business under the section titled Individual Medicare,\u201d and in Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities totaled $14.0 billion, or 31% of total assets at December 31, 2021, and $13.8 billion, or 39% of total assets at December 31, 2020.

Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the United States with no individual state exceeding 1% of our total debt securities. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types.\nGross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2021:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Less than 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td>12 months or more </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross\nUnrealized\nLosses </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross\nUnrealized\nLosses </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross\nUnrealized\nLosses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury and agency obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities </td> <td>2,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-exempt municipal securities </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities </td> <td>530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt securities </td> <td>1,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(94) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(161) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to January 1, 2020, we applied the other-than-temporary impairment model for securities in an unrealized loss position which did not result in any material impairments for 2019. Beginning on January 1, 2020, we adopted the new current expected credit losses, or CECL, model which retained many similarities from the previous other-than-temporary impairment model except eliminating from consideration in the impairment analysis the length of time over which the fair value had been less than cost. Also, under the CECL model, expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred. In the event of an expected credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder, if any, of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. To the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.\nPotential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security; changes in the quality of the debt security's credit enhancement; payment structure of the debt security; changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies; failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. We estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.\nThe risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods.\nAll issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2021 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased. At December 31, 2021, we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Additionally, we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021 or 2020 There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2019.\nGoodwill, Indefinite-lived and Long-lived Assets\nAt December 31, 2021, goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets represented 38% of total assets and 104% of total stockholders' equity, compared to 20% and 52%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The increase in goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets is primarily attributable to our August 2021 KAH acquisition.\nFor goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition.\nWe perform a quantitative assessment to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Law or changes in government reimbursement rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. However, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, medical and operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our home solutions and provider reporting units, which accounted for $6.6 billion and $933 million of goodwill, respectively. Our home solutions reporting unit includes approximately $5.8 billion of goodwill from our August 2021 KAH acquisition. Impairment tests completed for 2021, 2020, and 2019 did not result in an impairment loss.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets relate to Certificate of Needs (CON) and Medicare licenses acquired in connection with our August 2021 KAH acquisition with a carrying value of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Like goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on the income approach. Impairment tests completed for 2021 did not result in an impairment loss.\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no material impairment losses in the last three years.", "summary": "The report discusses Humana Inc.'s 2021 financial performance.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this 2021 Form 10-K, refer to \"Item 7. - Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nHumana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well-being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in-home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.\nThe health benefits industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.\nKindred at Home Acquisition\nOn August 17, 2021, we acquired the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, or KAH, the nation's largest home health and hospice provider, from TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, two private equity funds, for an enterprise value of $8.2 billion, which includes our equity value of $2.4 billion associated with our 40% minority ownership interest. The remeasurement to fair value of our previously held 40% equity method investment with a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion, resulted in a $1.1 billion gain recognized in \"Other (income) expense, net\". KAH has locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We paid the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price (net of our existing equity stake) through a combination of debt financing, the assumption of existing KAH indebtedness and parent company cash.\nCOVID-19\nThe emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. During periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, non-essential care from a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system consumption decreased utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. The significant disruption in utilization during 2020 also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members, and appropriately document their risk profiles, and, as such, significantly affected our 2021 revenue under the risk adjustment payment model for Medicare Advantage plans. Finally, changes in utilization patterns and actions taken in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time and shifting the timing of claim payments and provider capitation surplus payments, impacted our claim reserve development and operating cash flows for 2020 and 2021.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services. The reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for segment financial information.\nThe Retail segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts. In addition, the Retail segment also includes our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. The Group and Specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO products. In addition, our Group and Specialty segment includes our military services business, primarily our TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. The Healthcare Services segment includes pharmacy, provider, and home services, along with other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. The operations of the recently acquired full ownership of Kindred at Home, as well as the company's strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS) to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers are also included in the Healthcare Services segment.\nThe results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments, or segment earnings. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations.\nSeasonality\nCOVID-19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows largely due to the temporary deferral of non-essential care which resulted in reductions in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of COVID-19 hospital admissions. At the same time, during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increase. Similar impacts and seasonal disruptions from either higher or lower utilization are expected to persist as we respond to and recover from the COVID-19 global health crisis.\nOne of the product offerings of our Retail segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member's cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member's plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our standalone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.\nIn addition, the Retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season.\nOur Group and Specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of Medicare stand-alone PDP in the Retail segment, with the Group and Specialty segment's benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.\nHighlights\n\u2022Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2021, approximately 3,009,600 members, or 68%, of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 2,650,100 members, or 67%, at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022In order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expand our Healthcare Services capability in 2023, we committed to efforts to create additional value through cost savings, productivity initiatives and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we anticipate that we may incur certain charges in 2022.\n\u2022On February 2, 2022, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued its preliminary 2023 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes, collectively, the Advance Notice. CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rate on or before April 4, 2022, or the Final Notice. In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 4.48% increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee-for-service county rebasing/re-pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. Further the benchmark increase excludes MA risk score trend as individual plans' experience will vary. Based on the company's preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS's website, we anticipate the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change generally in line with CMS's estimate. The company will be drawing upon its program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact on Medicare beneficiaries' quality of care and service to its members through the Medicare Advantage program.\n\u2022Net income was $2.9 billion, or $22.67 per diluted common share, and $3.4 billion, or $25.31 per diluted common share, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This comparison was significantly impacted by the gain on our equity method investment in Kindred at Home upon completion of our acquisition of the business, put/call valuation adjustments associated with our non consolidating minority interest investments, the change in the fair value of publicly-traded equity securities, transaction and integration costs associated with the Kindred at Home acquisition, and the receipt of unpaid risk corridor payments in the third quarter of 2020 that were previously written off. The put/call valuation adjustments included the impact of the termination of the put/call agreement related to Kindred at Home as a result of the signing of the definitive agreement for the transaction on April 27, 2021. The impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for 2021.\n\n\u25e6Excluding these adjustments, comparisons of our results of operations were materially impacted by the significant, temporary deferral of care in 2020 resulting from stay-at-home orders, physical distancing measures, and other restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19, as well as the impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, which on a net basis significantly and favorably impacted the 2020 period results when compared to the 2021 period results. In addition, the 2021 period results reflect the impact of lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response effort, the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely and charitable contribution cost to support the communities served by us. Combined, the COVID-19 impacts described previously resulted in lower operating results in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\u25e6Partially offsetting the COVID-19 financial headwind that we experienced in 2021, our results of operations for 2021 were favorably impacted by individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contract membership growth and improved operating performance in our Healthcare Services segment, including the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home in August 2021. Further, 2021 was also favorably impacted by the lower tax rate resulting from the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share, primarily reflecting share repurchases.\nHealth Care Reform\nThe Health Care Reform Law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. The annual health insurance\nindustry fee, which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate, was in effect for calendar year 2020 and permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.\nIt is reasonably possible that the Health Care Reform Law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes such as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the \"Families First Act\"), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to COVID-19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.\nWe intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers and are described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operations for 2021 and 2020\nCertain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nConsolidated\n\n(a)Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue.\n(b)Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income.\nPremiums Revenue\nConsolidated premiums increased $5.6 billion, or 7.6%, from $74.2 billion in the 2020 period to $79.8 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher premium revenues from Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, higher per member Medicare Advantage premiums as a result of the improving CMS benchmark rate for 2021, net of Medicare Risk Adjustment (MRA) headwinds resulting from COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020, as well as the additional quarter impact of Medicare sequestration relief in 2021 that was not enacted until the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by declining stand-alone PDP, group commercial medical, and group Medicare Advantage membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off.\nServices Revenue\nConsolidated services revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 68.3%, from $1.8 billion in the 2020 period to $3.1 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher home solutions revenues associated with consolidation of Kindred at Home earnings.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income decreased $967 million, or 83.8%, from $1.2 billion in the 2020 period to $187 million in the 2021 period primarily due to a significant decrease in the fair value of our publicly-traded equity securities investments.\nBenefits Expense\nConsolidated benefits expense increased $7.6 billion, or 12.3%, from $61.6 billion in the 2020 period to $69.2 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 360 basis points from 83.1% in the 2020 period to 86.7% in the 2021 period. These increases reflect the termination in 2021 of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee which, along with a portion of the related tax benefit, was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, and COVID-19 impacts, including the impact of the deferral of non-essential care, net of meaningful COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, our pandemic relief efforts in 2020, as well as 2021 MRA headwinds resulting from this COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020. The year over year increase further reflects the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off, and the 2021 impact associated with the competitive nature of the group Medicare Advantage business, particularly in large group accounts that were recently procured, as well as in the stand-alone PDP business. These factors were partially offset by higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2021.\nThe higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns. The suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the 2021 period versus approximately 40 basis points in the 2020 period.\nOperating Costs\nOur segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.\nConsolidated operating costs increased $0.07 billion, or 0.7%, from $10.05 billion in the 2020 period to $10.12 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 13.2% in the 2020 period to 12.2% in the 2021 period. The ratio decrease was primarily due to the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response efforts, and the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely. The decrease was\nfurther impacted by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership, operating cost efficiencies in 2021 from previously implemented productivity initiatives, as well as the impact of a $200 million contribution to the Humana Foundation in the first half of 2020 to support communities served by the Company, particularly those with social and health disparities. These factors were partially offset by the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations as the business has a significantly higher operating cost ratio than our historical consolidated operating cost ratio, continued strategic and technology modernization investments made to position us for long-term success, transaction and integration costs associated with the Kindred at Home transaction, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in the 2020 period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $107 million, or 21.9%, from $489 million in the 2020 period to $596 million in the 2021 period primarily due to capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $43 million, or 15.2%, from $283 million in the 2020 period to $326 million in the 2021 period from borrowings to fund the KAH acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate during 2021 was 14.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 28.0% in 2020. The change was primarily due to the non-taxable gain we recognized on our previously held Kindred at Home equity method investment from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the business in August 2021 and the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.\nRetail Segment\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this 2021 Form 10-K, refer to \"Item 7. - Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 18, 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nHumana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well-being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in-home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.\nThe health benefits industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.\nKindred at Home Acquisition\nOn August 17, 2021, we acquired the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, or KAH, the nation's largest home health and hospice provider, from TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, two private equity funds, for an enterprise value of $8.2 billion, which includes our equity value of $2.4 billion associated with our 40% minority ownership interest. The remeasurement to fair value of our previously held 40% equity method investment with a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion, resulted in a $1.1 billion gain recognized in \"Other (income) expense, net\". KAH has locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We paid the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price (net of our existing equity stake) through a combination of debt financing, the assumption of existing KAH indebtedness and parent company cash.\nCOVID-19\nThe emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. During periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, non-essential care from a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system consumption decreased utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. The significant disruption in utilization during 2020 also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members, and appropriately document their risk profiles, and, as such, significantly affected our 2021 revenue under the risk adjustment payment model for Medicare Advantage plans. Finally, changes in utilization patterns and actions taken in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time and shifting the timing of claim payments and provider capitation surplus payments, impacted our claim reserve development and operating cash flows for 2020 and 2021.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services. The reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for segment financial information.\nThe Retail segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts. In addition, the Retail segment also includes our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. The Group and Specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO products. In addition, our Group and Specialty segment includes our military services business, primarily our TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. The Healthcare Services segment includes pharmacy, provider, and home services, along with other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. The operations of the recently acquired full ownership of Kindred at Home, as well as the company's strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS) to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers are also included in the Healthcare Services segment.\nThe results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments, or segment earnings. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level.

These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our standalone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.\nIn addition, the Retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season.\nOur Group and Specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of Medicare stand-alone PDP in the Retail segment, with the Group and Specialty segment's benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.\nHighlights\n\u2022Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets.

In addition, the 2021 period results reflect the impact of lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response effort, the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely and charitable contribution cost to support the communities served by us. Combined, the COVID-19 impacts described previously resulted in lower operating results in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\u25e6Partially offsetting the COVID-19 financial headwind that we experienced in 2021, our results of operations for 2021 were favorably impacted by individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contract membership growth and improved operating performance in our Healthcare Services segment, including the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home in August 2021. Further, 2021 was also favorably impacted by the lower tax rate resulting from the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share, primarily reflecting share repurchases.\nHealth Care Reform\nThe Health Care Reform Law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. The annual health insurance\nindustry fee, which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate, was in effect for calendar year 2020 and permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.\nIt is reasonably possible that the Health Care Reform Law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes such as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the \"Families First Act\"), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to COVID-19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.\nWe intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and home services, to our Retail and Group and Specialty segment customers and are described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operations for 2021 and 2020\nCertain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and

amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income.\nPremiums Revenue\nConsolidated premiums increased $5.6 billion, or 7.6%, from $74.2 billion in the 2020 period to $79.8 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher premium revenues from Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth, higher per member Medicare Advantage premiums as a result of the improving CMS benchmark rate for 2021, net of Medicare Risk Adjustment (MRA) headwinds resulting from COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020, as well as the additional quarter impact of Medicare sequestration relief in 2021 that was not enacted until the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by declining stand-alone PDP, group commercial medical, and group Medicare Advantage membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off.\nServices Revenue\nConsolidated services revenue increased $1.2 billion, or 68.3%, from $1.8 billion in the 2020 period to $3.1 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher home solutions revenues associated with consolidation of Kindred at Home earnings.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income decreased $967 million, or 83.8%, from $1.2 billion in the 2020 period to $187 million in the 2021 period primarily due to a significant decrease in the fair value of our publicly-traded equity securities investments.\nBenefits Expense\nConsolidated benefits expense increased $7.6 billion, or 12.3%, from $61.6 billion in the 2020 period to $69.2 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 360 basis points from 83.1% in the 2020 period to 86.7% in the 2021 period. These increases reflect the termination in 2021 of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee which, along with a portion of the related tax benefit, was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, and COVID-19 impacts, including the impact of the deferral of non-essential care, net of meaningful COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, our pandemic relief efforts in 2020, as well as 2021 MRA headwinds resulting from this COVID-19 related utilization disruption in 2020. The year over year increase further reflects the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off, and the 2021 impact associated with the competitive nature of the group Medicare Advantage business, particularly in large group accounts that were recently procured, as well as in the stand-alone PDP business. These factors were partially offset by higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in 2021.\nThe higher favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns. The suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the 2021 period versus approximately 40 basis points in the 2020 period.\nOperating Costs\nOur segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.\nConsolidated operating costs increased $0.07 billion, or 0.7%, from $10.05 billion in the 2020 period to $10.12 billion in the 2021 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 13.2% in the 2020 period to 12.2% in the 2021 period. The ratio decrease was primarily due to the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment, member response efforts, and the build-out of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely. The decrease was\nfurther impacted by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership, operating cost efficiencies in 2021 from previously implemented productivity initiatives, as well as the impact of a $200 million contribution to the Humana Foundation in the first half of 2020 to support communities served by the Company, particularly those with social and health disparities. These factors were partially offset by the consolidation of Kindred at Home operations as the business has a significantly higher operating cost ratio than our historical consolidated operating cost ratio, continued strategic and technology modernization investments made to position us for long-term success, transaction and integration costs associated with the Kindred at Home transaction, as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in the 2020 period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $107 million, or 21.9%, from $489 million in the 2020 period to $596 million in the 2021 period primarily due to capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $43 million, or 15.2%, from $283 million in the 2020 period to $326 million in the 2021 period from borrowings to fund the KAH acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate during 2021 was 14.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 28.0% in 2020. The change was primarily due to the non-taxable gain we recognized on our previously held Kindred at Home equity method investment from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the business in August 2021 and the termination of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2021. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.\nRetail Segment\n "}
