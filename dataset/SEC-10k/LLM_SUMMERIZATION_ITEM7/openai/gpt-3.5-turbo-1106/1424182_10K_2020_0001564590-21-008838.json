This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio has grown to 640 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada, with an aggregate gross asset value of approximately $4.0 billion.\nWe focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants' businesses and for which there are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases. Through long-term net leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund their core business operations rather than real estate ownership.\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Diversified Portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio comprised approximately 28.2 million rentable square feet of operational space, and was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and is cross-diversified within each (e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration):\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Property Type: We are focused primarily on industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types based on our extensive experience in and conviction around these sectors.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and U.S. states, including the areas in which we operate, adopted certain measures to mitigate the ongoing public health crises. Such measures included shelter in place\u201d or stay at home\u201d rules, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate in many countries and U.S. states. Although such restrictions have been or were in the process of being lifted in various locations, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases has led to a reinstatement or partial reinstatement of restrictions in some locations. We cannot predict whether and to what extent additional states and cities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown.\nThe sections below summarize the typical factors that impact our results of operations, including the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, during the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as management's view of potential impacts on our future results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For more discussion on the risks associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nFactors That Impact Our Result of Operations\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that typically impact our results of operations and financial condition, which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, include rental rates and collections, property dispositions, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition activity, net lease terms, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, tenant bankruptcies, and impairments.\nRental Rates and Collections\nOur financial results depend on our ability to timely collect contractual rents due under our long-term net leases. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on us has primarily manifested through tenant requests for rent relief. In total, we granted partial rent relief requests to 15 tenants related to 93 properties.\nWe evaluated each request for rent relief as a unique situation, employing a rigorous credit and business analysis focusing on, among other things, industry circumstances, the tenant's financial performance, liquidity position, lease structure, and geographic location, and regulatory impacts on the tenant's operations (e.g., stay-at-home orders, essential v. nonessential business designations). Based on our analyses, we granted relief on a select basis only to those tenants we determined to be most in need. In cases where we granted rent relief, we focused on negotiating the shortest possible repayment period and, when possible, lease enhancements (e.g. extensions of term). There were several tenants who requested rent relief that we believed were well positioned to continue making rent payments during the pandemic. Many of those tenants had strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, had applied for or received Paycheck Protection Program loan funding under the CARES Act, or were designated as essential businesses and could continue to operate despite restrictions on other businesses. We declined to agree to any rent relief in those circumstances, and in all such cases the tenants continued to pay all rents due as of December 31, 2020.\nThe rent relief requests we granted included partial deferral of payment of rent with 14 tenants, and a partial abatement of rent with one tenant. As of December 31, 2020, all deferral periods have ended, and the balance of rent deferrals yet to be repaid was less than $1 million. The abatement period ended subsequent to year-end in January 2021.\nIn circumstances where we agreed to a rent deferral that is to be repaid over a period of time, and where the terms of the lease and amounts paid under the lease were substantially the same, we continued to recognize the same amount of GAAP lease revenue each period to the extent the amounts were probable of collection. The amounts we agreed to defer impacted our cash flows from operations.\nThe following chart summarizes our 2020 rent collections:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Received\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Abated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncollected Rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDespite our continued strong rent collections subsequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the potential ongoing impacts of the virus on our tenants' ability to conduct their business should additional governmental restrictions be implemented, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to continue to collect future rents.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we strategically dispose of properties, primarily when we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on dispositions may materially impact our operating results, and the recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in real estate transactions and weakening market conditions for several property types resulting from an increase in vacant rental space. Although we were able to dispose of properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 at advantageous prices, in the short term, the slowdown in market activity may inhibit our ability to further dispose of properties we have identified for disposition, including those leased by tenants that experience significant credit deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price at which we are able to sell the properties may be negatively impacted. We will continue to monitor the pandemic's impact and continue to selectively dispose of properties when advantageous to do so.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2020, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our portfolio was approximately 10.7 years, excluding renewal options, and approximately 10.2% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2026. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant and are not subject to a lease, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could\nnegatively impact our operating results. Our occupancy rates have remained strong during the COVID-19 pandemic, standing at 99.2% as of December 31, 2020 based on rentable square footage. Additionally, when negotiating COVID-19 related rent relief agreements, we have sought to extend lease terms where possible to preserve the continuity of tenants and long-term cash flows derived from our portfolio. While we believe our portfolio's diversity should allow us to manage the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on lease renewals and occupancy, we continue to monitor the pandemic's effects on several industries in which our tenants operate, such as bankruptcies by large retailers, continued or increased occupancy limits established by local governments on the casual dining industry, as well as the potential long-term effects on the demand for and utilization of office space as more companies consider adopting work from home models.\nAcquisition Activity\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a slowdown in acquisition volume, and we did not acquire any new properties during the first ten months of 2020. We returned to growth through acquisitions during the fourth quarter, investing $100.3 million excluding capitalized acquisition expenses in 19 properties at a weighted average initial capitalization rate of 6.9%.\nWe continue to build and evaluate a robust pipeline of potential investment opportunities, predominantly focused on industrial, healthcare, quick-service restaurant, and select retail property sectors.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require that we pay some or all of the property expenses such as roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, the cost of environmental liabilities, if any, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2020, master leases contributed approximately 34.4% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.0% of our restaurant property ABR (168 of our 247 restaurant properties), and 47.2% of our retail property ABR (76 of our 130 retail properties).\nIn instances in which we granted rent relief, we generally preserved the rights afforded to us pursuant to our leases. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents certain risks of modifications to our lease terms, including certain rights we have under master leases. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could also increase the risk of tenants' failure to meet their lease obligations, including the risk that the prolonged economic downturn forces tenants into bankruptcy. An increase in the number of leases under which we are responsible for some or all property related expenses could negatively influence our operating results.\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt. In January 2021, we received an initial credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from S&P, which will have the effect of lowering the applicable margin on our existing $965 million of bank loans by 25 basis points beginning in February 2021, as well as a 20 basis point decrease in the applicable margin on future Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. However, a downgrade in our credit rating could also increase the amount of interest we pay under our debt agreements.\nInterest rates declined during 2020 as the U.S. federal government attempts to combat the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We benefited from this dynamic to the extent our floating rate borrowings were unhedged. Such borrowings bear interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating. The one-month LIBOR rate decreased from 1.76% at December 31, 2019, to 0.14% at December 31, 2020. We repaid $456.3 million of unhedged borrowings with the proceeds of our IPO, and approximately $110.0 million of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020, remained unhedged. Restrictions in credit markets resulted in increased borrowing spreads across the debt capital markets earlier in the year as compared to the end of 2019,\nalthough they have since narrowed. As market conditions evolve and we return to executing against our growth strategy, additional changes in interest rates and our borrowing spreads could influence our operating results.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and related costs, third party legal, accounting, and consulting expenses, travel and entertainment, and general office expenses. Since March 16, 2020, we have been primarily operating under a work from home policy. As of the date of this filing, the policy remains in effect. Given our limited headcount, we have not incurred a material amount of cash outlays on information technology or infrastructure to facilitate our remote workforce, and do not believe we will incur significant costs in the future. We have experienced a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, as social distancing guidelines and restrictions have limited corporate travel. These benefits, however, may be outweighed by incremental third party legal, accounting, and consulting costs if the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenants and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our financial results. We have yet to see the long-term effects of the pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future. A prolonged exposure to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic may result in additional tenant bankruptcies.\nImpairments\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. Significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above, changes in the future, we may have to recognize an impairment. Indications of a tenant's inability to continue as a going concern, changes in our view or strategy relative to a tenant's business or industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in our long-term hold strategies, could each be indicative of an impairment triggering event. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment charges, mainly resulting from changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties, which was due in part to unfavorable market trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where we have vacant properties being marketed for re-lease or sale. We face the risk of additional impairments depending on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the full extent of expected direct compensation expense associated with employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In 2019, we significantly increased the size of our portfolio, adding 74 new properties at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. Our acquisitions were largely weighted towards the second half of the year, with the closing of a $735.7 million industrial and office portfolio in August 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 99.2% occupied (based on rentable square footage), with ABR weighted average annual rent increases of 2.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $100.3 million, excluding capitalized acquisition costs, in 19 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.9%. Most of these acquisitions closed during the month of December, and therefore did not contribute meaningfully to the increase in Lease revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,981\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of investment in\nrental properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above. The amount of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue fluctuates period-over-period based on the composition of our property acquisitions each year. We allocate the purchase price of these acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which have differing useful lives impacting the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized thereafter. The assets generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Our acquisitions and strategic growth strategies have not resulted in meaningful trends in the composition of underlying assets acquired.\nAsset management fees and Property management fees\nThe decline in asset management fees and property management fees was due to the completion of the Internalization. Upon completion of the Internalization, the agreements with the third-party manager were terminated, resulting in a decrease in these expenses as compared to the prior year period.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues, net.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses mainly reflects the impact of the Internalization associated with our newly acquired employee base. Following the Internalization, our asset and property management fees were replaced with compensation and related expenses, which totaled $16.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, along with associated general and administrative expenses. In 2020, we achieved costs savings from our internalized structure, as the increase in general and administrative expenses is less than the combined decrease in asset management, property management, and disposition fees incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 under our prior externally managed structure.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties, compared to $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The following table presents the impairment charges for their respective periods:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except number of properties)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrying value prior to impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing and amount of impairment fluctuates from period to period depending on the specific facts and circumstances. We took a majority of the 2020 impairment during the third quarter, which primarily related to an increased likelihood that we would sell an asset that was vacated through a tenant's bankruptcy. We continued to market the asset for lease or sale, and subsequent to year end, we signed a long-term lease with a new tenant.\nOther income (expenses)\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,176\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,929\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internalization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,658\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of earnout liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nIncreased interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects increased average outstanding borrowings in the comparable period. We incurred incremental revolver and term loan borrowings in August 2019 to fund a significant acquisition and in February 2020 in connection with the Internalization. These borrowings were unhedged and bore interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, which decreased from 1.76% at December 31, 2019 to 0.14% at December 31, 2020. As a result, we benefited from declining interest rates during the period of time they were outstanding. The borrowings were fully repaid in September 2020 with proceeds from our IPO.\nGain on sale of real estate\nOur recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized gains of $15.0 million on the sale of 24 properties, compared to gains of $29.9 million on the sale of 49 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019. There was an increase in the sale of properties during 2019 as a result of our deleveraging plans following the significant industrial and office portfolio acquisition in August 2019. The decrease in the sale of properties during 2020 was a result of a shift in our deleveraging to employ proceeds from the IPO, rather than gains on sales of properties, to reduce leverage, as well as a general decrease in market activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nIncome taxes\nThe decrease in Income taxes during 2020 is mainly attributable to federal and state taxes paid in 2019 by our Taxable REIT Subsidiary as a result of our deleveraging plans subsequent to our significant industrial and office portfolio acquisition in August 2019.\nChange in fair value of earnout liability\nAs part of the Internalization we may be required to pay additional earnout consideration if certain milestones are achieved during the Earnout Periods. During 2020, we recorded the fair value of this contingent consideration in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and updated the fair value at the end of each reporting period. To the extent the change in fair value relates to a portion of the earnout consideration that is classified as a liability, we record the change through earnings. We estimate the fair value of the earnout liability by considering weighted-average probabilities of likely outcomes, and using a Monte Carlo simulation and discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value. These estimates require the Company to make various assumptions about future share prices, and other items that are unobservable and are considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The change in the fair value of the earnout liability during the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects changes in share prices and our peer stock price volatility assumption, which are attributable to changes in economic circumstances impacting global equity markets.\nNet Income and Net earnings per diluted share\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,838\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.39\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, is primarily due to a $23.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $15.6 million increase in impairment charges, a $14.9 million decrease in gains on sale of real estate, and a $3.6 million increase in interest expense. These factors were partially offset by revenue growth of $22.8 million and $1.8 million of income from the decrease in the fair value of our earnout liability in 2020 with no comparable adjustment in the prior year. In addition, as a result of the Internalization, increased general and administrative expenses of $22.5 million were offset by $26.4 million lower asset management and property management fees.\nGAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-over-period comparisons. These fluctuations, combined with the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the common shares and OP Units issued in conjunction with the IPO and Internalization, contributed to the $0.39 decrease in net earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe acquire real estate using a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders. Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage strategy has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our investment grade credit rating of Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service ( Moody's\u201d), which was reaffirmed in July 2020, and our initial credit rating of BBB from S&P in January 2021. We manage our leverage profile using a ratio of Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe is a useful measure of our ability to repay debt and a relative measure of leverage, and is used in communications with lenders and with rating agencies regarding our credit rating. We seek to maintain on a sustained basis a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio that is generally less than 6.0x. As of December 31, 2020, we had total debt outstanding of $1.5 billion, Net Debt of $1.4 billion, and a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of approximately 5.15x.\nNet Debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is calculated based upon EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, each of which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures below for further details concerning our calculation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measure.\nLiquidity/REIT Requirements\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our long-term liquidity needs, including repayment of debt and the acquisition of additional properties, from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt, and to pay distributions. We do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs because of the strong occupancy levels across our portfolio and the nature of our leases. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances and net cash provided by operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. Debt capital is provided through unsecured term notes, revolving credit facilities, and senior unsecured notes. Further, we anticipate having the ability to access the public unsecured bond market, which was historically largely unavailable to us.\nThe source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio's lease terms, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property. Mortgages, however, are not currently a strategic focus of the active management of our capital structure.\nEquity Capital Resources\nOn September 21, 2020, we completed our IPO and issued 37 million shares of stock for net proceeds of $588.3 million, including shares issued subsequently pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option. We used $216.5 million of the net proceeds to fully repay the outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under our then existing revolving credit agreement and $240.2 million of the proceeds to fully repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest associated with an unsecured term loan.\nAs we deploy our net proceeds from our successful IPO and continue to invest in accretive real estate properties, we expect to continue to balance our debt and equity capitalization, while maintaining a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio below 6.0x on a sustained basis, through the anticipated use of follow-on equity offerings and an at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) program.\nPrior to the IPO, equity capital for our real estate acquisition activity was provided by proceeds from our private offering, including distributions reinvested through our DRIP. We suspended our private offering on January 10, 2020, and did not raise any equity through our private offering during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we raised approximately $5.9 million in equity capital through our DRIP. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $394.4 million in equity capital, of which $329.8 million was received through new cash investments and $64.6 million was raised through our DRIP. We announced on January 10, 2020 that we were terminating our DRIP effective February 10, 2020.\nUnsecured Indebtedness\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, unsecured term loans and Senior Notes at December 31, 2020.\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands, except interest rates)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\nDate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Sept. 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Feb. 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jan. 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jun. 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2026 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Feb. 2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Apr. 2027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.09%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2028\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2030\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,440,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn connection with our IPO in September 2020, we replaced our prior $600.0 million revolving credit facility with a $900.0 million Revolving Credit Facility that includes $20.0 million available for issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maturity date of September 2023 and provides for two six-month extensions, at our election, subject to certain conditions set forth in the agreement and payment of a 0.0625% fee on the revolving commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an applicable facility fee ranging between 0.125% and 0.30% per annum, based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2020, the facility fee was 0.25% per annum based on our credit rating of Baa3 on such date.\nBorrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.825% and 1.55% per annum. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin was 1.20% based on our credit rating on such date.\n2022 Unsecured Term Loan\nWe entered into the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan to partially repay BRE debt that we assumed as part of the Internalization. Borrowings under the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest only payments at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating, ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin was 1.25% based on our credit rating on such date.\n2023 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2023 Unsecured Term loan has an initial maturity date of January 2023. Borrowings under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.90% and 1.75% per annum. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin was 1.35% based on our credit rating on such date.\n2024 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2024 Unsecured Term Loan has an initial maturity date of June 2024. Borrowings under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin was 1.25% based on our credit rating on such date.\n2026 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2026 Unsecured Term Loan includes an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the facility size up to a total of $550 million of available capacity. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan are payable interest only on a monthly basis during the term of the loan, with the principal amount due in February 2026. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term loan bear\ninterest equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 1.45% and 2.40% per annum. At December 31, 2020, the applicable margin was 1.85% based on our credit rating on such date.\nSenior Notes\nTo mitigate interest rate risk and extend the tenor of a portion of our debt, we have strategically added unsecured, fixed-rate, interest-only senior promissory notes ( Senior Notes\u201d) to our capital structure. The Senior Notes were issued in three series (Series A, B, and C) as described below.\nSeries A Notes\nThe Series A Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.84% per annum, and mature on April 18, 2027.\nSeries B and Series C Notes\nThe Series B and Series C Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, and bear interest at fixed rates of 5.09% per annum and 5.19% per annum, respectively. The Series B Notes mature on July 2, 2028, and the Series C Notes mature on July 2, 2030.\nDebt Covenants\nWe are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities, which are summarized below. As of December 31, 2020, we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants on all outstanding borrowings. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Requirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Indebtedness Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.40 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unencumbered Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Unsecured Indebtedness to Total Unencumbered Eligible Property Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and Other Restricted Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Only applicable in case of default\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating-rate borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities and a certain mortgage. Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities and the mortgage bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.\nWe attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2020, we had 33 interest rate swaps outstanding in an aggregate notional amount of $859.8 million. Under these agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value.

The increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflected increased outflows for the acquisition of properties, most notably a significant acquisition during August 2019. In addition, during the 2018 period, we received $18.5 million from the sale of our investment in preferred units of BRE, with no such cash inflow in 2019. These factors were somewhat offset by increased proceeds from the disposal of properties as we actively manage our balance sheet following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition.\nThe change in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly reflects a net repayment of debt in 2020 with proceeds from our IPO, compared to net borrowings in 2019 that were partially offset by increased proceeds from the sale of common stock. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly reflects net incremental borrowings and increased proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which were used to fund the increased acquisition activity, partially offset by increased distributions resulting from an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> Year of\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revolving Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Senior\nNotes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgages\nand Notes\nPayable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nExpense(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tenant\nImprovement\nAllowances(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\nLeases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,066,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 965,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 360,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,914,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We may extend the Revolving Credit Facility twice, each for a six-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% of the revolving commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020.

The tax protection agreements require us to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, or in the case of the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. Based on values as of December 31, 2020, taxable sales of the applicable properties would trigger liability under the four agreements of approximately $22.3 million. Based on information available, we do not believe that the events resulting in damages as\ndetailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have excluded these commitments from the contractual commitments table above.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nFFO and AFFO\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash and non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, the change in fair value of our earnout liability, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, internalization expenses, stock-based compensation, severance, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors.\nOur leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rentals over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. In situations where we granted short-term rent deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and such deferrals were probable of collection and expected to be repaid within a short term, we continued to recognize the same amount of GAAP lease revenues each period. Consistent with GAAP lease revenues, the short-term deferrals associated with COVID-19 did not impact our AFFO.\nWe further exclude the change in fair value of our earnout liability, costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, internalization expenses, stock-based compensation and severance, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful.\nNeither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly.\nThe following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry. We believe that this ratio provides investors and analysts with a measure of our performance that includes our operating results unaffected by the differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets compared to other companies in our industry. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit, as EBITDA excluding gains (loss) from the sales of depreciable property and provisions for impairment on investment in real estate. We believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information about our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe are focused on a disciplined and targeted acquisition strategy, together with active asset management that includes selective sales of properties. We manage our leverage profile using a ratio of Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, each discussed further below, which we believe is a useful measure of our ability to repay debt and a relative measure of leverage, and is used in communications with our lenders and rating agencies regarding our credit rating. As we fund new acquisitions using our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, our leverage profile and Net Debt will be immediately impacted by current quarter acquisitions. However, the full benefit of EBITDAre from newly acquired properties will not be received in the same quarter in which the properties are acquired. Additionally, EBITDAre for the quarter includes amounts generated by properties that have been sold during the quarter. Accordingly, the variability in EBITDAre caused by the timing of our acquisitions and dispositions can temporarily distort our leverage ratios. We adjust EBITDAre ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d) for the most recently completed quarter (i) to recalculate as if all acquisitions and dispositions had occurred at the beginning of the quarter, (ii) to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that are either non-cash, such as cost of debt extinguishments or the change in fair value of our earnout liability, or that we believe are one time, or unusual in nature because they relate to unique circumstances or transactions that had not previously occurred and which we do not anticipate occurring in the future, and (iii) to eliminate the impact of lease termination fees and other items that are not a result of normal operations. We then annualize quarterly Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying it by four ( Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are not measurements of performance under GAAP, and our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in Rental Property\nRental property accounted for under operating leases is recorded at cost. Rental property accounted for under direct financing leases and sales-type are recorded at its net investment, which generally represents the cost of the property at the inception of the lease.\nWe account for acquisitions of real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, as substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as asset acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized and included with the allocated purchase price. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and our marketing and leasing activities. Factors that impact our fair value determination include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. Changes in any of these factors could impact the future purchase prices of our investments and the corresponding capitalization rates recognized. We do not believe the assumptions used to fair value the investments upon acquisition have a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.\nThe estimated fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The as-if-vacant value is then allocated to land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property, as estimated by management. Specifically, the if vacant\u201d value of buildings and\nequipment is calculated using an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to value the buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and land improvement value.\nThe estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases are the costs we would have had to incur to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such costs include the fair value of leasing commissions and other operating costs that would have been incurred to lease the properties, had they been vacant, to their acquired occupancy level. Acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition are amortized over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms of the respective leases to amortization expense.\nAcquired above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases.\nShould a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value is charged to amortization expense and the unamortized portion of above-market or below-market lease value is charged to rental income.\nManagement estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages and notes payable based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. Assumed mortgages and notes payable are initially recorded at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the difference between such estimated fair value and the notes' outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.\nExpenditures for significant betterments and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Construction and improvement costs incurred in connection with the development of new properties or the redevelopment of existing properties are capitalized. Real estate taxes, interest costs, and leasing and development costs incurred during construction periods are capitalized. Capitalization is based on qualified expenditures and interest rates. Capitalized real estate taxes, interest costs, and leasing and development costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the related assets. There were no capitalized interest or real estate taxes during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nWe review long-lived assets, other than goodwill, to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. A significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. Management's impairment assessment as of December 31, 2020 was based on the most current information available. Based upon current market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our properties may have fair values less than their carrying amounts. However, based on management's plans with respect to each of those properties, we believe that their carrying amounts are recoverable and therefore, under applicable GAAP guidance, no impairment charges were recognized other than those described below. If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if our expected holding period for assets changes, subsequent tests for impairments could result in additional impairment charges in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges associated with seven properties. Impairment indicators included changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties, which was due in part to unfavorable market trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where we have vacant properties being marketed for re-lease or sale.\nInputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through the use of published commercial real estate market information. We determine the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of real estate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded impairment charges of $19.1 million, $3.5 million, and $2.1 million, respectively.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amount paid over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and it assigned to one or more reporting units. We evaluate goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, or at least annually. Our annual testing date is November 30.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If a qualitative approach indicates it is more likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative approach, we perform the quantitative approach described below.\nWhen we perform a quantitative test of goodwill for impairment, we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit with its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not consider goodwill to be impaired and no further analysis would be required. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, the amount of goodwill impairment equals the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nManagement determined that we have one reporting unit, consistent with our segment reporting analysis, which includes the acquisition, leasing, and ownership of net leased properties (i.e., the consolidated entity). When necessary to perform the quantitative test for goodwill impairment, our estimate of fair value is determined using a market approach, leveraging assumptions such as the fair value of our equity, and consideration of a control premium, if necessary, which includes an analysis of similar market transactions. While we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test on November 30, 2020, our inaugural goodwill impairment test date, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. We commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors, including the initial determination that the contract is or contains a lease. Generally, all of our property related contracts are or contain leases, and therefore revenue is recognized when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased assets. In most instances this occurs on the lease commencement date. At the time of lease assumption or at the inception of a new lease, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions of the lease to determine the proper lease classification.\nCertain of our leases require tenants to pay rent based upon a percentage of the property's net sales ( percentage rent\u201d) or contain rent escalators indexed to future changes in the CPI. Lease income associated with such provisions is considered variable lease income and therefore is not included in the initial measurement of the lease receivable, or in the calculation of straight-line rent revenue. Such amounts are recognized as income when the amounts are determinable.\nA lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably expected to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the economic life of the leased property, (iv) the present value of the future lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property, and (v) the leased property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no future alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term. If one or more of these criteria are met, the lease will generally be classified as a sales-type lease, unless the lease contains a residual value guarantee from a third party other than the lessee, in which case it would be classified as a direct financing lease under certain circumstances.\nWe account for the right to use land as a separate lease component, unless the accounting effect of doing so would be insignificant. Determination of significance requires management judgment. In determining whether the accounting effect of separately reporting the land component from other components for its real estate leases is significant, we assess: (i) whether separating the land component impacts\nthe classification of any lease component, (ii) the value of the land component in the context of the overall contract, and (iii) whether the right to use the land is coterminous with the rights to use the other assets.\nRevenue recognition methods for operating leases, direct financing leases, and sales-type leases are described below:\nRental property accounted for under operating leases - Revenue is recognized as rents are earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, and the collectability of the lease payment is probable, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded as Accrued rental income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If we determine that collectability of the lease payments is not probable, we record an adjustment to Lease revenues, net to reduce cumulative income recognized since lease commencement to the amount of cash collected from the lessee. Future revenue recognition is limited to amounts paid by the lessee.\nRental property accounted for under direct financing leases - We utilize the direct finance method of accounting to record direct financing lease income. The net investment in the direct financing lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments to be received and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unamortized unearned income (which represents the difference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows). Unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on our net investment in the leases.\nRental property accounted for under sales-type leases - For leases accounted for as sales-type leases, we record selling profit arising from the lease at inception, along with the net investment in the lease. We lease assets through the assumption of existing leases or through sale-leaseback transactions, and records such assets at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which in most cases coincides with lease inception. As a result, we do not generally recognize selling profit on sales-type leases. The net investment in the sales-type lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased property, each measured at net present value. Interest income is recorded over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on our net investment in the leases.\nCertain of our lease contracts contain nonlease components (e.g., charges for management fees, common area maintenance, and reimbursement of third-party maintenance expenses) in addition to lease components (i.e., monthly rental charges). Services related to nonlease components are provided over the same period of time as, and billed in the same manner as, monthly rental charges. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient available under ASC 842, for all classes of assets, not to separate the lease components from the nonlease components when accounting for operating leases. Since the lease component is the predominant component under each of these leases, combined revenues from both the lease and nonlease components are reported as Lease revenues, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nManagement uses interest rate swap agreements to manage risks related to interest rate movements. The interest rate swap agreements, designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, are reported at fair value.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, we present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. The gain or loss on the qualifying hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments (the forecasted transactions) on the related debt are incurred and as the swap net settlements occur.\nWhen an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method, which approximates an effective interest method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the period the cash flow hedge is terminated.\nManagement documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge. Our interest rate risk management strategy is intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see the captions Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio has grown to 640 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada, with an aggregate gross asset value of approximately $4.0 billion.\nWe focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants' businesses and for which there are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases. Through long-term net leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund their core business operations rather than real estate ownership.\n - Diversified Portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio comprised approximately 28.2 million rentable square feet of operational space, and was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and is cross-diversified within each (e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration): \n o Property Type: We are focused primarily on industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types based on our extensive experience in and conviction around these sectors. Within these sectors, we have meaningful concentrations in manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, clinical, casual dining, quick service restaurant, strategic operations, corporate headquarters, food processing, flex/research and development, and cold storage. \n o Geographic Diversity: Our properties are located in 41 U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada, with no single geographic concentration exceeding 10.2% of our ABR. \n o Tenant and Industry Diversity: Our properties are occupied by approximately 181 different commercial tenants who operate 167 different brands that are diversified across 55 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.5% of our ABR. \n - Strong In-Place Leases with Significant Remaining Lease Term. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was approximately 99.2% leased based on rentable square footage with an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10.7 years, excluding renewal options. \n - Standard Contractual Base Rent Escalation. Approximately 98.3% of our leases have contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1%. \n - Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting. Approximately 88.7% of our ABR is received from tenants that are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis. An additional 6.3% of our ABR is received from tenants who are not required to provide us with specified financial information under the terms of our lease, but whose financial statements are available publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in deep economic uncertainty and far-reaching impacts on almost every business and industry, including industries in which our tenants operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and U.S. states, including the areas in which we operate, adopted certain measures to mitigate the ongoing public health crises. Such measures included shelter in place\u201d or stay at home\u201d rules, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate in many countries and U.S. states. Although such restrictions have been or were in the process of being lifted in various locations, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases has led to a reinstatement or partial reinstatement of restrictions in some locations. We cannot predict whether and to what extent additional states and cities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown.\nThe sections below summarize the typical factors that impact our results of operations, including the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, during the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as management's view of potential impacts on our future results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For more discussion on the risks associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nFactors That Impact Our Result of Operations\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that typically impact our results of operations and financial condition, which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, include rental rates and collections, property dispositions, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition activity, net lease terms, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, tenant bankruptcies, and impairments.\nRental Rates and Collections\nOur financial results depend on our ability to timely collect contractual rents due under our long-term net leases. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on us has primarily manifested through tenant requests for rent relief. In total, we granted partial rent relief requests to 15 tenants related to 93 properties.\nWe evaluated each request for rent relief as a unique situation, employing a rigorous credit and business analysis focusing on, among other things, industry circumstances, the tenant's financial performance, liquidity position, lease structure, and geographic location, and regulatory impacts on the tenant's operations (e.g., stay-at-home orders, essential v. nonessential business designations). Based on our analyses, we granted relief on a select basis only to those tenants we determined to be most in need. In cases where we granted rent relief, we focused on negotiating the shortest possible repayment period and, when possible, lease enhancements (e.g. extensions of term). There were several tenants who requested rent relief that we believed were well positioned to continue making rent payments during the pandemic. Many of those tenants had strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, had applied for or received Paycheck Protection Program loan funding under the CARES Act, or were designated as essential businesses and could continue to operate despite restrictions on other businesses. We declined to agree to any rent relief in those circumstances, and in all such cases the tenants continued to pay all rents due as of December 31, 2020.\nThe rent relief requests we granted included partial deferral of payment of rent with 14 tenants, and a partial abatement of rent with one tenant. As of December 31, 2020, all deferral periods have ended, and the balance of rent deferrals yet to be repaid was less than $1 million. The abatement period ended subsequent to year-end in January 2021.\nIn circumstances where we agreed to a rent deferral that is to be repaid over a period of time, and where the terms of the lease and amounts paid under the lease were substantially the same, we continued to recognize the same amount of GAAP lease revenue each period to the extent the amounts were probable of collection. The amounts we agreed to defer impacted our cash flows from operations.\nThe following chart summarizes our 2020 rent collections:\n\nDespite our continued strong rent collections subsequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the potential ongoing impacts of the virus on our tenants' ability to conduct their business should additional governmental restrictions be implemented, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to continue to collect future rents.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we strategically dispose of properties, primarily when we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on dispositions may materially impact our operating results, and the recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in real estate transactions and weakening market conditions for several property types resulting from an increase in vacant rental space. Although we were able to dispose of properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 at advantageous prices, in the short term, the slowdown in market activity may inhibit our ability to further dispose of properties we have identified for disposition, including those leased by tenants that experience significant credit deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price at which we are able to sell the properties may be negatively impacted. We will continue to monitor the pandemic's impact and continue to selectively dispose of properties when advantageous to do so.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2020, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our portfolio was approximately 10.7 years, excluding renewal options, and approximately 10.2% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2026. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant and are not subject to a lease, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could\nnegatively impact our operating results. Our occupancy rates have remained strong during the COVID-19 pandemic, standing at 99.2% as of December 31, 2020 based on rentable square footage. Additionally, when negotiating COVID-19 related rent relief agreements, we have sought to extend lease terms where possible to preserve the continuity of tenants and long-term cash flows derived from our portfolio. While we believe our portfolio's diversity should allow us to manage the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on lease renewals and occupancy, we continue to monitor the pandemic's effects on several industries in which our tenants operate, such as bankruptcies by large retailers, continued or increased occupancy limits established by local governments on the casual dining industry, as well as the potential long-term effects on the demand for and utilization of office space as more companies consider adopting work from home models.\nAcquisition Activity\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a slowdown in acquisition volume, and we did not acquire any new properties during the first ten months of 2020. We returned to growth through acquisitions during the fourth quarter, investing $100.3 million excluding capitalized acquisition expenses in 19 properties at a weighted average initial capitalization rate of 6.9%.\nWe continue to build and evaluate a robust pipeline of potential investment opportunities, predominantly focused on industrial, healthcare, quick-service restaurant, and select retail property sectors.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require that we pay some or all of the property expenses such as roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, the cost of environmental liabilities, if any, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2020, master leases contributed approximately 34.4% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.0% of our restaurant property ABR (168 of our 247 restaurant properties), and 47.2% of our retail property ABR (76 of our 130 retail properties).\nIn instances in which we granted rent relief, we generally preserved the rights afforded to us pursuant to our leases. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents certain risks of modifications to our lease terms, including certain rights we have under master leases. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could also increase the risk of tenants' failure to meet their lease obligations, including the risk that the prolonged economic downturn forces tenants into bankruptcy. An increase in the number of leases under which we are responsible for some or all property related expenses could negatively influence our operating results.\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt. In January 2021, we received an initial credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from S&P, which will have the effect of lowering the applicable margin on our existing $965 million of bank loans by 25 basis points beginning in February 2021, as well as a 20 basis point decrease in the applicable margin on future Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. However, a downgrade in our credit rating could also increase the amount of interest we pay under our debt agreements.\nInterest rates declined during 2020 as the U.S. federal government attempts to combat the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We benefited from this dynamic to the extent our floating rate borrowings were unhedged. Such borrowings bear interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating. The one-month LIBOR rate decreased from 1.76% at December 31, 2019, to 0.14% at December 31, 2020. We repaid $456.3 million of unhedged borrowings with the proceeds of our IPO, and approximately $110.0 million of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020, remained unhedged. Restrictions in credit markets resulted in increased borrowing spreads across the debt capital markets earlier in the year as compared to the end of 2019,\nalthough they have since narrowed. As market conditions evolve and we return to executing against our growth strategy, additional changes in interest rates and our borrowing spreads could influence our operating results.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and related costs, third party legal, accounting, and consulting expenses, travel and entertainment, and general office expenses. Since March 16, 2020, we have been primarily operating under a work from home policy. As of the date of this filing, the policy remains in effect. Given our limited headcount, we have not incurred a material amount of cash outlays on information technology or infrastructure to facilitate our remote workforce, and do not believe we will incur significant costs in the future. We have experienced a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, as social distancing guidelines and restrictions have limited corporate travel. These benefits, however, may be outweighed by incremental third party legal, accounting, and consulting costs if the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenants and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our financial results. We have yet to see the long-term effects of the pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future. A prolonged exposure to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic may result in additional tenant bankruptcies.\nImpairments\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. Significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above, changes in the future, we may have to recognize an impairment. Indications of a tenant's inability to continue as a going concern, changes in our view or strategy relative to a tenant's business or industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in our long-term hold strategies, could each be indicative of an impairment triggering event. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment charges, mainly resulting from changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties, which was due in part to unfavorable market trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where we have vacant properties being marketed for re-lease or sale. We face the risk of additional impairments depending on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the full extent of expected direct compensation expense associated with employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended year ended December 31, 2018.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, our real estate investment portfolio included 640 commercial real estate properties with locations in 41 states and one real estate property located in British Columbia, Canada, and leased to tenants in various industries. All but eight of our properties were subject to a lease as of December 31, 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended year ended December 31, 2019\nLease revenues, net\n\nThe increase in Lease revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to growth in our real estate portfolio through accretive property acquisitions during 2019. In 2019, we significantly increased the size of our portfolio, adding 74 new properties at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. Our acquisitions were largely weighted towards the second half of the year, with the closing of a $735.7 million industrial and office portfolio in August 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 99.2% occupied (based on rentable square footage), with ABR weighted average annual rent increases of 2.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $100.3 million, excluding capitalized acquisition costs, in 19 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.9%. Most of these acquisitions closed during the month of December, and therefore did not contribute meaningfully to the increase in Lease revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\n\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above. The amount of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue fluctuates period-over-period based on the composition of our property acquisitions each year. We allocate the purchase price of these acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which have differing useful lives impacting the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized thereafter. The assets generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Our acquisitions and strategic growth strategies have not resulted in meaningful trends in the composition of underlying assets acquired.\nAsset management fees and Property management fees\nThe decline in asset management fees and property management fees was due to the completion of the Internalization. Upon completion of the Internalization, the agreements with the third-party manager were terminated, resulting in a decrease in these expenses as compared to the prior year period.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues, net.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses mainly reflects the impact of the Internalization associated with our newly acquired employee base. Following the Internalization, our asset and property management fees were replaced with compensation and related expenses, which totaled $16.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, along with associated general and administrative expenses. In 2020, we achieved costs savings from our internalized structure, as the increase in general and administrative expenses is less than the combined decrease in asset management, property management, and disposition fees incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 under our prior externally managed structure.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties, compared to $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The following table presents the impairment charges for their respective periods:\n\nThe timing and amount of impairment fluctuates from period to period depending on the specific facts and circumstances. We took a majority of the 2020 impairment during the third quarter, which primarily related to an increased likelihood that we would sell an asset that was vacated through a tenant's bankruptcy. We continued to market the asset for lease or sale, and subsequent to year end, we signed a long-term lease with a new tenant.\nOther income (expenses)\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,176\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,929\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internalization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio has grown to 640 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada, with an aggregate gross asset value of approximately $4.0 billion.\nWe focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants' businesses and for which there are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases. Through long-term net leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund their core business operations rather than real estate ownership.\n - Diversified Portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio comprised approximately 28.2 million rentable square feet of operational space, and was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and is cross-diversified within each (e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration): \n o Property Type: We are focused primarily on industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types based on our extensive experience in and conviction around these sectors. Within these sectors, we have meaningful concentrations in manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, clinical, casual dining, quick service restaurant, strategic operations, corporate headquarters, food processing, flex/research and development, and cold storage. \n o Geographic Diversity: Our properties are located in 41 U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada, with no single geographic concentration exceeding 10.2% of our ABR. \n o Tenant and Industry Diversity: Our properties are occupied by approximately 181 different commercial tenants who operate 167 different brands that are diversified across 55 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.5% of our ABR. \n - Strong In-Place Leases with Significant Remaining Lease Term. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was approximately 99.2% leased based on rentable square footage with an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10.7 years, excluding renewal options. \n - Standard Contractual Base Rent Escalation. Approximately 98.3% of our leases have contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1%. \n - Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting. Approximately 88.7% of our ABR is received from tenants that are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis. An additional 6.3% of our ABR is received from tenants who are not required to provide us with specified financial information under the terms of our lease, but whose financial statements are available publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in deep economic uncertainty and far-reaching impacts on almost every business and industry, including industries in which our tenants operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and U.S. states, including the areas in which we operate, adopted certain measures to mitigate the ongoing public health crises. Such measures included shelter in place\u201d or stay at home\u201d rules, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate in many countries and U.S. states. Although such restrictions have been or were in the process of being lifted in various locations, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases has led to a reinstatement or partial reinstatement of restrictions in some locations. We cannot predict whether and to what extent additional states and cities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown.\nThe sections below summarize the typical factors that impact our results of operations, including the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, during the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as management's view of potential impacts on our future results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For more discussion on the risks associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nFactors That Impact Our Result of Operations\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that typically impact our results of operations and financial condition, which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, include rental rates and collections, property dispositions, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition activity, net lease terms, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, tenant bankruptcies, and impairments.\nRental Rates and Collections\nOur financial results depend on our ability to timely collect contractual rents due under our long-term net leases. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on us has primarily manifested through tenant requests for rent relief. In total, we granted partial rent relief requests to 15 tenants related to 93 properties.\nWe evaluated each request for rent relief as a unique situation, employing a rigorous credit and business analysis focusing on, among other things, industry circumstances, the tenant's financial performance, liquidity position, lease structure, and geographic location, and regulatory impacts on the tenant's operations (e.g., stay-at-home orders, essential v. nonessential business designations). Based on our analyses, we granted relief on a select basis only to those tenants we determined to be most in need. In cases where we granted rent relief, we focused on negotiating the shortest possible repayment period and, when possible, lease enhancements (e.g. extensions of term). There were several tenants who requested rent relief that we believed were well positioned to continue making rent payments during the pandemic. Many of those tenants had strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, had applied for or received Paycheck Protection Program loan funding under the CARES Act, or were designated as essential businesses and could continue to operate despite restrictions on other businesses. We declined to agree to any rent relief in those circumstances, and in all such cases the tenants continued to pay all rents due as of December 31, 2020.\nThe rent relief requests we granted included partial deferral of payment of rent with 14 tenants, and a partial abatement of rent with one tenant. As of December 31, 2020, all deferral periods have ended, and the balance of rent deferrals yet to be repaid was less than $1 million. The abatement period ended subsequent to year-end in January 2021.\nIn circumstances where we agreed to a rent deferral that is to be repaid over a period of time, and where the terms of the lease and amounts paid under the lease were substantially the same, we continued to recognize the same amount of GAAP lease revenue each period to the extent the amounts were probable of collection. The amounts we agreed to defer impacted our cash flows from operations.\nThe following chart summarizes our 2020 rent collections:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Q1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Received\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Abated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base Rent Deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncollected Rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDespite our continued strong rent collections subsequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the potential ongoing impacts of the virus on our tenants' ability to conduct their business should additional governmental restrictions be implemented, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to continue to collect future rents.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we strategically dispose of properties, primarily when we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on dispositions may materially impact our operating results, and the recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a slowdown in real estate transactions and weakening market conditions for several property types resulting from an increase in vacant rental space. Although we were able to dispose of properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 at advantageous prices, in the short term, the slowdown in market activity may inhibit our ability to further dispose of properties we have identified for disposition, including those leased by tenants that experience significant credit deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price at which we are able to sell the properties may be negatively impacted. We will continue to monitor the pandemic's impact and continue to selectively dispose of properties when advantageous to do so.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2020, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our portfolio was approximately 10.7 years, excluding renewal options, and approximately 10.2% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2026. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant and are not subject to a lease, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could\nnegatively impact our operating results. Our occupancy rates have remained strong during the COVID-19 pandemic, standing at 99.2% as of December 31, 2020 based on rentable square footage. Additionally, when negotiating COVID-19 related rent relief agreements, we have sought to extend lease terms where possible to preserve the continuity of tenants and long-term cash flows derived from our portfolio. While we believe our portfolio's diversity should allow us to manage the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on lease renewals and occupancy, we continue to monitor the pandemic's effects on several industries in which our tenants operate, such as bankruptcies by large retailers, continued or increased occupancy limits established by local governments on the casual dining industry, as well as the potential long-term effects on the demand for and utilization of office space as more companies consider adopting work from home models.\nAcquisition Activity\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a slowdown in acquisition volume, and we did not acquire any new properties during the first ten months of 2020. We returned to growth through acquisitions during the fourth quarter, investing $100.3 million excluding capitalized acquisition expenses in 19 properties at a weighted average initial capitalization rate of 6.9%.\nWe continue to build and evaluate a robust pipeline of potential investment opportunities, predominantly focused on industrial, healthcare, quick-service restaurant, and select retail property sectors.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require that we pay some or all of the property expenses such as roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, the cost of environmental liabilities, if any, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2020, master leases contributed approximately 34.4% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.0% of our restaurant property ABR (168 of our 247 restaurant properties), and 47.2% of our retail property ABR (76 of our 130 retail properties).\nIn instances in which we granted rent relief, we generally preserved the rights afforded to us pursuant to our leases. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents certain risks of modifications to our lease terms, including certain rights we have under master leases. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could also increase the risk of tenants' failure to meet their lease obligations, including the risk that the prolonged economic downturn forces tenants into bankruptcy. An increase in the number of leases under which we are responsible for some or all property related expenses could negatively influence our operating results.\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt. In January 2021, we received an initial credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from S&P, which will have the effect of lowering the applicable margin on our existing $965 million of bank loans by 25 basis points beginning in February 2021, as well as a 20 basis point decrease in the applicable margin on future Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. However, a downgrade in our credit rating could also increase the amount of interest we pay under our debt agreements.\nInterest rates declined during 2020 as the U.S. federal government attempts to combat the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We benefited from this dynamic to the extent our floating rate borrowings were unhedged. Such borrowings bear interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating. The one-month LIBOR rate decreased from 1.76% at December 31, 2019, to 0.14% at December 31, 2020. We repaid $456.3 million of unhedged borrowings with the proceeds of our IPO, and approximately $110.0 million of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020, remained unhedged. Restrictions in credit markets resulted in increased borrowing spreads across the debt capital markets earlier in the year as compared to the end of 2019,\nalthough they have since narrowed. As market conditions evolve and we return to executing against our growth strategy, additional changes in interest rates and our borrowing spreads could influence our operating results.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and related costs, third party legal, accounting, and consulting expenses, travel and entertainment, and general office expenses. Since March 16, 2020, we have been primarily operating under a work from home policy. As of the date of this filing, the policy remains in effect. Given our limited headcount, we have not incurred a material amount of cash outlays on information technology or infrastructure to facilitate our remote workforce, and do not believe we will incur significant costs in the future. We have experienced a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, as social distancing guidelines and restrictions have limited corporate travel. These benefits, however, may be outweighed by incremental third party legal, accounting, and consulting costs if the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenants and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our financial results. We have yet to see the long-term effects of the pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future. A prolonged exposure to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic may result in additional tenant bankruptcies.\nImpairments\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. Significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above, changes in the future, we may have to recognize an impairment. Indications of a tenant's inability to continue as a going concern, changes in our view or strategy relative to a tenant's business or industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in our long-term hold strategies, could each be indicative of an impairment triggering event. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment charges, mainly resulting from changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties, which was due in part to unfavorable market trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where we have vacant properties being marketed for re-lease or sale. We face the risk of additional impairments depending on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the full extent of expected direct compensation expense associated with employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In 2019, we significantly increased the size of our portfolio, adding 74 new properties at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. Our acquisitions were largely weighted towards the second half of the year, with the closing of a $735.7 million industrial and office portfolio in August 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 99.2% occupied (based on rentable square footage), with ABR weighted average annual rent increases of 2.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $100.3 million, excluding capitalized acquisition costs, in 19 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.9%. Most of these acquisitions closed during the month of December, and therefore did not contribute meaningfully to the increase in Lease revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,402\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,981\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of investment in\nrental properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above. The amount of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue fluctuates period-over-period based on the composition of our property acquisitions each year. We allocate the purchase price of these acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which have differing useful lives impacting the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized thereafter. The assets generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Our acquisitions and strategic growth strategies have not resulted in meaningful trends in the composition of underlying assets acquired.\nAsset management fees and Property management fees\nThe decline in asset management fees and property management fees was due to the completion of the Internalization. Upon completion of the Internalization, the agreements with the third-party manager were terminated, resulting in a decrease in these expenses as compared to the prior year period.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues, net.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses mainly reflects the impact of the Internalization associated with our newly acquired employee base. Following the Internalization, our asset and property management fees were replaced with compensation and related expenses, which totaled $16.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, along with associated general and administrative expenses. In 2020, we achieved costs savings from our internalized structure, as the increase in general and administrative expenses is less than the combined decrease in asset management, property management, and disposition fees incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 under our prior externally managed structure.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $19.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties, compared to $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The following table presents the impairment charges for their respective periods:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except number of properties)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrying value prior to impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing and amount of impairment fluctuates from period to period depending on the specific facts and circumstances. We took a majority of the 2020 impairment during the third quarter, which primarily related to an increased likelihood that we would sell an asset that was vacated through a tenant's bankruptcy. We continued to market the asset for lease or sale, and subsequent to year end, we signed a long-term lease with a new tenant.\nOther income (expenses)\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,176\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,929\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internalization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
