MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of Argan, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of January 31, 2018, and the results of their operations for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201c2018 Annual Report\u201d).\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain forward-looking statements. We have made statements in this Item 7 and elsewhere in this 2018 Annual Report that may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d The words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning our expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. Our forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. They are subject to change based upon various factors including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of this 2018 Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBusiness Description\nArgan is a holding company that conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, GPS, APC, SMC and TRC.\nThrough GPS and APC, which together provided 91%, 87% and 94% of consolidated revenues for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including independent power project owners, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. GPS, including its consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), if any, and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the United States and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and piping systems. Through SMC, now conducting business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nOverview\nFiscal 2018 was another year of growth for us.\n\u00b7 Revenues increased 32.3% to $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $675.0 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our overall gross profit amount increased 1.8% to $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $146.7 million for the prior year. However, our overall gross profit percentage decreased to 16.7% for Fiscal 2018 as compared to 21.7% for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Net income attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 2.4% to $72.0 million for Fiscal 2018, or 8.1% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $70.3 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 EBITDA(1) attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 5.0% to $116.1 million for Fiscal 2018, or 13.0% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $110.6 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our international subsidiary, APC, has begun to capitalize on the opportunities foreseen when we acquired this business in Fiscal 2016. During the current year, it was awarded two meaningful construction-type contracts related to power plants in the United Kingdom with a combined contract value in excess of $110 million.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid $1.00 per share in cash dividends during Fiscal 2018. In addition, we announced our intent to declare and pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, starting in the first quarter ending April 30, 2018.\n\u00b7 Our tangible net worth(2) increased by 27.4% to $316.6 million as of January 31, 2018 from $248.5 million as of January 31, 2017.\n\u00b7 Our liquidity, or working capital(3), increased by 27.2% to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\n(1) EBITDA is a measure not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have defined EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (see the presentation of EBITDA for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 on page 37 below).\n(2) We define tangible net worth as our total stockholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net.\n(3) We define working capital as our total current assets less our total current liabilities.\nSince the acquisition of GPS in December 2006, over eleven years ago, we have lead our business through challenging industry economic cycles with the growth in revenues and profitability trending upwards as illustrated below. We have achieved an average annual growth in revenues of 16% per year and an average growth in EBITDA of 32% per year. Note that the amounts in the chart for Net Income and EBITDA below are attributable to the stockholders of Argan, Inc. (dollars in millions).\nThese results could not have been achieved without the operational efforts of our employees, particularly during the last three years. Over this period, their dedication to perform multiple tasks and to overcome many associated hurdles was especially reflected in our successfully achieving peak and post-peak construction activities on four EPC projects while completing two other gas-fired power plant projects. These six EPC projects were most significant to our financial results for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, collectively representing 84%, 83% and 86%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. However, while the remaining four projects are progressing, we increased our estimated costs to complete certain EPC projects primarily due to increased labor and subcontractor costs. The corresponding reduction in the amounts of forecasted gross margins had an unfavorable effect on the gross profit amounts reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the latter half of Fiscal 2018 which caused, in part, our consolidated gross profit percentage to decline.\nWith the remaining four GPS projects discussed above, plus one other, projected to be completed in the year ending January 31, 2019 (\u201cFiscal 2019\u201d), and our project backlog reduced to $379 million as of January 31, 2018, we expect our revenues to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. We do expect to add new EPC projects to our project backlog during Fiscal 2019 as discussed below; however, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect Fiscal 2019 to be a year where we transition from the final stages of our existing projects to the early stages of expected new projects. We are cautiously optimistic that the growth of our consolidated revenues will resume in Fiscal 2020 and continue into the future as we are awarded new construction projects and they mature.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nAt January 31, 2018, our project backlog was $379 million. The following table summarizes our large power plant projects:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> Current Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Facility Size\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FNTP Received(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Scheduled\nCompletion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,040 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CPV Towantic Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Connecticut\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 785 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NTE Kings Mountain Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NTE Middletown Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ohio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TeesREP Biomass Power Station(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Teesside (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> InterGen Spalding OCGT Expansion Project(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Spalding (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exelon West Medway II Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Massachusetts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) FNTP represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\n(2) Project values added to project backlog during Fiscal 2018.\nOur reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Although project backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Despite the new awards that are identified above, the total value of our project backlog has declined significantly during Fiscal 2018 which principally reflects the amounts of revenues earned by GPS due to its performance on the first four projects identified above. These four projects were the most significant drivers of our financial results for Fiscal 2018, which together represented approximately 84% of our consolidated revenues. Revenues for each of these projects will continue to decline over the next several quarters as they progress through the commissioning and start-up stages of their project life-cycles.\nWe believe that the slowdown in new business awards to GPS may relate, at least in part, to uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, the increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and the improvements and decreasing prices in renewable energy storage solutions. These factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be delayed by project owners. Other unfavorable factors may include disappointing energy capacity auctions held during the last couple of years for new power generating assets and the impacts of environmental activism.\nIn Fiscal 2018, we saw approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines develop as hurdles for gas-fired power plant developers. Interstate pipelines require the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), whose members require a quorum to act. The lack of a quorum for a period of six months earlier in Fiscal 2018 left FERC unable to provide approval decisions on major energy projects. New members were appointed and approved, but progress in reducing the number of pending decisions was slow. An increase in the number and fervor of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects has garnered media attention and public skepticism about new pipelines resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nDespite the expected revenues decline for GPS in Fiscal 2019, we are encouraged by the new business awarded to our other operating units since the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, we are cautiously optimistic about GPS. On March 27, 2018, we announced that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina. We expect to add the value of this project, approximately $250 million, to our project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018. Also, GPS has been selected by the owners of several other projects to negotiate EPC service contracts with aggregate potential project value in excess of $1.5 billion (including the value of the plant discussed in the fourth bullet point below) and with projected start dates ranging from later in 2018 through 2019. We have performed certain pre-contract tasks at the request of several of these project owners. Nonetheless, GPS has not received a limited or full notice to proceed on any of the projects discussed in this paragraph, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built. None of these projects were reflected in our project backlog at January 31, 2018. Other significant new business accomplishments during the year ended January 31, 2018 related to the following projects.\n\u00b7 During Fiscal 2018, the owner of a power project located in Medway, Massachusetts provided us with the necessary authorization under the corresponding turnkey EPC contract to start the construction of a dual-fuel, simple cycle power plant. The new facility will feature two 100 MW combustion turbine generators with state-of-the-art noise mitigating improvements with project completion expected to occur late in calendar year 2018. We are nearing peak construction activities on this project.\n\u00b7 In May 2017, APC announced that it received from T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas, S.A. (\u201cTR\u201d) a contract for the erection of a biomass boiler, a critical component of a new power plant being constructed in Teesside, which is near the northeast coast of England. Work began this past summer with completion scheduled for calendar year 2019. TR is a Spain-based global general contractor.\n\u00b7 In October 2017, APC was awarded a contract to perform certain engineering, procurement and construction services for InterGen, a company that develops, constructs and operates power projects around the world. The Spalding Energy Expansion plan includes APC's project for the expansion of the existing gas-fired power station in Spalding (located in the East Midlands region of England) including the addition of an open cycle gas turbine unit with a planned capacity of 298 MW. Substantial completion for this project is scheduled for calendar year 2019.\n\u00b7 During the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, we commenced financial and engineering support for the development of a 1,650 MW natural gas-fired power plant planned to be built in the PJM electricity region by a privately held business development firm. Included in the consideration for our commitment of financial support, the project development entity and GPS agreed to negotiate on an exclusive basis and enter into a contract for the provision of turnkey EPC services to the project. The value of this project has not been added to our backlog. If the development effort for this project remains on schedule, the development phase would be completed during calendar year 2019.\nIncome Tax Reform\nThe Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changes tax law in the United States by, among other items, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). At this time, we expect that our future effective tax rate will decrease meaningfully due to the Act. However, certain modifications of the Act will negatively impact our future effective tax rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction and the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The full effects of these changes will be reflected for the first time in income tax expense for the reporting periods included in the year ending January 31, 2019. The effect of the federal income tax rate change on our deferred taxes, a favorable adjustment of approximately $0.8 million, was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment\nRevenues of TRC declined during the year ended January 31, 2018 and it reported operating losses for the year. In our current year third quarter financial filing on Form 10-Q, we alerted stockholders that we may be required to record an impairment loss related to the goodwill of TRC in the fourth quarter of the current year up to an amount of $5.5 million subject to the completion of a full business valuation. TRC's management completed a reforecasting of its future financial results which provided essential data for the required annual goodwill assessment of TRC as of November 1, 2017. The forecast presents a less favorable outlook for TRC than in the past. With the decreased results of Fiscal 2018 and the less favorable outlook for TRC, our full valuation, blending the results of income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nMarket Outlook\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States in each of the last 10 years has not surpassed the total amount generated in the peak power generation year of 2007. For calendar year 2017, the total amount of electricity generation was approximately 97% of the level for 2007. Total electric power generation from all sources has decreased slightly over the past three years. Power demand gains related to economic growth and population increases have been offset by the effects of private electricity generation and energy efficiency advances. However, the base-case outlook recently published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts an annual increase in power generation for 2018 and steady growth through 2050 with average annual increases of a bit less than 1% per year.\nThe share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas in the United States fell from 34% in 2016 to about 32% in 2017 as a result of marginally higher natural gas prices and increased generation from renewables. Coal's generation share remained the same in 2017 as in 2016, about 30%. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the United States to rise from 32% in 2017 to 34% in both 2018 and 2019. The generation share from coal in both 2018 and 2019 is forecast to average 29%, down from 30% in 2017. The nuclear share was 20% in 2017 and is forecast to average 20% in 2018 and 19% in 2019. Non-hydropower renewables (i.e., wind and solar) provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017 and are expected to provide 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019. The generation share of hydropower was over 7% in 2017 and is forecast to fall below 7% in both 2018 and 2019. The EIA also forecasts steady growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.3% per year.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, nearly 60 GW of net coal-fired capacity was retired, partly as a result of new mercury and air-toxics standards. Most of the retired plants were older, smaller, less efficient coal-fired power plants. However, announcements by electric utilities of the retirement of coal-fired power plants continue, citing the availability of cheap natural gas, existing environmental regulations and the significant costs of refurbishment and relicensing. EIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by another 65 GW by 2030, even without adoption of the Clean Power Plan. Almost 5 GW of nuclear capacity has been retired over the last four to five years. The future of new nuclear power plant construction has been further clouded with the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, one of the few major nuclear providers of fuel, services, technology, plant design and equipment. Several utilities have made the decisions to either abandon construction or development of nuclear projects, leaving just one site under construction today (the Vogtle plant units 3 and 4) in the United States.\nThe retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity, and new natural gas-fired plants are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants, and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands. Relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, the benefits of natural gas as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues, power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies.\nCurrent projections of future natural gas-fired power generation assume the sustained increase in domestic natural gas production, which should lead to stable natural gas prices continuing into the future, including the near term. For example, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is forecast to be slightly less in January 2020 than it was in January 2017. The availability of competitively priced natural gas, the significant increases in the efficiency of combined cycle power plants, the existence of certain programs encouraging renewable fuel use, and the implementation of a series of environmental rules, primarily directed toward the reductions of air pollution and the emissions of greenhouse gases, should further reduce future coal use and continue to increase the share of the power generation mix represented by natural gas-fired power plants. By 2050, the base-case of the EIA forecasts that electricity generated by natural gas-fired power plants will represent 35% of the generation mix. It is true that the share of the mix represented by wind farms and solar fields are predicted to grow dramatically with accelerate growth in the near term boosted by extended tax credits; solar photovoltaic growth is predicted to continue throughout the forecast period as costs continue to decrease. Nonetheless, natural gas is predicted to be a top choice for new electricity generation plants in the future primarily due to low natural gas prices and the scheduled expiration of renewable energy tax credits.\nAs a result, we believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are generally favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the continuing retirement of inefficient and old coal and\nnuclear energy plants, should result in natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. In summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the United States should continue to provide construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above.\nWe have been successful in the completion of our EPC and other projects. Our four largest EPC projects continue to progress beyond the peak construction phases of their project life-cycles and toward completion. Consequently, the level of revenues associated with each one will continue to decline.\nWe are disappointed that we did not add a new major EPC contract to our backlog during Fiscal 2018. However, as identified above, we announced in March 2018 that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, which is located in Rockingham County. We expect to add the contract value of this project to project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018.\nWe are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC contract to us. With a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC contracting services and with the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our future plans continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 814,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (17.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 892,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 452,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,071\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (14.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 743,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 528,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (70.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,907\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,080\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,763\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (95.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ARGAN, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for the prior year, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for\nthe prior year. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. The percent-complete for these four projects ranged from 83% to 92% as of January 31, 2018.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed last year represented 14% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the United Kingdom.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for the prior year. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in the prior year period associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during the prior year.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for the prior year, as SMC has been successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside premises, including $5.2 million related to a fiber-to-the-home project for a municipal customer, and inside premises projects.\nCost of Revenues\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $149.3 million and $146.7 million, respectively. The Company's overall gross profit percentages of revenues were 16.7% and 21.7% for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decline in the percentage between years reflected the favorable achievement of contractual final completion of two natural gas-fired power plant projects last year which eliminated a number of significant risks and the related estimated costs associated with them, resulting in increased gross margins.\nThe current year gross profit percentage primarily reflects execution on the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant projects of GPS. However, while all of these projects are progressing, certain of the natural gas-fired power plant projects have experienced meaningful increased labor and subcontractor costs to amounts greater than originally estimated. The increases in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the corresponding reductions in the amounts of forecasted gross margins resulted in a reduction to consolidated gross profit being recognized during the latter half of the year. The gross profit percentage increased at APC and SMC and decreased at TRC, resulting in a net aggregate gross profit percent decrease of 1.0% of the combined revenues of the non-GPS entities between the years.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThese costs were $41.8 million and $32.5 million for Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 4.7% and 4.8% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively. Approximately $5.6 million of the increase between the years was due to an overall increase in salaries and incentive compensation costs driven by increased operations and project work, primarily at GPS and APC. In addition, stock option compensation expense increased by approximately $2.3 million between the years, primarily due to increased market prices of our common stock at the date that the majority of the corresponding stock options were granted. The remaining $1.4 million increase from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2018 related to increased contributions to employee retirement plans, employee separation costs and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.\nImpairment Losses\nAs indicated above, the revenues of TRC declined for Fiscal 2018 and it reported operating losses during the year. As indicated in our current year third quarter financial filing, we noted that we may be required to record an impairment loss related to the goodwill of TRC in the fourth quarter of the current year subject to the completion of a full valuation. TRC's management completed a reforecasting of its future financial results which provided essential data for the required annual goodwill assessment of TRC as of November 1, 2017. The forecast presents a less favorable outlook for TRC than in prior years. With the decreased results in Fiscal 2018 and less favorable outlook for TRC, our full valuation, reflecting a blend of results determined by several income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nLast year, the revenues of APC declined and it reported operating losses. In July 2016, work was suspended on APC's largest project at the time, which represented over 90% of APC's project backlog. Additionally, APC's primary market is in the United Kingdom, which voted to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The resulting pound sterling drop, financial market uncertainty and recessionary pressures were thought to likely impact the availability of financing for future power plant developments. Given these circumstances, analyses were performed mid-year in order to determine whether an impairment loss related to goodwill had been incurred. Using income and market approaches, the assessment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at that time. As a result, APC recorded an impairment loss during the year ended January 31, 2017 of approximately $2.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8%. The annual income tax rate is higher than our blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. The latter benefit declined significantly between years as the volume of stock option exercises decreased in Fiscal 2018. In recent years, we also obtained substantial benefit from the exclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interests in joint ventures which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see the next paragraph); for Fiscal 2018, the income tax benefit of the exclusion was only $0.1 million due to the substantial wind-up of activities by the joint ventures.\nFor Fiscal 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million resulting in an annual effective income tax rate of 32.4%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% due to the net favorable effect of the amounts of permanent differences for the year. Most significantly, favorable permanent differences related to 1) the treatment of the excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2017, 2) the domestic production activities deduction and 3) the exclusion from taxable income of the income attributable to non-controlling interests which reduced income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 by $5.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The unfavorable effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, was $4.0 million. The unfavorable effects of other permanent differences for Fiscal 2017 included the exclusions of certain executive compensation and portions of certain meals, entertainment and out-of-town living expenses which were $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In addition, the foreign income tax rate differential effect of the loss of APC for Fiscal 2017 was unfavorable in the amount of $0.9 million. Other adjustments and differences provided a net unfavorable effect on income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 in the amount of $0.8 million.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we entered separate construction joint ventures related to two natural gas-fired power plant projects. Because we have financial control, the joint ventures are included in our consolidated financial statements. Our joint venture partner's share of the earnings is reflected in the line item captioned net income attributable to non-controlling interests included in the accompanying statements of earnings for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 in the amounts of $0.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The reduction in the amount between years primarily reflected the contractual completion of the projects last year, with the provision of warranty services being the primary remaining obligations of the joint ventures.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2017 and 2016\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2017. For Fiscal 2016, we reported a comparable net income amount of $36.3 million, or $2.42 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 387,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 417.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (954\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (9.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 413,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 261,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 452,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 161,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 340.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 528,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 313,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,761\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (48.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ARGAN, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM = Not Meaningful\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $199.0 million to $586.6 million for Fiscal 2017, compared with revenues of $387.6 million for Fiscal 2016, representing an increase of 51% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017, and approximately 94% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2016. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment was primarily the result of a more than eight-fold increase in revenues earned from the activities associated with four EPC projects as they ramped up construction activities in Fiscal 2017. Two gas-fired power plant projects provided 68% less revenues in Fiscal 2017 as they reached final completion during that year. In Fiscal 2016, the combined revenues associated with these two power plant projects represented approximately 73% of consolidated revenues. In addition, Fiscal 2017 included a full year of revenues for APC compared to Fiscal 2016 (which represented approximately eight months of revenues). Fiscal 2016 revenues also included project development success fees in the amount of $4.3 million.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nFiscal 2017 represented the first full year of activity for this reportable segment, with revenues of $79.0 million, as we acquired TRC on December 4, 2015. For Fiscal 2016, the revenues from this business reflected less than two months of our ownership.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this business segment decreased by $1.0 million, or 9%, during Fiscal 2017 when compared to the prior year. During Fiscal 2016, revenues earned in connection with underground cabling work performed at multiple commuter train stations for the Maryland Transportation Administration was completed; it represented approximately 29% of SMC's revenues for that year. There was no corresponding project for Fiscal 2017.\nCost of Revenues\nDue to the increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $528.3 million and $313.8 million for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $146.7 million and $99.5 million, respectively. The Company's overall gross profit percentages of revenues were 21.7% and 24.1% for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Our overall gross profit percentages were lower in Fiscal 2017 when compared to Fiscal 2016 due to the new EPC projects of GPS and the addition of APC and TRC. However, for both fiscal years, gross profits were elevated due to the similarities of the two natural gas-fired power plant projects and by their approaching contractual final completion dates. As a result, we mitigated a number of significant risks and were able to reduce the related estimated costs associated with them, resulting in increased gross margins at that time.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThese costs increased by $7.4 million to $32.5 million for Fiscal 2017 from $25.1 million for Fiscal 2016. This increase primarily reflected the addition of a full year of selling, general and administrative costs for APC and TRC which were $9.3 million combined for Fiscal 2017, compared to $3.4 million in the prior year. The remaining net increase of $1.5 million between periods related mostly to incentive compensation expense associated with EPC projects completed during Fiscal 2017 and additional human resource costs incurred in Fiscal 2017 related to the increased project work. These costs for Fiscal 2017 also included a provision for uncollectible accounts, most of which related to project development loans made in prior years, in the amount of $1.2 million. Overall, selling, general and administrative expense amounts were 4.8% and 6.1% of revenues for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.\nImpairment Loss\nAs discussed above, APC recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $2.0 million that was reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for Fiscal 2017. No impairment loss was incurred or recorded during Fiscal 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor Fiscal 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million resulting in an annual effective income tax rate of 32.4%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% due to the net favorable effect of the amounts of permanent differences for the year. Most significantly, favorable permanent differences related to 1) the treatment of the excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2017, 2) the domestic manufacturing deduction and 3) the exclusion from taxable income of the income attributable to non-controlling interests which reduced income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 by $5.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The unfavorable effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, was $4.0 million. The unfavorable effects of other permanent differences for Fiscal 2017 included the exclusions of certain executive compensation and portions of certain meals, entertainment and out-of-town living expenses which were $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In addition, the foreign income tax rate differential effect of the loss reported by APC for Fiscal 2017 was unfavorable in the amount of $0.9 million. Other adjustments and differences provided a net unfavorable effect on income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 in the amount of $0.8 million.\nFor Fiscal 2016, we recorded income tax expense of approximately $25.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of 33.5%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the favorable permanent effect, amounting to $4.8 million, of excluding the income attributable to our joint venture partner from our taxable income. As the joint ventures are treated as partnerships for income tax reporting purposes, we report only our share of the taxable income of the entities. Our annual effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 also reflected the permanent benefit of the domestic production activities deduction in the amount of $1.6 million. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, in the amount of $4.0 million.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nAs discussed above, our construction joint ventures are included in our consolidated financial statements. Our joint venture partner's share of the earnings is reflected in the line item net income attributable to non-controlling interests of the accompanying statements of earnings for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 in the amounts of $7.1 million and $13.9 million, respectively. The reduction between years primarily reflects decreased end-of-project activity and the completion of the two gas-fired power projects during Fiscal 2017 as compared to greater activity in the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of January 31, 2018 and 2017\nAs of January 31, 2018 and 2017, our balances of cash and cash equivalents were $122.1 million and $167.2 million, respectively. During this same period, our working capital increased by $64.6 million to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\nThe net amount of cash used by operating activities during Fiscal 2018 was $72.8 million. Even though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $80.1 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount primarily due to the effects of four major EPC projects. Because these projects are well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules, we experienced a net decrease during the current year in the amount of billings on current projects in excess of corresponding costs and estimated earnings, which represented a use of cash in the amount of $102.5 million. In general, we expect this unfavorable cash-flow trend to continue until the projects are completed and new EPC projects are added to the backlog. Primarily due to increasing project owner retainage amounts on current construction contracts, accounts receivable increased during Fiscal 2018, which represented a use of cash in the amount of $39.6 million. Other uses of cash included increased prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.6 million, primarily reflecting increased income tax payments, and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $6.2 million, primarily reflecting the run-off of our warranty obligations related to power plants completed in prior years.\nOur primary source of this cash during Fiscal 2018 was the net maturity of short-term investments (certificates of deposit issued by our Bank, or CDs) in the amount of $45.0 million. In addition, the exercise of options to purchase 109,500 shares of our common stock provided us with cash proceeds in the approximate amount of $3.2 million. Non-operating activity cash uses included primarily the payment of a cash dividend of $15.5 million. During the current year, we also used cash as our consolidated joint ventures made distributions to our joint venture partner in the total amount of $1.2 million. Our operating subsidiaries used cash during the current year in the amount of $4.8 million for capital expenditures and GPS funded $1.5 million in development loans to various power facility project development entities. As of January 31, 2018, there were no restrictions with respect to inter-company payments from GPS, TRC, APC or SMC to the holding company.\nDuring Fiscal 2017, our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by $6.3 million to $167.2 million as of January 31, 2017 from a balance of $160.9 million as of January 31, 2016. During this same year, our working capital increased by $74.3 million to $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017 from $162.9 million as of January 31, 2016.\nNet income for Fiscal 2017, including the favorable adjustments related to noncash expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $86.7 million. In addition, we experienced a net decrease of $9.2 million in accounts receivable during the year primarily due to the receipt of retainages on two power plant projects as we achieved contractual final completion during the year. We had a net increase of $104.3 million in the amount of billings on uncompleted projects that temporarily exceeds the corresponding amounts of costs and estimated earnings, which primarily reflected the activities of GPS on four EPC contracts. Our net accounts payable and accrued expenses were also impacted with increased activities on these projects performed by our subcontractors and suppliers, which increased this balance by $59.5 million during Fiscal 2017. Primarily due to these factors, the net amount of cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2017 was $259.0 million. During Fiscal 2017, the exercise of options to purchase 621,750 shares of our common stock also provided us with cash proceeds in the amount of $15.9 million.\nOur primary use of this cash during Fiscal 2017 was the net purchase of CDs in the amount of $241.0 million. Additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $15.3 million during the year and our consolidated joint ventures made distributions to our joint venture partner in the total amount of $9.5 million. We also used cash during Fiscal 2017 for capital expenditures by the operating subsidiaries in the total amount of $2.8 million.\nOn May 15, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Bank as the lender which replaced a predecessor agreement and modified its features to, among other things:\n\u00b7 increase the Bank's lending commitment amount from $10.0 million to $50.0 million including a revolving loan with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.00%;\n\u00b7 add an accordion feature which allows for an additional commitment amount of $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions; and\n\u00b7 extend the maturity date three years from May 31, 2018 to May 31, 2021.\nAs with the predecessor agreement, we have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Bank's consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank will continue to require that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each fiscal quarter-end. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, we were compliant with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively.\nWe may use the borrowing ability to cover other credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. As of January 31, 2018, we had approximately $18.9 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, primarily to support our APC activities. However, we had no outstanding borrowings.\nIn addition, the commercial bank that has supported the activities of TRC issued an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit on its behalf in the amount of $0.4 million with a current expiration date in November 2018.\nAt January 31, 2018, most of our balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a high-quality money market fund with at least 80% of its net assets invested in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by United States Treasury obligations. Most of our domestic operating bank accounts are maintained with the Bank. We do maintain certain Euro-based bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland and insignificant bank accounts in other countries in support of the operations of APC.\nWe believe that cash on hand, cash that will be provided from the maturities of short-term investments and cash generated from our future operations, with or without funds available under our line of credit, will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future. In particular, we maintain significant liquid capital on our balance sheet to help ensure our ability to maintain and obtain bonding capacity for current and future EPC and other construction projects. Any future acquisitions, or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations outstanding as of January 31, 2018 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Over 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts represent primarily service arrangements. Commitments pursuant to purchase orders and subcontracts related to construction contracts are not included as such amounts are expected to be funded under contract billings. We have no significant obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete contracts awarded to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering, procurement and construction contracts. For certain projects, we are required by project owners to provide guarantees related to our services or work. If our services under a guaranteed project would not be completed or would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable, we would record such guarantee losses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation. We have a line of credit committed by the Bank in the amount of $50.0 million for general purposes. The Company may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for the Company's use in the ordinary course of business. As of January 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $18.9 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings.\nFrom time to time, we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services. We collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity. As of January 31, 2018, the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was $11.1 million.\nAs is common in our industry, EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a project owner. These teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project or program. In addition, as discussed previously, we may obtain interests in VIEs formed by its owners for a specific purpose.\nWe have financial control of the construction joint ventures formed for the purpose of building two power plants, which were completed in Fiscal 2017 and are currently in their respective warranty periods. As such, the accounts of the joint ventures are included in our consolidated financial statements for the years since their formations.\nWe considered ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of VIEs formed by an independent firm for the purposes of developing three natural gas-fired power plants. In agreements negotiated with the developer, we provided substantial portions of the funding for these efforts. During these periods, we included the accounts of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. Subsequently, substantial ownership interests in each entity were sold and construction financing was arranged for each project in separate transactions. The most recent transaction occurred during Fiscal 2016 (see the discussion of variable interest entities included in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In each case, we deconsolidated the VIE when we were no longer providing financial support.\nWe entered into a similar support arrangement with an independent firm in connection with a power plant development opportunity in January 2018 and we may enter into other support arrangements in the future in connection with power plant development opportunities when we are confident that financing will lead to the award of the corresponding EPC contracts.\nIn connection with the January 2018 support arrangement, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is in the early stages of development efforts for the construction of a new natural gas-fired power plant. Although the account balances of the VIE are not material, they are included in the consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2018.\nInflation\nOur monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivables, and our non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, are not affected significantly by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of our building, improvements, equipment and furniture will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our costs and expenses, such as those for employee compensation and benefits and commodities used in construction projects, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of previously contracted services offered by us.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Non-GAAP Measurement)\nWe believe that Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure, the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions. Further, we believe that EBITDA is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance.\nAs EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d), we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the results of our operations presented in accordance with US GAAP that are included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our EBITDA does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nThe following tables present the determinations of EBITDA for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (amounts in thousands).\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDescriptions of the Company's significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, are included in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2018. We consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long-term construction contracts; the accounting for business combinations, the subsequent valuation of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the valuation of employee stock options; income tax reporting and the financial reporting associated with any significant claims or legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, as well as the accounting and reporting for special purpose entities including joint ventures and variable interest entities. Critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in arriving at estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions.\nThese estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into EPC and other long-term construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids or in conjunction with our support of the development of power projects. The types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which revenues are based on a fixed-price, time and materials and cost-plus-fee basis. All of the current EPC-type contracts of our power industry services reporting segment, and certain contracts awarded to our other companies, are fixed-price contracts for which revenues are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage-of-completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion. This requires us to prepare on-going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses. In preparing these estimates, we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant costs, including materials, labor and equipment, and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances, production delays or other productivity factors. Revenues from cost-plus-fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured using the cost-to-cost method. Components of fee based on our achievement of certain cost or schedule objectives are included when we believe it is probable that such amounts have been earned. As presented in Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the gross profit determined and reported for the power industry services business segment and its performance on long-term contracts during the year ended January 31, 2018 was $139.2 million.\nActual costs may vary from the costs we estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs, along with other risks inherent in fixed-price contracts, may result in actual revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined, without regard to the percentage of completion. No such significant loss was identified by us during the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. However, significant losses on certain contracts were recognized by TRC prior to our acquisition on December 4, 2015. We review the estimate of total cost on each company's significant contracts monthly. We believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts at each company going forward is limited by our management's experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses.\nUnpriced change orders, which represent contract variations for which we have project owner directive for additional work or authorization for scope changes but not for the price associated with the corresponding change, are reflected in revenues when it is probable that the applicable costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. The total amount of unpriced change orders included in contract value amounts used to determine revenues as of January 31, 2018 was $9.3 million. Amounts of identified change orders that are not yet considered probable as of the corresponding balance sheet date are excluded from forecasted revenues. Actual costs related to change orders are expensed as they are incurred. Contract results may be impacted by estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive. The effects of any resulting revisions to revenues and estimated costs can be determined at any time and they could be material. In general, claims that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are reflected in revenues only when an agreement on the amount has been reached with the project owner.\nOur long-term contracts typically have schedule dates and other performance obligations that, if not achieved, could subject us to liquidated damages. These contract requirements generally relate to specified activities that must be completed by an established date or by achievement of a specified level of output or efficiency. Each contract defines the conditions under which a project owner may make a claim for liquidated damages. However, in some instances, potential liquidated damages are not asserted by a project owner, but may be considered during the negotiation or settlement of claims and the close-out of a contract. In general, we consider potential liquidated damages, the costs of other related items and potential mitigating factors in determining the adequacy of our estimates of completed contract costs.\nIn addition to revenues related to the core services provided by the power industry services segment, we received success fees associated with project development services in the aggregate amount of $4.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2016, as presented in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. No such fees were realized during the years ended January 31, 2018 or 2017. As we were not relieved of our responsibility to provide working capital funding for the project started by the project developer (our primary responsibility under the related development agreement) until the closing of its purchase by a third party, and as this project did not have the means to pay development success fees until the financial closing occurred, we did not consider the development success fee related to this project to be earned or realizable until we received payment of the fees at the closing of the purchase. Accordingly, we recognized the fees related to this project at the time of its closing.\nGoodwill\nIn connection with the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC, we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and certain fabrication process certifications. We utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the initial determinations of goodwill and the other purchased intangible assets for these acquisitions. Other than goodwill, most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives.\nAt January 31, 2018, the goodwill balances related to the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC were $18.5 million, $13.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which together represented approximately 5.7% of consolidated total assets. The Company customarily reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually as of November 1. We also perform tests for impairment of the goodwill more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its value might be impaired, as occurred with APC last year.\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Past guidance required a public entity to perform a two-step test to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. In Step 1, an entity compared the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the entity performed Step 2 and compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill for that reporting unit. An impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill for the unit exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill was recorded. However, under the past guidance, the implied fair value of goodwill was required to be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire it.\nThe new pronouncement removes the second step of the impairment test. An entity shall apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. As permitted, we adopted the new standard early, effective February 1, 2017, and used the new guidance in the performance of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed as of November 1, 2017. The effect of the adoption of this new standard was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe new standard did not change the simplified approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the more complex quantitative goodwill impairment test. We are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The professional guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic, industry, market and entity-specific factors.\nAs of November 1, 2017, we considered the significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of GPS that was determined four years ago, its continued strong financial performance during the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, its project backlog and other future business prospects and various other business environment and market conditions. We believe that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the GPS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of November 1, 2017. Therefore, completion of the two-step impairment assessment process was considered to be unnecessary as of November 1, 2017. No events associated with the business of GPS occurred in the period from the assessment date through January 31, 2018 that would cause us to reconsider that conclusion.\nWe performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2017 with the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. The carrying value of the goodwill for TRC is $14.4 million. It was determined that the fair value of TRC was slightly less than its carrying value and a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $0.6 million was recorded. The fair value amount for TRC as of November 1, 2017 reflected a weighting of results determined using various business valuation approaches. The majority of the weighted average fair value was based on the result of modeling discounted future cash flows of the business. Giving greater weight to the valuation method based on comparable public companies would have increased the final blended amount of fair value.\nThe discounted cash flows of TRC were based on a management forecast of operating results reflecting, most importantly, a meaningful increase in revenues for the year ending January 31, 2019. Thereafter, the forecast reflects annual growth in revenues that ranges from 3.0% to 8.3% over the following six-year period with forecasted annual operating income increasing from 3.8% of revenues for the year ending January 31, 2019 to 6.5% of revenues for the year ending January 31, 2025. Although\nthe Company believes that the projected financial results are reasonable considering actual pre-acquisition levels of annual revenues earned by TRC and the current business prospects for TRC, any future results that would compare unfavorably with the projected results could result in a material impairment of the goodwill of TRC. In our opinion, no events related to TRC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 that would cause us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nWith the assistance of a professional business valuation firm, we performed a full assessment of the fair value of APC as of November 1, 2017. The result concluded that no additional impairment of goodwill had occurred as the operating results and business prospects of APC have improved. As discussed above and in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we concluded that APC had suffered a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $2.0 million that was recorded during the second fiscal quarter last year. In our opinion, no events related to APC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 that would cause us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nOur consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 included deferred tax liabilities in the amounts of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and deferred tax assets in the amounts of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The components of our deferred tax amounts are presented in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These amounts reflect differences in the periods in which certain transactions are recognized for financial and income tax reporting purposes.\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including those related to the net operating losses of TRC and APC that applicable income tax rules will allow us to use in order to offset future amounts of applicable operating income, depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and assumptions regarding income amounts change in the future, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of earnings. At this time, we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services segment, strengthening new business prospects for APC and benefits of certain income tax strategies will provide sufficient income during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible to utilize the applicable temporary income tax differences. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of significantly all of our deferred tax assets.\nPursuant to current professional guidance for the accounting for income taxes, the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate (see the discussion above and Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) caused us to revalue our deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017. As a result, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $0.8 million that was reflected in the amount of income tax expense for the year ended January 31, 2018, and which represents our estimate of the impact of the change in the tax rate on our deferred taxes (deferred tax liabilities are greater than deferred tax assets).\nStock Options\nWe measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of stock option awards and we recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods which have typically been one year. However, the awards granted in January 2018 include three-year vesting periods. We expect that future awards will typically vest over three years with one-third of the vesting occurring on each anniversary date of the corresponding award. Pursuant to our accounting, we will continue to record expense for the fair value of each stock option award ratably over the corresponding vesting period. Options to purchase 301,500, 270,000 and 300,000 shares of our common stock were awarded during the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with weighted average fair value per share amounts of $13.55, $14.93 and $8.97, respectively. The amounts of compensation expense recorded during the corresponding years related to vesting stock options were $4.7 million, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations, which are disclosed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of each stock option. Changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards. Historically, we used the \u201csimplified method\u201d in estimating the expected lives of awarded stock options as we believed that the amounts of fair value per share calculated based on these estimated lives were reasonable. However, we now believe that our stock option exercise activity, particularly over the last three to four years, has become sufficient to provide us with a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives. Accordingly, the estimated expected life\nused in the determination of the fair value of each stock option awarded since January 2017 was approximately 3.3 years. The simplified method would have resulted in the use of 5.5 years for the estimated expected life of each of these stock options. The aggregate fair value of the initial group of stock options reflecting the lower expected life that were awarded in January 2017 was reduced by $0.8 million, or approximately 20%. For stock options awarded during the year ended January 31, 2018, the aggregate fair value was reduced by $0.9 million, or approximately 18%.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe must consolidate any VIEs in which we have variable interests if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date.\nIn the past, our evaluations have affirmed that, despite not having ownership interests in certain power plant development VIEs, GPS was the corresponding primary beneficiary due primarily to the significance of GPI's loans to each entity, the risk that GPS could absorb significant losses if the development project was not successful, the opportunity for GPS to receive a development success fee and the commitment of the project developer in each case to award the large EPC contract for the construction of the power plant to GPS. As a result, the accounts of each VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements until each one substantially completed its successful project development efforts and financial support was thereafter provided substantially by a pending investor. At this point in the life of each VIE, we deconsolidated it. The most recent deconsolidation resulted in a pre-tax gain for Fiscal 2016 in the amount of $0.3 million.\nAs of January 31, 2018, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is in the early stages of a development effort for the construction of a new natural gas-fired power plant. Consideration for the engineering and financial support of GPS includes our receipt of the right to negotiate the corresponding turnkey EPC contract for the project on an exclusive basis. Although the account balances of the VIE were not material, we did include them in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2018.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe do become involved in legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us. At this time, we do not believe that any additional material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed herein. However, we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter. We review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter, and make adjustments to the balances if necessary. Should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change, significant losses or additional costs may be recorded. On the other hand, the final outcome of a legal matter may result in the reversal of accrued liabilities established in prior periods. We believe that our accounting for legal contingencies during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018 has been appropriate. As discussed below, the resolution of certain significant legal matters during this period resulted in favorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements.\nAs disclosed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on February 1, 2016, TRC was sued in Person County, North Carolina, by PPS, a former subcontractor, in an attempt to force TRC to pay invoices for services rendered in the total amount of $2.3 million. PPS has placed liens on the property of the customers in several states where work was performed by PPS and it has also filed a claim against the bond issued on behalf of TRC relating to one significant project located in Tennessee in the amount of $2.5 million. On March 4, 2016, TRC filed responses to the claims of PPS. The positions of TRC are that PPS failed to deliver a number of items required by the applicable contract between the parties and that the invoices rendered by PPS covering the disputed services will not be paid until such deliverables are supplied. Further, TRC maintains that certain sums are owed to it by PPS for services, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and software that were supplied by TRC on behalf of PPS that total approximately $2.2 million. The amounts invoiced by PPS are accrued by TRC and the corresponding liability amount was included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2018 and 2017. TRC has not recorded an account receivable for the amounts it believes are owed to it by PPS. A mediation effort was attempted in 2016 but it was unproductive and an impasse was declared. In December 2017, an amended complaint was filed by the plaintiff and TRC filed an amended counterclaim. In anticipation of a trial, the discovery process has begun. We intend to defend against the claims of PPS and to pursue its claim against PPS. Due to the uncertainty of the ultimate outcomes of these legal proceedings, assurance cannot be provided by us that TRC will be successful in these efforts. We do not believe that resolution of the matters discussed above will result in additional loss with material negative effect on our consolidated operating results in a future reporting period.\nGPS has a dispute with a former subcontractor on one of its power plant construction projects that is scheduled for binding arbitration in the coming months. The subcontractor, terminated for cause by GPS, has claimed damages of approximately $11.0 million. GPS has submitted a counterclaim for an amount related to the value of the subcontract completed by GPS. We cannot make an estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, related to this matter. It is possible that resolution of the matter could result in a loss with a material negative effect on the Company's consolidated operating results in a future reporting period.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNote 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes descriptions of the two accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that were pending as of January 31, 2018 and that we believe are materially relevant to our future financial reporting. These include Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was issued in May 2014 and which has been amended multiple times, and ASU 2016-02, Leases, which was issued in February 2016. ASU 2014-09 represents an effort to create a new, principles-based revenue recognition framework for all companies that was adopted by us on February 1, 2018. ASU 2016-02, which will be adopted by us on February 1, 2019, will require the recognition on the balance sheet of all operating leases with terms greater than one year. Note 2 also describes our early adoption of ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, for the year ended January 31, 2018. The change to goodwill impairment assessment described therein was employed by us in our annual goodwill impairment test conducted for TRC as of November 1, 2017.", "summary": "The report provides a summary of Argan, Inc.'s financial position and operations for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

GPS, including its consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), if any, and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the United States and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and piping systems. Through SMC, now conducting business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nOverview\nFiscal 2018 was another year of growth for us.\n\u00b7 Revenues increased 32.3% to $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $675.0 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our overall gross profit amount increased 1.8% to $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $146.7 million for the prior year. However, our overall gross profit percentage decreased to 16.7% for Fiscal 2018 as compared to 21.7% for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Net income attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 2.4% to $72.0 million for Fiscal 2018, or 8.1% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $70.3 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 EBITDA(1) attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 5.0% to $116.1 million for Fiscal 2018, or 13.0% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $110.6 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our international subsidiary, APC, has begun to capitalize on the opportunities foreseen when we acquired this business in Fiscal 2016. During the current year, it was awarded two meaningful construction-type contracts related to power plants in the United Kingdom with a combined contract value in excess of $110 million.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid $1.00 per share in cash dividends during Fiscal 2018. In addition, we announced our intent to declare and pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, starting in the first quarter ending April 30, 2018.\n\u00b7 Our tangible net worth(2) increased by 27.4% to $316.6 million as of January 31, 2018 from $248.5 million as of January 31, 2017.\n\u00b7 Our liquidity, or working capital(3), increased by 27.2% to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\n(1) EBITDA is a measure not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have defined EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (see the presentation of EBITDA for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 on page 37 below).\n(2) We define tangible net worth as our total stockholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net.\n(3) We define working capital as our total current assets less our total current liabilities.\nSince the acquisition of GPS in December 2006, over eleven years ago, we have lead our business through challenging industry economic cycles with the growth in revenues and profitability trending upwards as illustrated below. We have achieved an average annual growth in revenues of 16% per year and an average growth in EBITDA of 32% per year. Note that the amounts in the chart for Net Income and EBITDA below are attributable to the stockholders of Argan, Inc. (dollars in millions).\nThese results could not have been achieved without the operational efforts of our employees, particularly during the last three years. Over this period, their dedication to perform multiple tasks and to overcome many associated hurdles was especially reflected in our successfully achieving peak and post-peak construction activities on four EPC projects while completing two other gas-fired power plant projects. These six EPC projects were most significant to our financial results for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, collectively representing 84%, 83% and 86%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. However, while the remaining four projects are progressing, we increased our estimated costs to complete certain EPC projects primarily due to increased labor and subcontractor costs. The corresponding reduction in the amounts of forecasted gross margins had an unfavorable effect on the gross profit amounts reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the latter half of Fiscal 2018 which caused, in part, our consolidated gross profit percentage to decline.\nWith the remaining four GPS projects discussed above, plus one other, projected to be completed in the year ending January 31, 2019 (\u201cFiscal 2019\u201d), and our project backlog reduced to $379 million as of January 31, 2018, we expect our revenues to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. We do expect to add new EPC projects to our project backlog during Fiscal 2019 as discussed below; however, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect Fiscal 2019 to be a year where we transition from the final stages of our existing projects to the early stages of expected new projects. We are cautiously optimistic that the growth of our consolidated revenues will resume in Fiscal 2020 and continue into the future as we are awarded new construction projects and they mature.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nAt January 31, 2018, our project backlog was $379 million. The following table summarizes our large power plant projects:\n\n(1) FNTP represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\n(2) Project values added to project backlog during Fiscal 2018.\nOur reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Although project backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Despite the new awards that are identified above, the total value of our project backlog has declined significantly during Fiscal 2018 which principally reflects the amounts of revenues earned by GPS due to its performance on the first four projects identified above. These four projects were the most significant drivers of our financial results for Fiscal 2018, which together represented approximately 84% of our consolidated revenues. Revenues for each of these projects will continue to decline over the next several quarters as they progress through the commissioning and start-up stages of their project life-cycles.\nWe believe that the slowdown in new business awards to GPS may relate, at least in part, to uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, the increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and the improvements and decreasing prices in renewable energy storage solutions. These factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be delayed by project owners. Other unfavorable factors may include disappointing energy capacity auctions held during the last couple of years for new power generating assets and the impacts of environmental activism.\nIn Fiscal 2018, we saw approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines develop as hurdles for gas-fired power plant developers. Interstate pipelines require the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), whose members require a quorum to act. The lack of a quorum for a period of six months earlier in Fiscal 2018 left FERC unable to provide approval decisions on major energy projects. New members were appointed and approved, but progress in reducing the number of pending decisions was slow. An increase in the number and fervor of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects has garnered media attention and public skepticism about new pipelines resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nDespite the expected revenues decline for GPS in Fiscal 2019, we are encouraged by the new business awarded to our other operating units since the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, we are cautiously optimistic about GPS. On March 27, 2018, we announced that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina. We expect to add the value of this project, approximately $250 million, to our project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018. Also, GPS has been selected by the owners of several other projects to negotiate EPC service contracts with aggregate potential project value in excess of $1.5 billion (including the value of the plant discussed in the fourth bullet point below) and with projected start dates ranging from later in 2018 through 2019. We have performed certain pre-contract tasks at the request of several of these project owners. Nonetheless, GPS has not received a limited or full notice to proceed on any of the projects discussed in this paragraph, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built. None of these projects were reflected in our project backlog at January 31, 2018. Other significant new business accomplishments during the year ended January 31, 2018 related to the following projects.\n\u00b7 During Fiscal 2018, the owner of a power project located in Medway, Massachusetts provided us with the necessary authorization under the corresponding turnkey EPC contract to start the construction of a dual-fuel, simple cycle power plant. The new facility will feature two 100 MW combustion turbine generators with state-of-the-art noise mitigating improvements with project completion expected to occur late in calendar year 2018. We are nearing peak construction activities on this project.\n\u00b7 In May 2017, APC announced that it received from T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas, S.A. (\u201cTR\u201d) a contract for the erection of a biomass boiler, a critical component of a new power plant being constructed in Teesside, which is near the northeast coast of England. Work began this past summer with completion scheduled for calendar year 2019. TR is a Spain-based global general contractor.\n\u00b7 In October 2017, APC was awarded a contract to perform certain engineering, procurement and construction services for InterGen, a company that develops, constructs and operates power projects around the world. The Spalding Energy Expansion plan includes APC's project for the expansion of the existing gas-fired power station in Spalding (located in the East Midlands region of England) including the addition of an open cycle gas turbine unit with a planned capacity of 298 MW. Substantial completion for this project is scheduled for calendar year 2019.\n\u00b7 During the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, we commenced financial and engineering support for the development of a 1,650 MW natural gas-fired power plant planned to be built in the PJM electricity region by a privately held business development firm. Included in the consideration for our commitment of financial support, the project development entity and GPS agreed to negotiate on an exclusive basis and enter into a contract for the provision of turnkey EPC services to the project. The value of this project has not been added to our backlog. If the development effort for this project remains on schedule, the development phase would be completed during calendar year 2019.\nIncome Tax Reform\nThe Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changes tax law in the United States by, among other items, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). At this time, we expect that our future effective tax rate will decrease meaningfully due to the Act. However, certain modifications of the Act will negatively impact our future effective tax rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction and the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The full effects of these changes will be reflected for the first time in income tax expense for the reporting periods included in the year ending January 31, 2019. The effect of the federal income tax rate change on our deferred taxes, a favorable adjustment of approximately $0.8 million, was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment\nRevenues of TRC declined during the year ended January 31, 2018 and it reported operating losses for the year. In our current year third quarter financial filing on Form 10-Q, we alerted stockholders that we may be required to record an impairment loss related to the goodwill of TRC in the fourth quarter of the current year up to an amount of $5.5 million subject to the completion of a full business valuation. TRC's management completed a reforecasting of its future financial results which provided essential data for the required annual goodwill assessment of TRC as of November 1, 2017. The forecast presents a less favorable outlook for TRC than in the past. With the decreased results of Fiscal 2018 and the less favorable outlook for TRC, our full valuation, blending the results of income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nMarket Outlook\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States in each of the last 10 years has not surpassed the total amount generated in the peak power generation year of 2007. For calendar year 2017, the total amount of electricity generation was approximately 97% of the level for 2007. Total electric power generation from all sources has decreased slightly over the past three years. Power demand gains related to economic growth and population increases have been offset by the effects of private electricity generation and energy efficiency advances. However, the base-case outlook recently published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts an annual increase in power generation for 2018 and steady growth through 2050 with average annual increases of a bit less than 1% per year.\nThe share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas in the United States fell from 34% in 2016 to about 32% in 2017 as a result of marginally higher natural gas prices and increased generation from renewables. Coal's generation share remained the same in 2017 as in 2016, about 30%. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the United States to rise from 32% in 2017 to 34% in both 2018 and 2019. The generation share from coal in both 2018 and 2019 is forecast to average 29%, down from 30% in 2017. The nuclear share was 20% in 2017 and is forecast to average 20% in 2018 and 19% in 2019. Non-hydropower renewables (i.e., wind and solar) provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017 and are expected to provide 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019. The generation share of hydropower was over 7% in 2017 and is forecast to fall below 7% in both 2018 and 2019. The EIA also forecasts steady growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.3% per year.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, nearly 60 GW of net coal-fired capacity was retired, partly as a result of new mercury and air-toxics standards. Most of the retired plants were older, smaller, less efficient coal-fired power plants. However, announcements by electric utilities of the retirement of coal-fired power plants continue, citing the availability of cheap natural gas, existing environmental regulations and the significant costs of refurbishment and relicensing. EIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by another 65 GW by 2030, even without adoption of the Clean Power Plan. Almost 5 GW of nuclear capacity has been retired over the last four to five years. The future of new nuclear power plant construction has been further clouded with the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, one of the few major nuclear providers of fuel, services, technology, plant design and equipment. Several utilities have made the decisions to either abandon construction or development of nuclear projects, leaving just one site under construction today (the Vogtle plant units 3 and 4) in the United States.\nThe retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity, and new natural gas-fired plants are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants, and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands. Relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, the benefits of natural gas as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues, power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies.\nCurrent projections of future natural gas-fired power generation assume the sustained increase in domestic natural gas production, which should lead to stable natural gas prices continuing into the future, including the near term. For example, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is forecast to be slightly less in January 2020 than it was in January 2017. The availability of competitively priced natural gas, the significant increases in the efficiency of combined cycle power plants, the existence of certain programs encouraging renewable fuel use, and the implementation of a series of environmental rules, primarily directed toward the reductions of air pollution and the emissions of greenhouse gases, should further reduce future coal use and continue to increase the share of the power generation mix represented by natural gas-fired power plants. By 2050, the base-case of the EIA forecasts that electricity generated by natural gas-fired power plants will represent 35% of the generation mix. It is true that the share of the mix represented by wind farms and solar fields are predicted to grow dramatically with accelerate growth in the near term boosted by extended tax credits; solar photovoltaic growth is predicted to continue throughout the forecast period as costs continue to decrease. Nonetheless, natural gas is predicted to be a top choice for new electricity generation plants in the future primarily due to low natural gas prices and the scheduled expiration of renewable energy tax credits.\nAs a result, we believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are generally favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the continuing retirement of inefficient and old coal and\nnuclear energy plants, should result in natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. In summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the United States should continue to provide construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above.\nWe have been successful in the completion of our EPC and other projects. Our four largest EPC projects continue to progress beyond the peak construction phases of their project life-cycles and toward completion. Consequently, the level of revenues associated with each one will continue to decline.\nWe are disappointed that we did not add a new major EPC contract to our backlog during Fiscal 2018. However, as identified above, we announced in March 2018 that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, which is located in Rockingham County. We expect to add the contract value of this project to project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018.\nWe are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC contract to us. With a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC contracting services and with the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our future plans continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\n\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for the prior year, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for\nthe prior year. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. The percent-complete for these four projects ranged from 83% to 92% as of January 31, 2018.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed last year represented 14% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the United Kingdom.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for the prior year. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in the prior year period associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during the prior year.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for the prior year, as SMC has been successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside premises, including $5.2 million related to a fiber-to-the-home project for a municipal customer, and inside premises projects.\nCost of Revenues\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of Argan, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of January 31, 2018, and the results of their operations for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201c2018 Annual Report\u201d).\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain forward-looking statements.

GPS, including its consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), if any, and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the United States and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and piping systems. Through SMC, now conducting business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nOverview\nFiscal 2018 was another year of growth for us.\n\u00b7 Revenues increased 32.3% to $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $675.0 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our overall gross profit amount increased 1.8% to $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018 as compared to $146.7 million for the prior year. However, our overall gross profit percentage decreased to 16.7% for Fiscal 2018 as compared to 21.7% for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Net income attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 2.4% to $72.0 million for Fiscal 2018, or 8.1% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $70.3 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 EBITDA(1) attributable to the stockholders of Argan increased 5.0% to $116.1 million for Fiscal 2018, or 13.0% of consolidated revenues, as compared to $110.6 million for the prior year.\n\u00b7 Our international subsidiary, APC, has begun to capitalize on the opportunities foreseen when we acquired this business in Fiscal 2016. During the current year, it was awarded two meaningful construction-type contracts related to power plants in the United Kingdom with a combined contract value in excess of $110 million.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid $1.00 per share in cash dividends during Fiscal 2018. In addition, we announced our intent to declare and pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, starting in the first quarter ending April 30, 2018.\n\u00b7 Our tangible net worth(2) increased by 27.4% to $316.6 million as of January 31, 2018 from $248.5 million as of January 31, 2017.\n\u00b7 Our liquidity, or working capital(3), increased by 27.2% to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\n(1) EBITDA is a measure not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have defined EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (see the presentation of EBITDA for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 on page 37 below).\n(2) We define tangible net worth as our total stockholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net.\n(3) We define working capital as our total current assets less our total current liabilities.\nSince the acquisition of GPS in December 2006, over eleven years ago, we have lead our business through challenging industry economic cycles with the growth in revenues and profitability trending upwards as illustrated below. We have achieved an average annual growth in revenues of 16% per year and an average growth in EBITDA of 32% per year. Note that the amounts in the chart for Net Income and EBITDA below are attributable to the stockholders of Argan, Inc. (dollars in millions).\nThese results could not have been achieved without the operational efforts of our employees, particularly during the last three years. Over this period, their dedication to perform multiple tasks and to overcome many associated hurdles was especially reflected in our successfully achieving peak and post-peak construction activities on four EPC projects while completing two other gas-fired power plant projects. These six EPC projects were most significant to our financial results for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, collectively representing 84%, 83% and 86%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. However, while the remaining four projects are progressing, we increased our estimated costs to complete certain EPC projects primarily due to increased labor and subcontractor costs. The corresponding reduction in the amounts of forecasted gross margins had an unfavorable effect on the gross profit amounts reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the latter half of Fiscal 2018 which caused, in part, our consolidated gross profit percentage to decline.\nWith the remaining four GPS projects discussed above, plus one other, projected to be completed in the year ending January 31, 2019 (\u201cFiscal 2019\u201d), and our project backlog reduced to $379 million as of January 31, 2018, we expect our revenues to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. We do expect to add new EPC projects to our project backlog during Fiscal 2019 as discussed below; however, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect Fiscal 2019 to be a year where we transition from the final stages of our existing projects to the early stages of expected new projects. We are cautiously optimistic that the growth of our consolidated revenues will resume in Fiscal 2020 and continue into the future as we are awarded new construction projects and they mature.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nAt January 31, 2018, our project backlog was $379 million. The following table summarizes our large power plant projects:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> Current Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Facility Size\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FNTP Received(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Scheduled\nCompletion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,040 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CPV Towantic Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Connecticut\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 785 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NTE Kings Mountain Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NTE Middletown Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ohio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TeesREP Biomass Power Station(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Teesside (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> InterGen Spalding OCGT Expansion Project(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Spalding (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exelon West Medway II Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Massachusetts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) FNTP represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\n(2) Project values added to project backlog during Fiscal 2018.\nOur reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Although project backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Despite the new awards that are identified above, the total value of our project backlog has declined significantly during Fiscal 2018 which principally reflects the amounts of revenues earned by GPS due to its performance on the first four projects identified above. These four projects were the most significant drivers of our financial results for Fiscal 2018, which together represented approximately 84% of our consolidated revenues. Revenues for each of these projects will continue to decline over the next several quarters as they progress through the commissioning and start-up stages of their project life-cycles.\nWe believe that the slowdown in new business awards to GPS may relate, at least in part, to uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, the increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and the improvements and decreasing prices in renewable energy storage solutions. These factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be delayed by project owners. Other unfavorable factors may include disappointing energy capacity auctions held during the last couple of years for new power generating assets and the impacts of environmental activism.\nIn Fiscal 2018, we saw approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines develop as hurdles for gas-fired power plant developers. Interstate pipelines require the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), whose members require a quorum to act. The lack of a quorum for a period of six months earlier in Fiscal 2018 left FERC unable to provide approval decisions on major energy projects. New members were appointed and approved, but progress in reducing the number of pending decisions was slow. An increase in the number and fervor of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects has garnered media attention and public skepticism about new pipelines resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nDespite the expected revenues decline for GPS in Fiscal 2019, we are encouraged by the new business awarded to our other operating units since the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, we are cautiously optimistic about GPS. On March 27, 2018, we announced that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina. We expect to add the value of this project, approximately $250 million, to our project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018. Also, GPS has been selected by the owners of several other projects to negotiate EPC service contracts with aggregate potential project value in excess of $1.5 billion (including the value of the plant discussed in the fourth bullet point below) and with projected start dates ranging from later in 2018 through 2019. We have performed certain pre-contract tasks at the request of several of these project owners. Nonetheless, GPS has not received a limited or full notice to proceed on any of the projects discussed in this paragraph, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built. None of these projects were reflected in our project backlog at January 31, 2018. Other significant new business accomplishments during the year ended January 31, 2018 related to the following projects.\n\u00b7 During Fiscal 2018, the owner of a power project located in Medway, Massachusetts provided us with the necessary authorization under the corresponding turnkey EPC contract to start the construction of a dual-fuel, simple cycle power plant. The new facility will feature two 100 MW combustion turbine generators with state-of-the-art noise mitigating improvements with project completion expected to occur late in calendar year 2018. We are nearing peak construction activities on this project.\n\u00b7 In May 2017, APC announced that it received from T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas, S.A. (\u201cTR\u201d) a contract for the erection of a biomass boiler, a critical component of a new power plant being constructed in Teesside, which is near the northeast coast of England. Work began this past summer with completion scheduled for calendar year 2019. TR is a Spain-based global general contractor.\n\u00b7 In October 2017, APC was awarded a contract to perform certain engineering, procurement and construction services for InterGen, a company that develops, constructs and operates power projects around the world. The Spalding Energy Expansion plan includes APC's project for the expansion of the existing gas-fired power station in Spalding (located in the East Midlands region of England) including the addition of an open cycle gas turbine unit with a planned capacity of 298 MW. Substantial completion for this project is scheduled for calendar year 2019.\n\u00b7 During the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, we commenced financial and engineering support for the development of a 1,650 MW natural gas-fired power plant planned to be built in the PJM electricity region by a privately held business development firm. Included in the consideration for our commitment of financial support, the project development entity and GPS agreed to negotiate on an exclusive basis and enter into a contract for the provision of turnkey EPC services to the project. The value of this project has not been added to our backlog. If the development effort for this project remains on schedule, the development phase would be completed during calendar year 2019.\nIncome Tax Reform\nThe Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changes tax law in the United States by, among other items, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). At this time, we expect that our future effective tax rate will decrease meaningfully due to the Act. However, certain modifications of the Act will negatively impact our future effective tax rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction and the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The full effects of these changes will be reflected for the first time in income tax expense for the reporting periods included in the year ending January 31, 2019. The effect of the federal income tax rate change on our deferred taxes, a favorable adjustment of approximately $0.8 million, was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment\nRevenues of TRC declined during the year ended January 31, 2018 and it reported operating losses for the year. In our current year third quarter financial filing on Form 10-Q, we alerted stockholders that we may be required to record an impairment loss related to the goodwill of TRC in the fourth quarter of the current year up to an amount of $5.5 million subject to the completion of a full business valuation. TRC's management completed a reforecasting of its future financial results which provided essential data for the required annual goodwill assessment of TRC as of November 1, 2017. The forecast presents a less favorable outlook for TRC than in the past. With the decreased results of Fiscal 2018 and the less favorable outlook for TRC, our full valuation, blending the results of income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nMarket Outlook\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States in each of the last 10 years has not surpassed the total amount generated in the peak power generation year of 2007. For calendar year 2017, the total amount of electricity generation was approximately 97% of the level for 2007. Total electric power generation from all sources has decreased slightly over the past three years. Power demand gains related to economic growth and population increases have been offset by the effects of private electricity generation and energy efficiency advances. However, the base-case outlook recently published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts an annual increase in power generation for 2018 and steady growth through 2050 with average annual increases of a bit less than 1% per year.\nThe share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas in the United States fell from 34% in 2016 to about 32% in 2017 as a result of marginally higher natural gas prices and increased generation from renewables. Coal's generation share remained the same in 2017 as in 2016, about 30%. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the United States to rise from 32% in 2017 to 34% in both 2018 and 2019. The generation share from coal in both 2018 and 2019 is forecast to average 29%, down from 30% in 2017. The nuclear share was 20% in 2017 and is forecast to average 20% in 2018 and 19% in 2019. Non-hydropower renewables (i.e., wind and solar) provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017 and are expected to provide 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019. The generation share of hydropower was over 7% in 2017 and is forecast to fall below 7% in both 2018 and 2019. The EIA also forecasts steady growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.3% per year.\nBetween 2011 and 2016, nearly 60 GW of net coal-fired capacity was retired, partly as a result of new mercury and air-toxics standards. Most of the retired plants were older, smaller, less efficient coal-fired power plants. However, announcements by electric utilities of the retirement of coal-fired power plants continue, citing the availability of cheap natural gas, existing environmental regulations and the significant costs of refurbishment and relicensing. EIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by another 65 GW by 2030, even without adoption of the Clean Power Plan. Almost 5 GW of nuclear capacity has been retired over the last four to five years. The future of new nuclear power plant construction has been further clouded with the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, one of the few major nuclear providers of fuel, services, technology, plant design and equipment. Several utilities have made the decisions to either abandon construction or development of nuclear projects, leaving just one site under construction today (the Vogtle plant units 3 and 4) in the United States.\nThe retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity, and new natural gas-fired plants are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants, and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands. Relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, the benefits of natural gas as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues, power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies.\nCurrent projections of future natural gas-fired power generation assume the sustained increase in domestic natural gas production, which should lead to stable natural gas prices continuing into the future, including the near term. For example, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is forecast to be slightly less in January 2020 than it was in January 2017. The availability of competitively priced natural gas, the significant increases in the efficiency of combined cycle power plants, the existence of certain programs encouraging renewable fuel use, and the implementation of a series of environmental rules, primarily directed toward the reductions of air pollution and the emissions of greenhouse gases, should further reduce future coal use and continue to increase the share of the power generation mix represented by natural gas-fired power plants. By 2050, the base-case of the EIA forecasts that electricity generated by natural gas-fired power plants will represent 35% of the generation mix. It is true that the share of the mix represented by wind farms and solar fields are predicted to grow dramatically with accelerate growth in the near term boosted by extended tax credits; solar photovoltaic growth is predicted to continue throughout the forecast period as costs continue to decrease. Nonetheless, natural gas is predicted to be a top choice for new electricity generation plants in the future primarily due to low natural gas prices and the scheduled expiration of renewable energy tax credits.\nAs a result, we believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are generally favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the continuing retirement of inefficient and old coal and\nnuclear energy plants, should result in natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. In summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the United States should continue to provide construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above.\nWe have been successful in the completion of our EPC and other projects. Our four largest EPC projects continue to progress beyond the peak construction phases of their project life-cycles and toward completion. Consequently, the level of revenues associated with each one will continue to decline.\nWe are disappointed that we did not add a new major EPC contract to our backlog during Fiscal 2018. However, as identified above, we announced in March 2018 that GPS has entered into an EPC services contract with an affiliate of NTE, to construct a 475 MW state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, which is located in Rockingham County. We expect to add the contract value of this project to project backlog in our first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018.\nWe are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC contract to us. With a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC contracting services and with the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our future plans continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 814,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (17.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 892,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 452,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,071\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (14.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 743,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 528,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (70.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,907\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,080\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,763\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (95.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ARGAN, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for the prior year, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for\nthe prior year. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. The percent-complete for these four projects ranged from 83% to 92% as of January 31, 2018.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed last year represented 14% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the United Kingdom.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for the prior year. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in the prior year period associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during the prior year.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for the prior year, as SMC has been successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside premises, including $5.2 million related to a fiber-to-the-home project for a municipal customer, and inside premises projects.\nCost of Revenues\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for"}
