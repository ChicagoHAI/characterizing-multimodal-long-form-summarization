Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law.\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio included 65 properties (127 buildings) with a combined 24.0 million square feet for a total investment of $3.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $3.0 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our overall portfolio was 91.4% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into leases for 4.9 million square feet, including lease renewals for 2.8 million square feet and new leases for 2.1 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 1.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 8.4% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nFollowing our transition from external management to internal management in 2014, our new management team has focused on developing a plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. We undertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio and our operations and have developed a strategy that focuses on reshaping our portfolio over time. We anticipate that as part of this plan, we will dispose properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, our Board of Trustees adopted a strategy to consider disposing of assets that have one or more of the following attributes:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that are less than 150,000 square feet;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that are not office buildings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that are not located in the U.S.; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assets that produce a low cash yield or require significant capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are in the process of executing this strategy and may sell approximately $3.0 billion of assets, depending on market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we exited 68 cities, seven states and one country. For more information regarding the 2015 dispositions, see Note 4 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have generated significant proceeds from the dispositions and have a cash balance of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. We expect to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, redeem preferred shares, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals. However, we may not be able to make acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. If our real estate investments decrease significantly, income from operations may also decline.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to reduce the assets to their estimated fair values. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nAs a result of the taxable losses recognized on property sales in 2015 and the net operating loss carryforward from 2014, a distribution to common shareholders will not be required for 2015. The Board of Trustees has regularly reviewed our dividend policy and will continue to do so, at least annually.\nEffective September 30, 2014, we terminated our business and property management relationships with RMR for our U.S. properties pursuant to a termination and cooperation agreement, which we refer to as the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, through February 28, 2015, RMR and RMR Australia, which we refer to together as Manager, agreed to use best efforts to assist us in the transition of our management and operations. We paid Manager $1.2 million per month for transition services from October 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015, which included continued management and other services for the Australian assets pursuant to an existing management agreement, or the Australia Management Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2015, we agreed to pay Manager $0.1 million per month until we no longer required such services or until the Australia Management Agreement was terminated, which was terminated in the third quarter of 2015, effective October 31, 2015. The $2.7 million incurred pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015, is included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. There is no future obligation to pay any fees to Manager.\nEffective October 1, 2014, we engaged CBRE to provide property management services for our U.S. properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred expenses of $42.7 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $3.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2015 and 2014 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>All Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Comparable Properties(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(2)\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015, and excludes properties sold during the period ended December 31, 2015 and properties classified as discontinued operations for the period ended December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.3 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $156.4 million, or $32.08 per square foot on average (approximately $5.06 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 9.9% of our leased square feet and 10.0% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2016. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2016 are slightly below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2015, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 5, 2015, we prepaid $10.0 million of 7.36% mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted of a prepayment premium and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, net of the write off of an unamortized premium.\nOn June 3, 2015, we defeased the $38.7 million outstanding balance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street. The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 22, 2015, title to 225 Water Street was transferred to the lender pursuant to the consensual foreclosure in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt, with a principal balance of $40.1 million. The transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 1, 2015, we redeemed at par $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 29, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The new credit agreement, which replaced our prior credit agreement and our prior term loan agreement, reduces the interest rate and extends the term of our revolving credit facility and term loan borrowings. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, with two six-month extension options subject to certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively, and have been fully funded. We used the proceeds from the new term loans to repay all amounts outstanding and due under the previous term loan agreement. We do not currently have any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nFor more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see the section captioned Liquidity

We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We refer to the 65 properties (127 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular building where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by non-recurring charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal and litigation costs, partially offset by the internalization of our management, which includes a $9.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense.\nLoss on asset impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. The impairment charge in 2014 includes $22.7 million related to 225 Water Street where we made the decision to cease making loan servicing payments and impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the change in the anticipated holding period for certain properties.\nInterest and other income. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015 and an increase in bank interest income due to a higher average cash balance during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period.\nInterest expense. The decrease in interest expense in the 2015 period primarily reflects the payment of the $235.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility in July 2014, the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, the prepayment of $33.4 million of our 6.40% unsecured notes in September 2014, the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured notes in November 2014 the payment of $100.0 million of our term loan in December 2014, the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 in May 2015, the foreclosure of 225 Water Street in May 2015 and the defeasance of the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center, in August 2015.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure and a $0.6 million gain related to the repayment of mortgage debt at 111 Monument\nCircle, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior notes and a $0.4 million loss related to the new credit agreement entered into in January 2015, which resulted in the termination of our prior credit agreement. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2014 period primarily reflects the write-off of unamortized premiums and deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt at 600 West Chicago Avenue in August 2014, partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured senior notes due 2019.\nGain on sale of equity investments. The gain on sale of equity investments in the 2014 period reflects the sale on July 9, 2014 of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value, partially offset by a loss on the sale of our investment in AIC in May 2014.\nGain on issuance of shares by an equity investee. The gain on issuance of shares by an equity investee primarily reflects the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by SIR during the second quarter of 2014 at prices above our per share carrying value.\nForeign currency exchange loss. The foreign currency exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to the change in foreign currency rates resulting in losses on cash proceeds from the Australian portfolio disposition maintained in an Australian bank account prior to the transfer of cash from our Australian subsidiary to our U.S bank accounts.\nGain on sale of properties. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $27.0 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $22.8 million, $9.5 million, $8.4 million and $4.3 million related to the sales of Arizona Center, One Park Square, 4 South 84th Avenue and One South Church Avenue, respectively.\nThese gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.2 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York and losses in the fourth quarter of $3.1 million and $0.4 million related to the sale of a portfolio in Georgia and the sale of 775 Ridge Lake Boulevard, respectively.\nIncome tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense related to the Australian assets, which were sold in June 2015. The decrease in the foreign tax expense was partially offset by federal income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 incurred as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation.\nEquity in earnings of investees. Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from SIR during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR on July 9, 2014 and our proportionate share of earnings from AIC during the 2014 period prior to the sale of our investment in AIC on May 9, 2014.\nIncome from discontinued operations. In 2015, we adopted ASU 2014-08 and did not classify the properties sold in 2015 as discontinued operations in accordance with this guidance. Income from discontinued operations in the 2014 period relates to 14 properties (43 buildings) sold in 2014.\nLoss on asset impairment from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 14 properties (43 buildings) sold during 2014.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of $11.2 million of 6.14% mortgage debt and $8.5 million of 5.78% mortgage debt in June 2014.\nPreferred distributions. The decrease in preferred distributions reflects the conversion of 10,264,503 of our series D preferred shares into 10,412,499 of our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcess fair value of consideration over carrying value of preferred shares. As a result of the conversion of our series D preferred shares in May 2014, we recorded a preferred distribution of $16.2 million for the excess of the market value of the common shares issued above the carrying value of the series D preferred shares converted.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Table 89: <table><tr><td> </td>

Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include the operating results of 156 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2013. Our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 also includes the operating results of properties owned by SIR when SIR was our consolidated subsidiary, which was until July 2, 2013.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $71.6 million in the 2014 period, compared to the 2013 period, due to a decrease of $77.0 million primarily related to the deconsolidation of SIR discussed above, partially offset by an increase at our comparable properties totaling $5.5 million. The increase in comparable property rental income primarily reflects approximately $8.5 million received\nfrom the settlement of litigation with a former tenant at one of our properties. Rental income includes non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling $12.5 million in the 2014 period and $31.8 million in the 2013 period, which includes $5.7 million related to SIR, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $10.7 million in the 2014 period and $10.3 million in the 2013 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $4.7 million in the 2014 period and $2.8 million in the 2013 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $19.6 million in the 2014 period, compared to the 2013 period, due to a decrease in tenant reimbursements and other income totaling $13.5 million primarily related to the deconsolidation of SIR discussed above, and a decrease in tenant reimbursements and other income at our comparable properties totaling $6.1 million. The decrease in comparable property tenant reimbursements and other income from our comparable properties primarily reflects decreases in real estate taxes and the related tenant reimbursements at some of our properties.\nOperating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses during the 2014 period totaling $22.1 million reflects a decrease in operating expenses totaling $17.2 million primarily related to the deconsolidation of SIR discussed above, and a decrease in operating expenses at our comparable properties totaling $4.9 million. The decrease in operating expenses at our comparable properties primarily reflects decreases in real estate tax assessments and reduced rates in certain markets, partially offset by increases in utility expenses and snow removal costs related to the more severe winter season during the 2014 period, compared to the 2013 period.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $23.4 million for the shareholder approval of reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, $3.6 million of expenses related to the termination and cooperation agreement with RMR, the internalization of our management and an increase of $15.0 million related to business management incentive fees. These increases were partially offset by a $19.6 million decrease related to legal and litigation expenses.\nLoss on asset impairment. The loss on asset impairment in the 2014 period primarily includes impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the change in the anticipated holding period for certain properties and an impairment loss recorded in the second quarter of 2014 on a property for which we made the decision to cease making loan servicing payments. The loss on asset impairment in the 2013 period reflects the write down to estimated fair value, less costs to sell for properties that were being marketed for sale.\nInterest and other income. The increase in interest and other income primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances in the current year.\nInterest expense. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the repurchase of $670.3 million of our unsecured senior notes pursuant to the tender offer we completed in March 2013, the prepayment of $99.0 million of our 5.75% unsecured senior notes in October 2013, the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, the prepayment of $33.4 million of our 6.40% unsecured notes in September 2014, the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured notes in November 2014 and the payment of $100.0 million of our term loan in December 2014.\nGain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2014 period primarily reflects the write-off of unamortized premiums net of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $265.0 million of 5.68% mortgage debt in August 2014, partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees related to the prepayment of $125.0 million of our 7.50% unsecured senior notes due 2019. The loss on early extinguishment of debt in the 2013 period primarily reflects the difference between $726.2 million paid to repurchase $670.3 million of our unsecured senior notes pursuant to the tender offer we completed in March 2013, plus the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees and expenses.\nGain on sale of equity investment. The gain on sale of equity investment in the 2014 period primarily reflects the sale on July 9, 2014 of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value. The gain on sale of equity investments in the 2013 period reflects the sale in March 2013 of all 9,950,000 common shares of GOV that we owned at a per share sales price in excess of our per share carrying value.\nGain on issuance of shares by an equity investee. The gain on issuance of shares by an equity investee primarily reflects the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by SIR during the year ended December 31, 2014 at prices above our per share carrying value.\nGain on sale of properties. Gain on sale of properties in the 2013 period reflects a gain of $1.6 million from an eminent domain land taking at one of our properties.\nIncome tax expense. The increase in income tax expense reflects higher Australian taxable income in the 2014 period as compared to the 2013 period.\nEquity in earnings of investees. Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from SIR and AIC during the 2014 period, and from SIR, GOV and AIC during the 2013 period. The decrease in earnings of investees primarily reflects our proportionate share of earnings from SIR since we began accounting for our investment in SIR using the equity method in July 2013, partially offset by the sale of our entire stake of 22,000,000 common shares of SIR on July 9, 2014, the sale of our investment in AIC on May 9, 2014 and our sale in March 2013 of all 9,950,000 common shares that we owned of GOV.\nIncome from discontinued operations. The increase in income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the decline in depreciation expense from ceasing depreciation when assets are reclassified as held for sale, partially offset by the decline in NOI from 14 properties (43 buildings) that were sold in 2014 and 43 properties (134 buildings) and a land parcel sold during 2013.\nLoss on asset impairment from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 14 properties (43 buildings) sold during 2014. The 2013 loss on asset impairment reflects the write down to estimated fair value less costs to sell for 36 properties (76 buildings) sold during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations. The 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects prepayment premiums and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of $11.2 million of 6.14% mortgage debt and $8.5 million of 5.78% mortgage debt in June 2014. The 2013 loss on early extinguishment of debt reflects the write off of unamortized discount and a prepayment premium associated with the prepayment of $7.1 million of 5.76% mortgage debt in December 2013.\nNet loss on sale of properties from discontinued operations. Net loss on sale of properties in the 2013 period reflects losses totaling $22.2 million from the sale of 43 properties (134 buildings) and a land parcel during the 2013 period.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiary. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiary reflects the noncontrolling portion of income from SIR when SIR was our consolidated subsidiary, which was until July 2, 2013.\nPreferred distributions. The decrease in preferred distributions in the 2014 period reflects the conversion of 10,264,503 of our series D preferred shares into 10,412,499 of our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcess fair value of consideration over carrying value of preferred shares. As a result of the conversion of our series D preferred shares in May 2014, we recorded a preferred distribution of $16.2 million for the excess of the market value of the common shares issued above the carrying value of the series D preferred shares converted.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nTo mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we may enter into additional interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, redeem preferred shares,\nmake distributions, acquire assets, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to control operating and financing cost increases at our properties; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ability to purchase additional properties which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating costs to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating costs to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these costs or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $181.5 million, $1,648.9 million and $(382.7) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $224.4 million, $771.2 million and $(847.0) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2015 and 2014 are primarily related to real estate improvements, our dispositions of properties, the sale of our SIR common shares during the 2014 period, our purchase of our common shares during the 2015 period, our repayments of debt, and our distributions to our common shareholders during the 2014 period.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nIn order to maintain financial flexibility, to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions and investments or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders. On January 29, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The new agreement replaced our prior credit agreement, dated as of August 9, 2010, and our prior term loan agreement, dated as of December 16, 2010. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to two additional periods of six months at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075% of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively. We used the proceeds of borrowings under the credit agreement to repay all amounts outstanding and due under the previous term loan agreement.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2015. We also pay a facility fee of 25 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate spread and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We are allowed to borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 1.68%. As of December 31, 2015, we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nOur term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The interest rate spread is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate for the amounts outstanding under our term loan was 1.83% and 2.23% for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our 5-year and 7-year term loans each had balances of $200.0 million.\nOn December 1, 2015, we repaid at par $116.0 million of 5.24% mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle. On August 3, 2015, we defeased the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center. On June 5, 2015, we prepaid $10.0 million of 7.36% mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South. On June 3, 2015, we defeased the $38.7 million outstanding balance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street. On May 22, 2015, title to 225 Water Street was transferred to the lender pursuant to the consensual foreclosure in full\nsatisfaction of the mortgage debt, with a principal balance of $40.1 million. On May 1, 2015, we redeemed at par $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate of $27.9 million of distributions on our series D and series E preferred shares. On January 26, 2016, we announced that our Board of Trustees declared dividends of $0.40625 per series D preferred share and $0.453125 per series E preferred share, both of which were paid on February 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on February 5, 2016.\nOn August 24, 2015, our Board of Trustees approved a common share repurchase plan, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. On September 14, 2015, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased and retired 3,410,300 of our common shares at a weighted average price of $25.76 per share for a total investment of $87.8 million.\nOur outstanding debt maturities and weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2015, were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Scheduled Principal Payments During Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>Unsecured Floating Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unsecured Fixed Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Secured Fixed Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Interest Rate(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>164,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,064,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,711,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, including net unamortized premiums and discounts, equals $1,710,324.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Weighted based on current contractual interest rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>On February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>We have a mortgage loan with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 2015 of $169,612 secured by 1735 Market Street that matures in 2019.

Also, for further information about our indebtedness, see Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWhen significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility, or as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach, we explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities, extending the maturity of our revolving credit facility and entering into a new revolving credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities.\nWe believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations as they become due. The completion and the costs of our future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular,\nwhether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our credit ratings or our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. For more information regarding these transactions, see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounts capitalized at our properties, including properties sold and properties classified in discontinued operations, and properties owned by SIR when SIR was a consolidated subsidiary of ours, for tenant improvements, leasing costs, building improvements and development and redevelopment activities were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing costs(2)\n</td> <td>44,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements(3)\n</td> <td>21,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Leasing costs include leasing related costs such as brokerage commissions and legal expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets.

Our public debt indenture and related supplements, our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, in excess of calculated amounts, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other financial ratios. At December 31, 2015, we believe we were in compliance with all covenants under our indenture and related supplements, and we believe we were in compliance with all respective covenants under our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement. In addition to our unsecured debt obligations, we had $249.7 million (including net unamortized premiums and discounts) of mortgage notes outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nNone of our indenture and related supplements, our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement, or our mortgage notes contain provisions for acceleration or require us to provide collateral security which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, our senior debt rating is used to determine the interest rate and the fees payable under our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no swaps or hedges as of December 31, 2015, other than the cash flow hedge associated with our $169.6 million of mortgage debt described in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Part II,", "summary": "The report provides a detailed overview of a real estate investment trust (REIT) engaged in owning and operating office buildings in the United States.

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law.\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio included 65 properties (127 buildings) with a combined 24.0 million square feet for a total investment of $3.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $3.0 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our overall portfolio was 91.4% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into leases for 4.9 million square feet, including lease renewals for 2.8 million square feet and new leases for 2.1 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 1.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 8.4% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nFollowing our transition from external management to internal management in 2014, our new management team has focused on developing a plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. We undertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio and our operations and have developed a strategy that focuses on reshaping our portfolio over time. We anticipate that as part of this plan, we will dispose properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, our Board of Trustees adopted a strategy to consider disposing of assets that have one or more of the following attributes:\n \u2022 assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage; \n \u2022 assets that are less than 150,000 square feet; \n \u2022 assets that are not office buildings; \n \u2022 assets that are not located in the U.S.; or \n \u2022 assets that produce a low cash yield or require significant capital expenditures. \nWe are in the process of executing this strategy and may sell approximately $3.0 billion of assets, depending on market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we exited 68 cities, seven states and one country. For more information regarding the 2015 dispositions, see Note 4 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have generated significant proceeds from the dispositions and have a cash balance of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. We expect to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, redeem preferred shares, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals. However, we may not be able to make acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. If our real estate investments decrease significantly, income from operations may also decline.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to reduce the assets to their estimated fair values. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nAs a result of the taxable losses recognized on property sales in 2015 and the net operating loss carryforward from 2014, a distribution to common shareholders will not be required for 2015. The Board of Trustees has regularly reviewed our dividend policy and will continue to do so, at least annually.\nEffective September 30, 2014, we terminated our business and property management relationships with RMR for our U.S. properties pursuant to a termination and cooperation agreement, which we refer to as the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, through February 28, 2015, RMR and RMR Australia, which we refer to together as Manager, agreed to use best efforts to assist us in the transition of our management and operations. We paid Manager $1.2 million per month for transition services from October 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015, which included continued management and other services for the Australian assets pursuant to an existing management agreement, or the Australia Management Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2015, we agreed to pay Manager $0.1 million per month until we no longer required such services or until the Australia Management Agreement was terminated, which was terminated in the third quarter of 2015, effective October 31, 2015. The $2.7 million incurred pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015, is included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. There is no future obligation to pay any fees to Manager.\nEffective October 1, 2014, we engaged CBRE to provide property management services for our U.S. properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred expenses of $42.7 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $3.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2015 and 2014 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n (1) Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015, and excludes properties sold during the period ended December 31, 2015 and properties classified as discontinued operations for the period ended December 31, 2014. \n (2) Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.3 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $156.4 million, or $32.08 per square foot on average (approximately $5.06 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 9.9% of our leased square feet and 10.0% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2016. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2016 are slightly below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2015, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Square feet is pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2015, and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \n (2) Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2015, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, free rent periods, and parking revenue. \n (3) Square footage expiring in 2016 includes 0.1 million square feet related to month-to-month and self storage tenants. Annualized rental revenue expiring in 2016 includes $3.3 million of month-to-month and self storage rent. \nA principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties. Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance, except from our government tenants, who usually pay rents monthly in arrears. As of December 31, 2015, tenants representing 1% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n (1) Square footage is pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2015, and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \n (2) Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2015, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, free rent periods, and parking revenue. \n (3) Groupon, Inc. statistics include 207,536 square feet that are sublet from Bankers Life and Casualty Company. \n (4) Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Carmike Cinemas' lease was extended. The weighted average remaining lease term is 14.7 years. \nFinancing Activities\nOn December 1, 2015, we repaid at par the $116.0 million of 5.24% mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the write-off of an unamortized premium, net of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nOn August 3, 2015, we defeased the $141.4 million outstanding balance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in Illinois Center. The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 5, 2015, we prepaid $10.0 million of 7.36% mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted of a prepayment premium and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, net of the write off of an unamortized premium.\nOn June 3, 2015, we defeased the $38.7 million outstanding balance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street. The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 22, 2015, title to 225 Water Street was transferred to the lender pursuant to the consensual foreclosure in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt, with a principal balance of $40.1 million. The transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 1, 2015, we redeemed at par $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 29, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The new credit agreement, which replaced our prior credit agreement and our prior term loan agreement, reduces the interest rate and extends the term of our revolving credit facility and term loan borrowings. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, with two six-month extension options subject to certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively, and have been fully funded. We used the proceeds from the new term loans to repay all amounts outstanding and due under the previous term loan agreement. We do not currently have any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nFor more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see the section captioned Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\u201d below.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 \n (1) Comparable properties consist of 65 properties (127 buildings) owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. \n (2) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (3) During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized non-recurring charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue. \n (4) We calculate net operating income, or NOI, as shown above. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.  We refer to the 65 properties (127 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular building where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by non-recurring charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law.\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio included 65 properties (127 buildings) with a combined 24.0 million square feet for a total investment of $3.9 billion at cost and a depreciated book value of $3.0 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our overall portfolio was 91.4% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into leases for 4.9 million square feet, including lease renewals for 2.8 million square feet and new leases for 2.1 million square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 1.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 8.4% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nFollowing our transition from external management to internal management in 2014, our new management team has focused on developing a plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. We undertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio and our operations and have developed a strategy that focuses on reshaping our portfolio over time. We anticipate that as part of this plan, we will dispose properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, our Board of Trustees adopted a strategy to consider disposing of assets that have one or more of the following attributes:\n \u2022 assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage; \n \u2022 assets that are less than 150,000 square feet; \n \u2022 assets that are not office buildings; \n \u2022 assets that are not located in the U.S.; or \n \u2022 assets that produce a low cash yield or require significant capital expenditures. \nWe are in the process of executing this strategy and may sell approximately $3.0 billion of assets, depending on market conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we exited 68 cities, seven states and one country. For more information regarding the 2015 dispositions, see Note 4 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have generated significant proceeds from the dispositions and have a cash balance of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. We expect to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, redeem preferred shares, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals. However, we may not be able to make acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. If our real estate investments decrease significantly, income from operations may also decline.\nAs part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to reduce the assets to their estimated fair values. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.2 million in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.\nAs a result of the taxable losses recognized on property sales in 2015 and the net operating loss carryforward from 2014, a distribution to common shareholders will not be required for 2015. The Board of Trustees has regularly reviewed our dividend policy and will continue to do so, at least annually.\nEffective September 30, 2014, we terminated our business and property management relationships with RMR for our U.S. properties pursuant to a termination and cooperation agreement, which we refer to as the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, through February 28, 2015, RMR and RMR Australia, which we refer to together as Manager, agreed to use best efforts to assist us in the transition of our management and operations. We paid Manager $1.2 million per month for transition services from October 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015, which included continued management and other services for the Australian assets pursuant to an existing management agreement, or the Australia Management Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2015, we agreed to pay Manager $0.1 million per month until we no longer required such services or until the Australia Management Agreement was terminated, which was terminated in the third quarter of 2015, effective October 31, 2015. The $2.7 million incurred pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015, is included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements. There is no future obligation to pay any fees to Manager.\nEffective October 1, 2014, we engaged CBRE to provide property management services for our U.S. properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred expenses of $42.7 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $3.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy data for 2015 and 2014 are as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>All Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Comparable Properties(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(2)\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015, and excludes properties sold during the period ended December 31, 2015 and properties classified as discontinued operations for the period ended December 31, 2014. \n (2) Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. \nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.3 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $156.4 million, or $32.08 per square foot on average (approximately $5.06 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 9.9% of our leased square feet and 10.0% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2016. Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2016 are slightly below market.

The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn June 5, 2015, we prepaid $10.0 million of 7.36% mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which consisted of a prepayment premium and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, net of the write off of an unamortized premium.\nOn June 3, 2015, we defeased the $38.7 million outstanding balance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street. The defeasance costs and write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs, net of the write off of the unamortized premium, resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 22, 2015, title to 225 Water Street was transferred to the lender pursuant to the consensual foreclosure in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt, with a principal balance of $40.1 million. The transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn May 1, 2015, we redeemed at par $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 29, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The new credit agreement, which replaced our prior credit agreement and our prior term loan agreement, reduces the interest rate and extends the term of our revolving credit facility and term loan borrowings. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, with two six-month extension options subject to certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively, and have been fully funded. We used the proceeds from the new term loans to repay all amounts outstanding and due under the previous term loan agreement.

65 properties (127 buildings) owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. \n (2) Other properties consist of properties sold. \n (3) During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized non-recurring charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue. \n (4) We calculate net operating income, or NOI, as shown above. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.  We refer to the 65 properties (127 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, as comparable properties. We refer to the sold properties as other properties. Our consolidated statements of operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the operating results of 65 properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2014.\nRental income. Rental income decreased $121.3 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period, primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our comparable properties increased $1.2 million primarily due to an increase in the recognition of lease termination fees and increases due to the write offs in 2014 of an acquired real estate lease after a tenant vacated its space prior to the lease expiration and of a deferred rent receivable after a tenant contracted its lease space. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular building where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms. In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term. The increase in rental income was also partially offset by non-recurring charges against revenues of $2.7 million related to a parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental income includes increases for non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling $5.3 million in the 2015 period and $12.5 million in the 2014 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $7.5 million in the 2015 period and $10.6 million in the 2014 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $8.2 million in the 2015 period and $4.7 million in the 2014 period.\nTenant reimbursements and other income. Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased $25.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to the 2014 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and a $1.3 million decrease at our comparable properties primarily resulting from non-recurring prior year utility expense reimbursement.\nOperating expenses. The $63.0 million decrease in operating expenses during the 2015 period as compared to the 2014 period is primarily due to the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase at our comparable properties. The increase in operating expenses at the comparable properties primarily reflects increases in real estate tax expense related to increases in assessed values, bad debt expense primarily due to an evicted tenant, property related legal fees, maintenance and repairs, HVAC expenses and cleaning expenses, partially offset by decreases in management fees and increases in real estate tax refunds in 2015 related to prior year real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2015 period when compared to the 2014 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the leasing transactions discussed above, where due to one tenant vacating its space and two other tenants shortening their remaining lease term, the corresponding tenant improvements were written off or depreciation was accelerated.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to $43.9 million of business management and incentive fees paid to our prior external manager in 2014, a $14.5 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, and a $9.4 million decrease in legal"}
