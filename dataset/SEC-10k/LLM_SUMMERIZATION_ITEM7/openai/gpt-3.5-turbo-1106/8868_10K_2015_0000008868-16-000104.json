MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share and share data)\nYou should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained in our 2015 Annual Report. When used in this discussion, the terms \"Avon,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on pages 29 through 31 of this MD&A for a description of how Constant dollar (\"Constant $\") growth rates (a Non-GAAP financial measure) are determined.\nOverview\nWe are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. During 2015, we had sales operations in 57 countries and territories, and distributed products in 15 more. In addition, in our North America business (which has been presented as discontinued operations) we had sales operations in 3 countries and territories, and distributed our products in 27 other countries and territories. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations and include commercial business units in Latin America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific. In addition, we operate our business in North America, which has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and is discussed further below. Our product categories are Beauty and Fashion & Home. Beauty consists of skincare (which includes personal care), fragrance and color (cosmetics). Fashion & Home consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children's products and nutritional products. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had nearly 6 million active Representatives which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. During 2015, all of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside of the U.S.\nIn December 2015, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management (\"Cerberus\"), which include a $435 investment in Avon by an affiliate of Cerberus through the purchase of our convertible preferred stock and the separation of the North America business from Avon into a privately-held company, which will include a $100 contribution by Avon, that will be majority-owned and managed by an affiliate of Cerberus. Avon will retain approximately 20% ownership in this new privately-held company. These transactions are expected to close concurrently in the first half of 2016. The North America business, which represents the Company's operations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, was previously its own reportable segment and has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the investment by an affiliate of Cerberus and the separation of the North America business.\nTotal revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 declined 19% compared to the prior-year period, due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue increased 2%. Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points due to taxes in Brazil from the combined impact of the recognition of Value Added Tax (\"VAT\") credits in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 along with a new Industrial Productions Tax (\"IPI\") on cosmetics which went into effect in May 2015. Constant $ revenue was also negatively impacted by approximately 1 point as a result of the sale of Liz Earle which was completed in July 2015. Sales from the Beauty category decreased 20%, or increased 3% on a Constant $ basis. Sales from the Fashion & Home category decreased 15%, or increased 5% on a Constant $ basis.\nOur Constant $ revenue benefited from growth in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), which contributed approximately 2 points to our Constant $ revenue growth. Our Constant $ revenue also benefited from growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine), and to a lesser extent, South Africa and underlying growth in Brazil. Constant $ revenue benefited from higher average order and a 1% increase in Active Representatives. The increase in Active Representatives was primarily due to growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Russia, which was primarily due to sustained momentum in recruitment and retention, partially offset by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina). The net impact of price and mix increased 4%, driven by increases in all regions. The net impact of price and mix was primarily positively impacted by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), as these markets benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing. Units sold decreased 2%, primarily due to declines in units sold in Brazil and Venezuela, partially offset by an increase in units sold in Russia. See \"Segment Review\" of this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment.\nOver the last two years, our profitability has suffered significantly given our geographic footprint and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of key Avon markets. As a result, our revenue and profits have been reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins have been negatively impacted by country mix, as certain of our markets which have historically had higher operating margins experienced significant devaluation of their local currency. In addition, as our sales and costs are often denominated in different currencies, this has created a negative foreign currency transaction impact. Specifically, as compared to the prior-year period, foreign currency has impacted our consolidated financial results as a result of foreign currency transaction losses (classified within cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses), which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of an estimated $210, foreign currency translation, which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of approximately $265 (of which approximately $90 related to Venezuela, as discussed further below), and lower foreign exchange losses on our working capital (classified within other expense, net), which had a favorable impact of approximately $10 before tax.\nIn November 2015, we announced an internal reorganization of our management structure, including the combined management of Latin America and Europe, Middle East & Africa, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the internal reorganization, we will report results for the following four reportable segments beginning in the first quarter of 2016: Europe, Middle East & Africa; Northern Latin America; South America; and Asia Pacific.\nIn January 2016, we announced a transformation plan (the \"Transformation Plan\"), which includes investing in growth, reducing costs in an effort to continue to improve our cost structure and improving our financial resilience. As a result of this plan, we expect to invest $350 into the business over the next three years with an estimated $150 in media and social selling and $200 related to the service model evolution and information technology, which will be aimed at improving the overall Representative experience. With respect to cost reductions, we have targeted pre-tax annualized cost savings of approximately $350 after three years, with an estimated $200 from supply chain reductions and an estimated $150 from other cost reductions. These cost savings are expected to be achieved through restructuring actions as well as other cost-savings strategies that will not result in restructuring charges. We are targeting the realization of $70 of these pre-tax cost savings in 2016. We have initiated this Transformation Plan in order to enable us to achieve our long-term goals of double-digit operating margin and mid single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth. While we expect to evaluate options to improve our financial resilience, we have already implemented actions in this area, including refinancing our revolving credit facility, divesting Liz Earle Beauty Co. Limited (\"Liz Earle\"), prepaying our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Capital Resources\" on pages 58 through 59) and suspending our dividend.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report and Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our Annual Report for more information on these items.\nIn July 2015, we sold Liz Earle, and as a result, we expect Avon's Constant $ and reported revenue in 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately 1 point. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced that the SICAD II market would no longer be available, and a new foreign exchange system was created, referred to as the SIMADI exchange (\"SIMADI\"). SIMADI began operating on February 12, 2015. Use of the SIMADI exchange rate caused the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 70%. In addition, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $11 to cost of sales and approximately $90 to selling, general and administrative expenses in order to reflect the write-down of inventory and long-lived assets, respectively, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We recognized an additional negative impact of approximately $19 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 due to the recognition of the cost basis at a higher exchange rate than the rate at which revenue was reported in U.S. dollars. In addition to the negative impact to operating margin, we recorded an after-tax benefit of approximately $3 (a benefit of approximately $4 in other expense, net, and a loss of approximately $1 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" of this MD&A for further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nInformation relating to new accounting standards is included in Note 2, New Accounting Standards, to our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2015 Annual Report.\nPerformance Metrics\nWithin this MD&A, in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue, operating profit and operating margin, we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Metrics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Definition\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Active Representatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>This metric is a measure of Representative activity based on the number of unique Representatives submitting at least one order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. To determine the change in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Orders in China are excluded from this metric as our business in China is predominantly retail. Liz Earle was also excluded from this calculation as it did not distribute through the direct-selling channel.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in units sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>This metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and products contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or discount purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Average Order\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>This metric is a measure of Representative productivity. The calculation is the difference of the year-over-year change in revenue on a Constant $ basis and the Change in Active Representatives. Change in Average Order may be impacted by a combination of factors such as inflation, units, product mix, and/or pricing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, including changes in: revenue, operating profit, Adjusted operating profit, operating margin and Adjusted operating margin. We also refer to these adjusted financial measures as Constant $ items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current-year results and prior-year results at a constant exchange rate. Foreign currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant-currency growth rates.\nWe also present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, total and net global expenses, operating profit, operating margin and effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a Non-GAAP basis. We refer to these Non-GAAP financial measures as \"Adjusted.\" We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the Non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement (\"CTI\") restructuring initiatives, 2) costs and charges related to the devaluations of Venezuelan currency in February 2015, March 2014 and February 2013, combined with being designated as a highly inflationary economy, and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela (\"Venezuelan special items\"), 3) the $89 accrual recorded in 2013 for the settlements related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") investigations, the additional $46 accrual in 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the associated approximate $19 net tax benefit (\"FCPA accrual\"), 4) the settlement charges associated with the U.S. pension plan (\"Pension settlement charge\"), 5) the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business, and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business (\"Asset impairment and other charges\"), 6) various other items associated with the sale of Liz Earle, the separation of the North America business and debt-related charges (\"Other items\") and, as it relates to our effective tax rate discussion, 7) the non-cash income tax adjustments associated with our deferred tax assets recorded in 2015 and 2014, and an income tax benefit realized as a result of tax planning strategies (\"Special tax items\"). The Company believes investors find the Non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. These Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 caused by the devaluations of Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and non-monetary assets, such as inventories. For non-monetary assets, the Venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical U.S. dollar cost of the assets at the previous\nexchange rate and the revised exchange rate. In 2015 and 2014, the Venezuelan special items also include adjustments of approximately $11 and approximately $116, respectively, to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value. In 2015, the Venezuelan special items also include an impairment charge of approximately $90 to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value. In 2013, the devaluation was as a result of the change in the official exchange rate, which moved from 4.30 to 6.30. In 2014, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the official exchange rate of 6.30 to the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50. In 2015, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50 to the SIMADI exchange rate of approximately 170. The Venezuelan special items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nThe Pension settlement charge includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014 associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Such payments fully settle our pension plan obligation to those participants who elected to receive such payment.\nThe Asset impairment and other charges include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Asset impairment and other charges also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business in 2013.\nThe Other items include the impact during 2015 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to the gain on the sale of Liz Earle. The Other items also includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 caused by transaction-related costs of $3.1 associated with the planned separation of the North America business that were included in continuing operations. In addition, Other items includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the loss on extinguishment of debt caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts associated with the prepayment of our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Other items also include the impact on other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $2.5 associated with the write-off of issuance costs related to our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility. The Other items, in 2013, also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the prepayment of our private notes issued in 2010, as well as the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the early repayment of $380 of the outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement. The Other items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2013 caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, partially offset by a deferred gain associated with the January 2013 interest-rate swap agreement termination, associated with the prepayment of the notes due in 2014.\nIn addition, the effective tax rate discussion includes Special tax items which include the impact during 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge in the first quarter of 2015 and a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2015, each associated with valuation allowances, to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that was \"more likely than not\" to be realized. These adjustments were primarily caused by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets. The Special tax items also include the impact during the third quarter of 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge as a result of establishing a valuation allowance for the full amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets due to the impact of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and its associated effect on our tax planning strategies. Additionally, the Special tax items includes the impact on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge associated with valuation allowances, to adjust certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. The non-U.S. valuation allowance included an adjustment associated with Russia, which was primarily the result of lower earnings, which were significantly impacted by foreign exchange losses on working capital balances. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2014 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge primarily associated with a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized, and was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and, to a lesser extent, the finalization of the FCPA settlements. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2015 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to an income tax benefit recognized as a result of the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Results Of Operations - Consolidated\" below, \"Segment Review - Latin America\" below, Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expense\" below, Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015\nAnnual Report, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below, Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, and Note 7, Income Taxes on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on these items.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nRepresentatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a three- to four-week duration. The Representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to us during each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances, including seasonality and changing trends. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense was $144 in 2015, $171 in 2014 and $209 in 2013, or approximately 2% of total revenue in each year. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collection of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nAllowances for Sales Returns\nPolicies and practices for product returns vary by jurisdiction, but within many jurisdictions, we generally allow an unlimited right of return. We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, annual sales returns were $191 for 2015, $241 for 2014 and $274 for 2013, or approximately 3% of total revenue in each year, which has been generally in line with our expectations. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required.\nProvisions for Inventory Obsolescence\nWe record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $45 in 2015, $78 in 2014 and $82 in 2013.\nPension and Postretirement Expense\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and a portion of employees in international locations. However, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is closed to employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care benefits subject to certain limitations to many retired employees in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on our benefit plans.\nPension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are generally reviewed and determined on an annual basis. These assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations, the rate of compensation increase of plan participants and mortality rates. We use a December 31 measurement date for all of our employee benefit plans.\nFor 2015, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 6.87%, as compared with 6.86% for 2014. In determining the long-term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans' investments, an expectation for the plans' investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary.\nAs part of the separation of the North America business, we will transfer certain pension liabilities under the U.S. defined benefit pension plan associated with current and former employees of the North America business and certain other former Avon employees, along with a portion of the assets held by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, to a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the new privately-held company. We will also transfer certain other postretirement liabilities (namely, retiree medical and supplemental pension liabilities) in respect of such employees and former employees. We will continue to retain certain U.S. pension and other postretirement liabilities primarily associated with employees who are actively employed by Avon outside of the North America business. Prior to this separation, our net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were allocated between Discontinued Operations and Global and Other Expenses as the plan includes both North America and U.S. Corporate Avon associates. In line with this allocation, our ongoing net periodic benefit costs within Global and Other Expenses are not expected to be materially impacted by the separation of the North America business.\nBeginning in 2014, we adopted an investment strategy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan which is designed to match the movements in the pension liability through an increased allocation towards debt securities. In addition, we also have begun to utilize derivative instruments to achieve the desired market exposures or to hedge certain risks. Derivative instruments may include, but are not limited to, futures, options, swaps or swaptions. Investment types, including the use of derivatives are based on written guidelines established for each investment manager and monitored by the plan's investment committee. In 2015, similar investment strategies were implemented in some of our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nA significant portion of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2015 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan was 7.25%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 70% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 3% to 5% in the long-term) and approximately 30% in equity securities and high yield securities (which are expected to earn approximately 5% to 7% in the long term). In addition to the physical assets, the asset portfolio has derivative instruments which increase our exposure to higher yielding securities. Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan were approximately 8% for the most recent 10-year period and approximately 8% for the 20-year period. In the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, our asset allocation policy has historically favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned approximately 7% over the 10-year period and approximately 8% over the 20-year period. The rate of return on the plan assets in the U.S. was approximately negative 3% in 2015 and approximately 11% in 2014.\nThe discount rate used for determining the present value of future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of bonds that receive a high-quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high-quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted-average discount rate for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans determined on this basis was 3.92% at December 31, 2015, and 3.54% at December 31, 2014. For the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate, we take external actuarial advice into consideration.\nOur funding requirements may be impacted by standards and regulations or interpretations thereof. Our calculations of pension and postretirement costs are dependent on the use of assumptions, including discount rates, hybrid plan maximum interest crediting rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above, rate of compensation increase of plan participants, interest cost, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, mortality rates, the number of participants and certain demographics and\nother factors. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2015, we had pretax actuarial losses and prior service credits totaling approximately $296 for the U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and approximately $238 for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that have not yet been charged to expense, of which approximately $247 of the U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are associated with discontinued operations. These actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") within shareholders' equity. While we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense. For 2016, our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is 7.00% for our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and 6.40% for our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis.\nA 50 basis point change (in either direction) in the expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases, would have had approximately the following effect on 2015 pension expense and the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2015:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\nPension Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) in\nPension Obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50 Basis Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50 Basis Point\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table reflects the entire U.S. pension and postretirement plans, a portion of which are associated with discontinued operations.\nRestructuring Reserves\nWe record the estimated expense for our restructuring initiatives when such costs are deemed probable and estimable, when approved by the appropriate corporate authority and by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans. These expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits, impairment or accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, and any other qualifying exit costs. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel. Such costs represent our best estimate, but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time, including attrition rates. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine whether an adjustment is required.\nTaxes\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. Evaluating the need for and quantifying the valuation allowance often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all the weighted positive and negative evidence available to the Company in order to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In performing this analysis, the Company's forecasted domestic and foreign taxable income, and the existence of potential prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would enable the Company to utilize some or all of its excess foreign tax credits, were taken into consideration. At December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $151 (net of valuation allowances of $1,972).\nWith respect to our deferred tax assets, at December 31, 2015, we had recognized deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards of $657, primarily from foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions, for which a valuation allowance of $652 has been provided. Prior to December 31, 2015, we had recognized deferred tax assets of $746 relating to excess U.S. foreign tax and other U.S. general business credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance of $746 has been provided. We have a history of domestic source losses, and our excess U.S. foreign tax and general business credits have primarily resulted from having a greater domestic source loss in recent years which reduces our ability to credit foreign taxes or utilize the general business credits which we generate.\nOur ability to realize our U.S. deferred tax assets, such as our foreign tax and general business credit carryforwards, is dependent on future U.S. taxable income within the carryforward period. At December 31, 2015, we would need to generate approximately $2.1 billion of excess net foreign source income in order to realize the U.S. foreign tax and general business credits before they expire.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company's expected net foreign source income was reduced significantly, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies for some of our key markets and, to a lesser extent, the finalization of the FCPA settlements. This strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced the expected dividends and royalties that could be remitted\nto the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries, particularly Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. The effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, including the repatriation of foreign earnings and the acceleration of royalties from our foreign subsidiaries, was also negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In addition, the finalization of the FCPA settlements, which included a $68 fine related to Avon China in connection with the DOJ settlement and $67 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest related to Avon Products, Inc. in connection with the SEC settlement, negatively impacted expected future repatriation of foreign earnings and reduced current U.S. taxable income, respectively. As a result of these developments, we determined that we may not generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. As such, we recorded a valuation allowance of $441 to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized, of which $367 was recorded to income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the remainder was recorded to various components of other comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company recorded a $31 charge and a $3 benefit, respectively, associated with valuation allowances, to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that was more likely than not\u201d to be realized. These adjustments were primarily caused by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an additional valuation allowance for the remaining U.S. deferred tax assets of $642. The increase in the valuation allowance resulted from reduced tax benefits expected to be obtained from tax planning strategies associated with an anticipated accelerated receipt in the U.S. of foreign source income. As the U.S. dollar had further strengthened against currencies of some of our key markets during the third quarter of 2015, the benefits associated with the Company's tax planning strategies were no longer sufficient for the Company to continue to conclude that its tax planning strategies were prudent. In the absence of any alternative prudent tax planning strategies and other sources of future taxable income, it was determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded. Although the Company continues to expect that it will generate taxable income and tax liability in the U.S., the Company is expected to offset its current and future tax liability with foreign tax credits, and as a result, the expected level of future taxable income and tax liability is not adequate to realize the benefit of previously recorded deferred tax assets. Although the Company may not be able to recognize a financial statement benefit associated with its deferred tax assets, the Company will continue to manage and plan for the utilization of its deferred tax assets to avoid the expiration of deferred tax assets that may have limited lives.\nAt December 31, 2015, we continue to assert that our foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested, as a result of our domestic liquidity profile. Accordingly, we adjusted our deferred tax liability to account for our 2015 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and for the tax effect of earnings that were actually repatriated to the U.S. during the year. The net impact on the deferred tax liability associated with the Company's undistributed earnings is an increase of $75, resulting in a deferred tax liability balance of $89 related to the incremental tax cost on $1.4 billion of undistributed foreign earnings at December 31, 2015. This deferred income tax liability amount is net of the estimated foreign tax credits that would be generated upon the repatriation of such earnings. The repatriation of foreign earnings may result in the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credits in the year of repatriation; therefore, the utilization of foreign tax credits is dependent on the amount and timing of repatriations, as well as the jurisdictions involved. We have not included the undistributed earnings of our subsidiary in Venezuela in the calculation of this deferred income tax liability as local regulations restrict cash distributions denominated in U.S. dollars.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a benefit of approximately $19 associated with the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies. We completed the implementation of these tax planning strategies and expect to recognize an additional benefit of approximately $30 in the first quarter of 2016.\nWith respect to our uncertain tax positions, we recognize the benefit of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In 2016, a number of open tax years are scheduled to close due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed. If our tax positions are ultimately upheld or denied, it is possible that the 2016 provision for income taxes, as well as tax related cash receipts or payments, may be impacted.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable. We record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation, which, by its nature is unpredictable. We\nbelieve that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable, but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue, our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect, which could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Assets\nPlant, Property and Equipment and Capitalized Software\nWe evaluate our plant, property and equipment and capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nIn February 2015, we reviewed Avon Venezuela's long-lived assets to determine whether the carrying amount of the assets was recoverable. Based on our expected cash flows associated with the asset group, we determined that the carrying amount of the assets, carried at their historical U.S. dollar cost basis, was not recoverable. As such, an impairment charge of $90.3 to selling, general and administrative expenses was recorded to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value of $15.7, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. The fair value of Avon Venezuela's long-lived assets was determined using both market and cost valuation approaches. The valuation analysis performed required several estimates, including market conditions and inflation rates. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on Avon Venezuela.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, and more frequently if circumstances warrant, using various fair value methods. We review finite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for 2015 and determined that the estimated fair values were considered substantially in excess of the carrying values of each of our reporting units, with the exception of our Egypt reporting unit (discussed below).\nThe impairment analyses performed for goodwill and intangible assets require several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and a finite-lived intangible asset. As part of our goodwill impairment analysis, we typically use a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit, which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business, and is most consistent with the approach that we would generally expect a market participant would use. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units utilizing a DCF approach, we typically forecast revenue and the resulting cash flows for periods of five to ten years and include an estimated terminal value at the end of the forecasted period. When determining the appropriate forecast period for the DCF approach, we consider the amount of time required before the reporting unit achieves what we consider a normalized, sustainable level of cash flows. The estimation of fair value utilizing a DCF approach includes numerous uncertainties which require significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates, as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions, and the structure that would yield the highest economic value, among other factors.\nEgypt\nDuring the 2015 year-end close process, our analysis of the Egypt business indicated an impairment as the carrying value of the business exceeded the estimated fair value. This was primarily the result of reducing our long-term projections of the business. During 2015, Egypt performed generally in line with our revenue and earnings projections, which assumed growth as compared to 2014. However, as a result of currency restrictions for the payment of goods in Egypt, we lowered our long-term revenue and earnings projections for the business. Accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $6.9 was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill. There is no amount remaining associated with goodwill for our Egypt reporting unit as a result of this impairment charge.\nChina\nDuring the first half of 2013, China performed generally in line with our revenue and earnings projections. As assumed in our projections, China's revenue in the first half of 2013 continued to deteriorate versus the prior-year period; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2013, this revenue decline was significantly in excess of our assumptions. As a result, in the third quarter of 2013, it became apparent that we would not achieve our 2013 and long-term forecasted revenue and earnings, and we completed an interim impairment assessment of the fair value of goodwill related to our operations in China. The revenue decline in China during the third quarter of 2013 resulted in the recognition of an operating loss while we had expected\noperating profit in our projections. In the third quarter of 2013, we significantly lowered our long-term revenue and earnings projections for China that was included in our DCF model utilized in our interim impairment assessment. As a result of our impairment testing, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $42.1 in the third quarter of 2013 to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets. There are no amounts remaining associated with goodwill or intangible assets for our China reporting unit as a result of this impairment charge.\nKey Assumptions - Egypt and China\nKey assumptions used in measuring the fair value of Egypt and China during these impairment assessments included projections of revenue and the resulting cash flows, as well as the discount rate (based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital). To estimate the fair value of Egypt and China, we forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows over five years and ten years, respectively, using a DCF model which included a terminal value at the end of the projection period. We believed that a five-year period and a ten-year period was a reasonable amount of time in order to return cash flows of Egypt and China, respectively, to normalized, sustainable levels.\nSee Note

Constant $ revenue increased 2%. Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points due to taxes in Brazil from the combined impact of the recognition of VAT credits in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 along with a new IPI tax on cosmetics which went into effect in May 2015. Constant $ revenue was also negatively impacted by approximately 1 point as a result of the sale of Liz Earle which was completed in July 2015. Our Constant $ revenue benefited from growth in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), which contributed approximately 2 points to our Constant $ revenue growth. Our Constant $ revenue also benefited from growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine), and to a lesser extent, South Africa and underlying growth in Brazil. Constant $ revenue benefited from higher average order and a 1% increase in Active Representatives. The increase in Active Representatives was primarily due to growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Russia, which was primarily due to sustained momentum in recruitment and retention, partially offset by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina). The net impact of price and mix increased 4%, driven by increases in all regions. The net impact of price and mix was primarily positively impacted by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), as these markets benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing. Units sold decreased 2%, primarily due to declines in units sold in Brazil and Venezuela, partially offset by an increase in units sold in Russia. See \"Segment Review\" in this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment and \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of the tax benefits in Brazil.\nOn a category basis, our net sales and associated growth rates were as follows: Table 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/Point Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beauty:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Skincare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,791.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,281.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fragrance\n</td> <td>1,632.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,966.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Color\n</td> <td>1,078.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,365.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Beauty\n</td> <td>4,502.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,612.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fashion & Home:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fashion\n</td> <td>907.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,040.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home\n</td> <td>666.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>819.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fashion & Home\n</td> <td>1,574.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,860.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,076.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,472.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin and Adjusted operating margin decreased 300 basis points and 360 basis points, respectively, compared to 2014. The decrease in Adjusted operating margin includes the benefits associated with the restructuring actions taken during 2015 and the $400M Cost Savings Initiative, primarily reductions in headcount, as well as other cost reductions. The decrease in operating margin and Adjusted operating margin are discussed further below in \"Gross Margin,\" \"Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\" and \"Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nGross Margin\nGross margin and Adjusted gross margin decreased 40 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, compared to 2014. The gross margin comparison was impacted by a lower negative impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, as approximately $29 was recognized in the current-year period as compared to approximately $121 in the prior-year period, primarily associated with adjustments to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nThe decrease of 150 basis points in Adjusted gross margin was primarily due to the following:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of approximately 270 basis points due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction losses and foreign currency translation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of 40 basis points associated with the net impact of VAT credits in Brazil recognized in revenue in 2014 that did not recur in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of 20 basis points as a result of the IPI tax law on cosmetics in Brazil that went into effect in May 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These items were partially offset by the following:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of 130 basis points due to the favorable net impact of mix and pricing, primarily in Latin America, which includes the realization of price increases in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of approximately 60 basis points due to lower supply chain costs, primarily in Europe, Middle East & Africa which was largely due to lower overhead costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The negative impact of foreign currency transaction losses was partially mitigated by the benefits of pricing as we realized the impact of inflation in certain of our markets.\nSee \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of the VAT credits and IPI tax law in Brazil.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased approximately $664 compared to 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many of our foreign currencies resulted in lower reported selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is also due to the additional $46 accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and a lower amount of CTI restructuring. Partially offsetting the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was an approximate $90 impairment charge recorded in 2015 to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, higher Representative, sales leader and field expense, higher foreign currency transaction costs and higher expenses associated with long-term employee incentive compensation plans as the prior-year period includes the benefit from the reversal of such accruals that did not recur in the current-year period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 250 basis points and 220 basis points, respectively, compared to 2014. In the current-year period, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was impacted by an approximate $90 impairment charge recorded in 2015 to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, the approximate $7 aggregate settlement charges associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, approximately $3 of transaction-related costs associated with the separation of North America that were included in continuing operations, and approximately $1 associated with our Venezuela operations for certain non-monetary assets carried at the historical U.S. dollar cost following the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting. In the prior-year period, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was impacted by the additional $46 accrual recorded in 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations that did not recur\nin 2015, approximately $16 associated with our Venezuela operations for certain non-monetary assets carried at the historical U.S. dollar cost following the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, and the approximate $10 aggregate settlement charges associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, the selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue comparison was impacted by lower CTI restructuring as compared to the prior-year period.\nSee \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A and Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations, Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on the FCPA investigations, \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expenses\" in this MD&A and Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion of the pension settlement charges, and Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on CTI restructuring.\nThe increase of 220 basis points in Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the following:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of approximately 210 basis points due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and foreign currency transaction losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of 60 basis points associated with the net impact of VAT credits in Brazil recognized in revenue in 2014 that did not recur in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of 60 basis points as a result of the IPI tax law on cosmetics in Brazil, which reduced revenue as we did not raise the prices paid by Representatives to the same extent as the IPI tax; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of 40 basis points due to higher expenses associated with long-term employee incentive compensation plans as the prior-year period includes the benefit from the reversal of such accruals that did not recur in the current-year period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These items were partially offset by the following:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of 160 basis points primarily due to the impact of Constant $ revenue growth with respect to our fixed expenses.

See Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on Egypt.\nSee Segment Review\u201d in this MD&A for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment.\nOther Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $12 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the increase in the interest rates on the 2013 Notes (defined below) as a result of the long-term credit rating downgrades.\nInterest income decreased by approximately $2 compared to the prior-year period.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 was comprised of approximately $5 for the make-whole premium and approximately $1 for the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts associated with the prepayment of our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). Refer to Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in this MD&A for additional information.\nOther expense, net, decreased by approximately $66 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to a less significant impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, as we recorded a benefit of approximately $4 in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to a loss of approximately $54 in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, the decrease in other expense, net was partially due to lower foreign exchange losses, which decreased by approximately $10 compared to the prior-year period. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nGain on sale of business in 2015 was the result of the sale of Liz Earle in July 2015. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the sale of Liz Earle.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate in 2015 was negatively impacted by additional valuation allowances for U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $670. The additional valuation allowances in 2015 were due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and the impact on the benefits from our tax planning strategies associated with the realization of our deferred tax assets. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2015 was negatively impacted by additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets outside of the U.S. of approximately $15, primarily in Russia, which was largely due to lower earnings, which were significantly impacted by foreign exchange losses on working capital balances. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a benefit of approximately $19 as a result of the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies. The additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in 2015 caused income taxes to be significantly in excess of income before taxes.\nThe effective tax rate in 2014 was negatively impacted by a non-cash income tax charge of approximately $396. This was largely due to a valuation allowance, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, against deferred tax assets of approximately $375 which is primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets. The approximate $375 includes the valuation allowance recorded for U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $367, as well as approximately $8 associated with other foreign subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were negatively impacted by the devaluations of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting discussed further within \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A.\nSee Note 7, Income Taxes on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for more information.\nThe Adjusted effective tax rate in 2015 was negatively impacted by the country mix of earnings and the inability to recognize additional deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions related to our current-year operating results. The Adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 was negatively impacted by an adjustment to the carrying value of our state deferred tax balances due to changes in the expected tax rate, valuation allowances for deferred taxes, including the impact of legislative changes, and out-of-period adjustments of approximately $6 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $349 compared to a loss of $40 for 2014. During 2015, we recorded a charge of approximately $340 before tax ($340 after tax) associated with the estimated loss on the sale of the North America business that is expected to be completed in 2016. In addition, the North America operations achieved higher operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014 despite lower revenues as a result of significant cost savings, as well as lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives.\nThe estimated loss on sale was comprised of the following:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash to be contributed to the North America business at closing\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on net liability reduction\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acceleration of pension and postretirement items in AOCI\n</td> <td>(278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension and postretirement related items\n</td> <td>(142\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets to be contributed at closing (excluding pension items above)\n</td> <td>(206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to sell\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Implied value of ownership interest in North America business\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated loss on sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(340\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion of the pension settlement charges.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nDuring 2015, foreign currency had a significant impact on our financial results. Specifically, as compared to the prior-year period, foreign currency has impacted our consolidated financial results as a result of:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>foreign currency transaction losses (classified within cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses), which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of an estimated $210, or approximately 280 points to Adjusted operating margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>foreign currency translation, which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of approximately $265 (of which approximately $90 related to Venezuela), or approximately 200 points to Adjusted operating margin; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower foreign exchange losses (classified within other expense, net), which had a favorable impact of approximately $10 before tax.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2014 Compared to 2013\nRevenue\nTotal revenue in 2014 declined 10% compared to the prior-year period, due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue increased 3%, and benefited by approximately 1 point due to the net impact of certain tax benefits in Brazil. In 2014 and 2013, we recognized tax credits in Brazil of approximately $85 and approximately $29, respectively, primarily associated with a change in estimate of expected recoveries of VAT. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of the tax benefits in Brazil. Constant $ revenue benefited from higher average order, which was partially offset by a 4% decrease in Active Representatives. The net impact of price and mix increased 5%, as pricing benefited from inflationary impacts in Latin America, primarily in Argentina and Venezuela, while units sold decreased 2%. During 2014, our Constant $ revenue benefited from net growth in Latin America and Europe, Middle East & Africa, which was partially offset by a net decline in Asia Pacific. Constant $ revenue growth in Latin America was primarily driven by Venezuela largely due to inflationary pricing, which was partially offset by declines in Mexico. Constant $ revenue growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa was driven by South Africa and the United Kingdom, which was partially offset by revenue declines in Russia and Turkey. Constant $ revenue in Russia was negatively impacted by a difficult economy, including the impact of geopolitical uncertainties, and its decline in the first half of 2014 was partially offset by Constant $ revenue growth in the second half of 2014 driven by actions to improve unit sales. In Asia Pacific, Constant $ revenue declined as compared to 2013 as growth in the Philippines was more than offset by declines in the other Asia Pacific markets. See \"Segment Review\" in this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment.\nOn a category basis, our net sales and associated growth rates were as follows: Table 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/Point Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beauty:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Skincare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,281.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,556.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fragrance\n</td> <td>1,966.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,202.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Color\n</td> <td>1,365.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,548.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Beauty\n</td> <td>5,612.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fashion & Home:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fashion\n</td> <td>1,040.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,169.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home\n</td> <td>819.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>902.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fashion & Home\n</td> <td>1,860.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,072.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,472.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,379.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin and Adjusted operating margin decreased 70 basis points and increased 20 basis points, respectively, compared to 2013. The increase in Adjusted operating margin includes the benefits associated with the $400M Cost Savings Initiative, primarily reductions in headcount, as well as other cost reductions. The decrease in operating margin and increase in Adjusted operating margin are discussed further below in \"Gross Margin,\" \"Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\" and \"Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nGross Margin\nGross margin and Adjusted gross margin decreased 200 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively, compared to 2013. The gross margin comparison was largely impacted by an adjustment of approximately $116 associated with our Venezuela operations to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Partially offsetting the decrease in gross margin was a lower negative impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting, as approximately $5 was recognized in the current-year period as compared to approximately $45 in the prior-year period associated with carrying certain non-monetary assets at the historical U.S. dollar cost following a devaluation. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nThe decrease of 90 basis points in Adjusted gross margin was primarily due to the following:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of approximately 140 basis points due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction losses and foreign currency translation, driven by Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of 80 basis points due to the favorable net impact of mix and pricing, primarily in Latin America, which includes the realization of price increases in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2014 decreased approximately $535 compared to 2013. This decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many of our foreign currencies resulted in lower reported selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is also due to the $89 accrual for the settlements relating to the FCPA investigations recorded in 2013, lower expenses related to our Service Model Transformation (\"SMT\") project as a result of our decision to halt the further roll-out beyond the pilot market of Canada in the fourth quarter of 2013, lower professional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigation and compliance reviews and lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was the additional $46 accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and a higher amount of CTI restructuring primarily associated with the $400M Cost Savings Initiative.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 80 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, compared to 2013. The selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue comparison was impacted by a higher amount of CTI restructuring as compared to the prior-year period. Additionally, in the current-year period, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was impacted by the additional $46 accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA\ninvestigations, approximately $16 associated with our Venezuela operations for certain non-monetary assets carried at the historical U.S. dollar cost following a devaluation, and the approximate $10 aggregate settlement charges recorded in 2014 associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In the prior-year period, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was impacted by the $89 accrual for the settlements relating to the FCPA investigations and $5 associated with our Venezuela operations for certain non-monetary assets carried at the historical U.S. dollar cost following a devaluation.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on CTI restructuring, Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on SMT, Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on the FCPA investigations, \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expenses\" in this MD&A and Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion of the pension settlement charges and \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nThe decrease of 120 basis points in Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the following:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of 80 basis points from lower expenses related to our SMT project as a result of our decision to halt the further roll-out beyond the pilot market of Canada in the fourth quarter of 2013;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of 50 basis points primarily due to the impact of Constant $ revenue growth with respect to our fixed expenses.

See Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on China.\nSee Segment Review\u201d in this MD&A for additional information related to changes in operating margin by segment.\nOther Expense\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $9 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances partially offset by higher average interest rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt in 2013 is comprised of approximately $71 for the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the prepayment of our private notes issued in 2010 and approximately $2 for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the early repayment of the $380 of outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement, which occurred in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, in the second quarter of 2013, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $13 for the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs, partially offset by a deferred gain associated with the January 2013 interest-rate swap agreement termination, associated with the prepayment of notes due in 2014. See Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in this MD&A for more information.\nInterest income decreased by approximately $11 compared to the prior-year period, primarily impacted by $12 for interest income that benefited the fourth quarter of 2013, due to an out-of-period adjustment related to judicial deposits in Brazil.\nOther expense, net, increased by approximately $56 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses. Foreign exchange losses increased by approximately $41 compared to the prior-year period, with the most significant impact due to the weakening of the Russian ruble. In addition, the increase in other expense, net was also due to a more significant impact, approximately $54 in 2014 as compared to approximately $34 in 2013, from the devaluations of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A for a further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate in 2014 was negatively impacted by a non-cash income tax charge of approximately $396. This was largely due to a valuation allowance, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, for deferred tax assets of approximately $375 which is primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets. The approximate $375 includes the valuation allowance recorded for U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $367, as well as approximately $8 associated with other foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013 were impacted by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting discussed further within \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A. The effective tax rate in 2013 was also negatively impacted by the $89 accrual for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations, the non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets associated with our China business of approximately $42, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to China of approximately $9, and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela in the fourth quarter of approximately $42. See Note 7, Income Taxes on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for more information.\nThe Adjusted effective tax rate for 2014 negatively impacted by an adjustment to the carrying value of our state deferred tax balances due to changes in the expected tax rate, valuation allowances for deferred taxes, including the impact of legislative changes, and an out-of-period adjustment of approximately $6 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $40 compared to a loss of $119 for 2013. During 2013, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $117 ($74 after tax) for capitalized software related to SMT and a charge of approximately $79 ($50 after tax) associated with our Silpada jewelry business which was sold in July 2013. The North America Avon operations achieved lower operating income in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to lower revenues, higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives and settlement charges associated with the U.S. pension plan. These were partially offset by significant cost savings from our North America Avon business as compared to 2013.\nSee Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through and \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expenses\" in this MD&A and Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion of the pension settlement charges.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was approximately ($151) in 2015 compared with approximately ($348) in 2014, primarily due to net actuarial gains of approximately $41 in 2015 as compared with net actuarial losses of approximately $187 in 2014. In 2015, net actuarial gains benefited from higher discount rates for the non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, partially offset by lower asset returns in the non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans in 2015 as compared to 2014. The other comprehensive income (loss) year-over-year comparison was also unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation adjustments, which increased by approximately $27 as compared to 2014 primarily due to unfavorable movements of the Brazilian real, partially offset by the year-over-year comparison of movements of the Polish zloty and Russian ruble.\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes was approximately ($348) in 2014 compared with approximately $5 in 2013, primarily due to net actuarial losses of approximately $187 in 2014 as compared with net actuarial gains of approximately $81 in 2013. In 2014, net actuarial losses were negatively impacted by lower discount rates for the non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans and updated mortality rates for the U.S. pension plan, partially offset by higher asset returns in the non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans in 2014 as compared to 2013. The other comprehensive income (loss) year-over-year comparison was also unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation adjustments, as well as higher amortization of net actuarial loss which was driven by the settlement charges associated with the U.S. pension plan. In 2014, foreign currency translation adjustments were negatively impacted by approximately $136 as compared to 2013 primarily due to unfavorable movements of the Polish zloty, the British pound, the Colombian peso and the Mexican peso.\nSee Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nSegment Review\nBelow is an analysis of the key factors affecting revenue and operating profit (loss) by reportable segment for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nProfit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nProfit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\nProfit (Loss)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,260.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,239.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,840.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe, Middle East & Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,272.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,705.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,898.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>757.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,160.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,648.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,496.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,160.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,648.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,496.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLatin America -

See below for further discussion regarding the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation. On a Constant $ basis, revenue increased 1%, despite the growth rate being negatively impacted by approximately 5 points due to taxes in Brazil from the combined impact of the recognition of VAT credits in 2014 along with a new IPI tax on cosmetics in 2015. Specifically, during 2014, we recognized $85 in Brazil for expected VAT recoveries which did not recur in 2015, and as such, there was an approximate 2 point negative impact on the region's Constant $ growth rate. In addition, an IPI tax law on cosmetics in Brazil went into effect in May 2015 and has caused an estimated 3 point negative impact on the region's Constant $ revenue growth. Further, the markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina) contributed approximately 5 points to the region's Constant $ revenue growth. The region's Constant $ revenue growth benefited from higher average order, which was partially offset by a decrease in Active Representatives. The region's higher average order was positively impacted by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), as these markets benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing, while Active Representatives was negatively impacted by these markets. Average order was negatively impacted by the taxes in Brazil. Revenue in Brazil decreased 34%, unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, or decreased 8% on a Constant $ basis. Revenue in Mexico declined 15%, unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, or increased 2% on a Constant $ basis, primarily due to higher average order.\nBrazil's Constant $ revenue decline of 8% was negatively impacted by approximately 10 points due to the combined impact of the VAT credits in 2014 and the IPI tax in 2015 discussed above. The negative impact of these tax items were partially offset by an increase in Active Representatives. On a Constant $ basis, Brazil's sales from Beauty products decreased 5%, negatively impacted by the IPI tax. This negative impact on Beauty sales was partially offset by increased sales of fragrance, which benefited from our alliance with Coty, as well as from new product launches during the first quarter of 2015. The IPI tax also negatively impacted Brazil's Beauty units, as we increased prices to partially offset the new tax. On a Constant $ basis, Brazil's\nsales from Fashion & Home products increased 1%. Brazil continues to be impacted by a difficult economic environment as well as high levels of competition.\nOperating margin was negatively impacted by .5 points as compared to the prior-year period due to the Venezuelan special items in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting as discussed further below. Operating margin also benefited by .6 points as compared to the prior-year period from lower CTI restructuring. Adjusted operating margin decreased 3.6 points, or 1.8 points on a Constant $ basis, primarily as a result of:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline of 1.9 points associated with the net impact of VAT credits in Brazil recognized in revenue in 2014, discussed above;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline of 1.4 points as a result of the IPI tax law on cosmetics in Brazil, which reduced revenue as we did not raise the prices paid by Representatives to the same extent as the IPI tax;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a net benefit of 1.2 points primarily due to the impact of Constant $ revenue growth with respect to our fixed expenses.

Since 2010, we have been accounting for our operations in Venezuela under accounting guidance associated with highly inflationary economies. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial statements of a foreign entity operating in a highly inflationary economy are required to be remeasured as if the functional currency is the company's reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. This generally results in translation adjustments, caused by changes in the exchange rate, being reported in earnings currently for monetary assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) and liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, accrued expenses) and requires that different procedures be used to translate non-monetary assets (e.g., inventories, fixed assets). Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the historical U.S. dollar cost basis. This diverges significantly from the application of accounting rules prior to designation as highly inflationary accounting, where such gains and losses would have been recognized only in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (shareholders' equity).\nWith respect to our 2013 results, effective February 13, 2013, the official exchange rate moved from 4.30 to 6.30, a devaluation of approximately 32%. As a result of the change in the official rate to 6.30, we recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $51 (approximately $34 in other expense, net, and approximately $17 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits. Additionally, certain non-monetary assets are carried at their historical U.S. dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation. Therefore, these costs will impact the income statement during 2015 at a disproportionate rate as they were not devalued based on the new exchange rates, but were expensed at their historical U.S. dollar value. As a result of using the historical U.S. dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets, such as inventories, these assets continued to be remeasured, following the devaluation, at the applicable rate at the time of their acquisition. As a result, we recognized an additional negative impact of approximately $45 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2013.\nIn March 2013, the Venezuelan government announced a foreign exchange system that increased government control over the allocation of U.S. dollars in the country, referred to as the SICAD I exchange (\"SICAD I\"). In February 2014, the Venezuelan government announced a foreign exchange system which began operating on March 24, 2014, referred to as the SICAD II exchange (\"SICAD II\"). While liquidity was limited through the SICAD II market, in comparison to the other available exchange rates (the official rate and SICAD I rate), it represented the rate which better reflected the economics of Avon Venezuela's business activity. Accordingly, we concluded that we should utilize the SICAD II exchange rate to remeasure our Venezuelan operations effective March 31, 2014.\nWith respect to our 2014 results, at March 31, 2014, the SICAD II exchange rate was approximately 50, as compared to the official exchange rate of 6.30 that we used previously, which caused the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 88%. As a result of our change to the SICAD II rate, we recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $42 (approximately $54 in other expense, net, and a benefit of approximately $12 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of using the historical U.S. dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets, such as inventories, these assets continued to be remeasured, following the change to the SICAD II rate, at the applicable rate at the time of acquisition. As a result, we determined that an adjustment of approximately $116 to cost of sales was needed to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2014. We recognized an\nadditional negative impact of approximately $21 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced that the SICAD II market would no longer be available, and a new foreign exchange system was created, referred to as the SIMADI exchange (\"SIMADI\"). SIMADI began operating on February 12, 2015. The SICAD I and SICAD II markets merged to create a single foreign exchange system, referred to as the SICAD exchange (\"SICAD\"). At December 31, 2015, the SICAD exchange rate was approximately 13. The exchange rates established through the SIMADI market fluctuate and have been significantly higher than both the official rate and SICAD rate. In March 2015, we began to access the SIMADI market and have been able to obtain only limited U.S. dollars. While liquidity is limited through the SIMADI market, in comparison to the other available exchange rates (the official rate and SICAD rate), it represents the rate which better reflects the economics of Avon Venezuela's business activity. Accordingly, we concluded that we should utilize the SIMADI exchange rate to remeasure our Venezuelan operations effective February 12, 2015.\nAt February 12, 2015, the SIMADI exchange rate was approximately 170, as compared to the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50 that we used previously, which caused the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 70%. As a result of our change to the SIMADI rate, we recorded an after-tax benefit of approximately $3 (a benefit of approximately $4 in other expense, net, and a loss of approximately $1 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, certain non-monetary assets are carried at their historical U.S. dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation. Therefore, these costs will impact the income statement during 2015 at a disproportionate rate as they were not devalued based on the new exchange rates, but were expensed at their historical U.S. dollar value. As a result of using the historical U.S. dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets, such as inventories, these assets continued to be remeasured, following the change to the SIMADI rate, at the applicable rate at the time of their acquisition. As a result, we determined that an adjustment of approximately $11 to cost of sales was needed to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We recognized an additional negative impact of approximately $19 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015.\nIn addition, in February 2015, we reviewed Avon Venezuela's long-lived assets to determine whether the carrying amount of the assets was recoverable. Based on our expected cash flows associated with the asset group, we determined that the carrying amount of the assets, carried at their historical U.S. dollar cost basis, was not recoverable. As such, an impairment charge of approximately $90 to selling, general and administrative expenses was recorded to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to estimated fair value of approximately $16, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Further devaluations or regulatory actions may further impair the carrying value of Avon Venezuela's long-lived assets.\nAt December 31, 2015, the SIMADI exchange rate was approximately 200. During 2015, Avon Venezuela (using an average exchange rate which included SICAD II exchange rates in the first part of the first quarter and SIMADI exchange rates in the latter part of the first quarter and the entire second, third and fourth quarters) represented less than 1% of Avon's consolidated revenue and less than 3% of Avon's consolidated Adjusted operating profit. While the rate in the SIMADI market will vary, the ongoing impacts primarily related to the remeasurement of Avon Venezuela's financial statements are not expected to have a material impact on Avon's consolidated results.\nThe Company continuously monitors factors such as our ability to access and transact in the various exchange mechanisms currently in place, the political and economic environment in Venezuela and our ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its Venezuela operations. If the Company is unable to make key operational decisions regarding its business in Venezuela, on an ongoing basis, the Company may conclude that it should deconsolidate its operations in Venezuela. At December 31, 2015, we had a net asset position in Avon Venezuela of approximately $33 and accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (shareholders' equity) associated with foreign currency movements before Venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy of approximately $81.\nArgentina Discussion\nIn 2011, the Argentine government introduced restrictive foreign currency exchange controls. In December 2015, the Argentine government began the process of removing foreign currency exchange controls; however, some uncertainty exists regarding the foreign currency exchange controls in the future. Unless foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Argentina's operations may be negatively impacted. At December 31, 2015, we had a net asset position of approximately $92 associated with our operations in Argentina, including cash of approximately $48. During 2015, Avon Argentina represented approximately 7% of Avon's consolidated revenue and approximately 18% of Avon's consolidated Adjusted operating profit.\nAlso in late December 2015, the exchange rate in Argentina was devalued by approximately 25%, from approximately 10 to approximately 13 at December 31, 2015. Avon Argentina's 2015 results were not materially impacted by this devaluation as it\noccurred late in the year. As of December 31, 2015, we did not account for Argentina as a highly inflationary economy, and as a result, this devaluation did not negatively impact earnings with respect to Argentina's monetary and non-monetary assets.\nLatin America - 2014 Compared to 2013\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/Point Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,239.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,840.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>478.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CTI restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuelan special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>536.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CTI restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuelan special items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Active Representatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in units sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts in the table above may not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nTotal revenue decreased 12% compared to the prior-year period due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, revenue grew 5%. The region's revenue growth benefited by approximately 1 point due to the net impact of certain tax benefits in Brazil. In addition, higher average order was partially offset by a decrease in Active Representatives. Average order benefited from pricing, including inflationary impacts, primarily in Venezuela. Revenue in Venezuela and Mexico declined 55% and 9%, respectively, which were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, and Constant $ revenue in Venezuela and Mexico increased 45% and declined 6%, respectively. Revenue in Brazil declined 5%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, and Constant $ revenue in Brazil increased 3%. Brazil's revenue benefited by approximately 3 points as a result of the net impact of certain tax benefits.\nIn 2014, our Constant $ revenue growth and Constant $ operating profit growth were not impacted by the use of the SICAD II exchange rate as we applied the exchange rate of 6.30 to current and prior periods for our Venezuela operations in order to determine Constant $ growth. If we had used an exchange rate of 50 (which is a rate more reflective of the SICAD II rate) for our Venezuela operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, the region's Constant $ revenue would have been an increase of 1% from the prior-year period, the region's Constant $ Adjusted operating margin would have been a decrease of .8 points from the prior-year period, and Avon's consolidated Constant $ revenue decline would have been a decrease of 2% from the prior-year period. As we update our Constant $ rates on an annual basis, we utilized a rate of approximately 50 in our Constant $ financial performance beginning with our 2015 results. See below for further discussion regarding the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation.\nBrazil's Constant $ revenue benefited by approximately 3 points due to the net benefit of larger tax credits recognized in 2014 as compared to the benefit and tax credits recognized in 2013. In 2014 and 2013, we recognized tax credits in Brazil of approximately $85 and approximately $29, respectively, primarily associated with a change in estimate of expected recoveries of VAT. Of the VAT credits recognized in 2014, approximately $13 were out-of-period adjustments. As the tax credits are associated with VAT, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, the benefit from these VAT credits is recognized as revenue. Brazil's Active Representatives and average order were relatively unchanged from the prior-year period. On a Constant $ basis, Brazil's sales from both Beauty and Fashion & Home products were relatively unchanged.\nMexico's Constant $ revenue decline was primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives, partially offset by higher average order. Constant $ revenue growth in Venezuela was primarily due to higher average order, partially offset by a decrease in Active Representatives. Venezuela's average order benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing that was partially offset by a decrease in units sold. Venezuela's Active Representatives and units sold were negatively impacted by the reduced size of our product offering, primarily the result of our increased difficulty to import products and raw materials. Additional information on our Venezuela operations is discussed in more detail above.\nOperating margin was negatively impacted by 2.2 points as compared to the prior-year period due to the Venezuelan special items in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting as discussed further above. Operating margin was also negatively\nimpacted by .4 points as compared to the prior-year period from higher CTI restructuring. Adjusted operating margin decreased .6 points, or increased .1 points on a Constant $ basis, primarily as a result of:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a benefit of 1.1 points from lower Representative, sales leader and field expense, which was primarily attributable to a shift towards more cost-effective incentives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a benefit of 1.0 point associated with the net impact of the incremental tax credits in Brazil recognized as revenue in 2014 and 2013, discussed above;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a benefit of .3 points from lower net brochure costs, driven by Venezuela as a result of cost savings initiatives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline of .8 points due to lower gross margin caused primarily by 1.4 points from the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction losses, primarily in Venezuela, and .9 points from higher supply chain costs, which was driven by higher obsolescence primarily in Venezuela and Brazil.

On a Constant $ basis, revenue grew 6%, primarily driven by Eastern Europe. The region's Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points as a result of the sale of Liz Earle. An increase in Active Representatives drove the region's Constant $ revenue growth.\nIn Russia, revenue declined 23%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, Russia's revenue grew 23%, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives which benefited from sustained momentum in recruiting and retention, and higher average order. In the United Kingdom, revenue declined 12%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, the United Kingdom's revenue declined 5%, primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives. In Turkey, revenue declined 15%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, Turkey's revenue grew 5%. In South Africa, revenue grew 1%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, South Africa's revenue grew 19%, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives and higher average order.\nOperating margin was negatively impacted by .3 points as compared to the prior-year period due to the impact of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with our Egypt business during 2015. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 was recorded based on our annual impairment analysis. See Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on Egypt.

On a Constant $ basis, revenue grew 1%. The region's Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point as a result of the closure of the France business.\nIn Russia, revenue declined 18%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, Russia's revenue declined 1%, primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives, partially offset by higher average order. Russia was negatively impacted by a difficult economy, including the impact of geopolitical uncertainties. Russia's Constant $ revenue decline in the first half of 2014 was partially offset by Constant $ revenue growth in the second half of 2014, driven by actions to improve unit sales. In the United Kingdom, revenue increased 6%, which was favorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, the United Kingdom's revenue increased 1%, primarily due to higher average order, partially offset by a decrease in Active Representatives. In Turkey, revenue declined 14%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, Turkey's revenue declined 2%, primarily due to lower average order. In South Africa, revenue declined 3%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, South Africa's revenue increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives.\nOperating margin was negatively impacted by .3 points as compared to the prior-year period from higher CTI restructuring. Adjusted operating margin decreased 2.6 points, or 2.4 points on a Constant $ basis, primarily as a result of a decline of 2.2 points due to lower gross margin caused primarily by an estimated 3 points from the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by 1.0 point from lower supply chain costs.\nAsia Pacific - 2015 Compared to 2014\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%/Point Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>627.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>702.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CTI restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CTI restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Active Representatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in units sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Calculation not meaningful\nAmounts in the table above may not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nTotal revenue decreased 11% compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

On a Constant $ basis, revenue decreased 4%, as an increase in the Philippines was more than offset by declines in the other Asia Pacific markets. Constant $ revenue was also impacted by a decrease in Active Representatives, partially offset by higher average order. Revenue in the Philippines declined 2%, which was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a Constant $ basis, revenue in the Philippines increased 3%, as higher average order was partially offset by a decrease in Active Representatives. Revenue in China declined 10% on both a reported and Constant $ basis, primarily due to a decline in the number of beauty boutiques. The decline in the number of beauty boutiques negatively impacted unit sales, but was partially offset by actions taken during the second half of 2013 which were intended to reduce inventory levels held by the beauty boutiques that did not recur in 2014.\nOperating margin benefited by 5.6 points as compared to the prior-year period due to the impact of non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with our China business during 2013. The non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in the third quarter of 2013 was recorded based on an interim impairment analysis, which was completed as a result of the significant lowering of our long-term revenue and earnings projections for China and the decline in revenue performance in China in the third quarter of 2013, which was significantly in excess of our expectations. See Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on China.

See below for a further discussion of the settlement charges.\nAdjusted total global expenses decreased compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher expenses associated with long-term employee incentive compensation plans as the prior-year period includes the benefit from the reversal of such accruals that did not recur in the current-year period. Amounts allocated to segments decreased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower planned corporate expenses, primarily as a result of our cost savings initiatives.\nAs a result of the lump-sum payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a settlement charge of approximately $24. These lump sum payments were made from our plan assets and were not the result of a specific offer to participants of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan as described below. As the settlement threshold was exceeded in the third quarter of 2015, a settlement charge of approximately $4 was also recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of additional payments from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. These settlement charges were allocated between Global Expenses and Discontinued Operations.\nIn an effort to reduce our pension benefit obligations, in March 2014, we offered former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan a payment that would fully settle our pension plan obligation to those participants who elected to receive such payment. The election period ended during the second quarter of 2014 and the payments were made in June 2014 from our plan assets. As a result of the lump-sum payments made, in the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a settlement charge of approximately $24. As the settlement threshold was exceeded in the second quarter of 2014, settlement charges of approximately $5 and approximately $7 were also recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively, as a result of additional payments from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. These settlement charges were allocated between Global Expenses and Discontinued Operations.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe comparability of total global expenses was impacted by the $89 accrual for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations which was recorded in 2013, partially offset by the additional $46 accrual for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and settlement charges associated with the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (discussed above) which were recorded in 2014 and higher CTI restructuring.\nAdjusted total global expenses decreased compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives, including lower expenses related to our SMT project, and to a lesser extent, lower marketing expenses. In addition, professional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigations and compliance reviews decreased compared to the prior-year period.\nProfessional and related fees associated with the FCPA investigations and compliance reviews amounted to approximately $7 in 2014, as compared to approximately $28 in 2013. These fees were not allocated to the segments. Although the FCPA investigations and compliance reviews are now complete and we have reached settlements with the government, we incur costs related to the ongoing compliance with the DPA and Consent.\nWith respect to the global expenses discussion above, for all years presented, please see Risk Factors on pages 10 through 11 of our 2015 Annual Report, and Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information regarding the FCPA settlements, and other related matters, including our expectations with respect to future costs related to the ongoing compliance with the DPA and Consent, including the monitor and self-reporting obligations undertaken pursuant to the settlements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of funding historically have been cash flows from operations, public offerings of notes, bank financings, borrowings under lines of credit, issuance of commercial paper and a private placement of notes. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $687. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months. For more information with respect to foreign currency restrictions, see \"Segment Review - Latin America\" in this MD&A above, and for more information regarding risks with respect to these foreign currency restrictions, see \"Risk Factors - We are subject to financial risks related to our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions\" included in Item 1A on pages 8 through 20 of our 2015 Annual Report.\nWe may seek to repurchase our equity or to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, through derivative instruments or otherwise. Repurchases of equity and debt may be funded by the incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of equity (including shares of preferred stock) or convertible securities and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. We may also elect to incur additional debt or issue equity (including shares of preferred stock) or convertible securities to finance ongoing operations or to meet our other liquidity needs. Any issuances of equity (including shares of preferred stock) or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact earnings per share in future periods. Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2014 and 2015, which may impact our access to these transactions on favorable terms, if at all. For more information see \"Risk Factors - Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2015, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing and increase financing costs. A further downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity.\" \"Risk Factors - Our indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions,\" and \"Risk Factors - A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings\" included in Item 1A on pages 8 through 20 of our 2015 Annual Report.\nOur liquidity could also be negatively impacted by restructuring initiatives, dividends, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and certain contingencies, including any legal or regulatory settlements, described more fully in Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report.

The approximate $198 decrease to net cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings, which were impacted by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Lower operating tax payments (such as VAT), primarily in Brazil, and lower payments for employee incentive compensation in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset these items.\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities during 2014 was approximately $182 lower than during 2013. The approximate $182 decrease to net cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings, which was impacted by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, the $68 fine paid in connection with the FCPA settlement with the DOJ and higher payments for employee incentive compensation. These unfavorable impacts to the year-over-year comparison of cash from operating activities were partially offset by the benefit due to the timing of accounts payable, primarily for inventory purchases. In addition, operating cash flow during 2013 was unfavorably impacted by payments for the make-whole premiums of approximately $90 in connection with the prepayment of debt and an approximate $25 contribution to the United Kingdom pension plan as a result of our decision to freeze the plan, both of which did not recur in 2014.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans (see Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report). Our funding policy for these plans is based on legal requirements and available cash flows. The amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions (as detailed in \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Postretirement Expense\" in this MD&A). The future funding for these plans will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of associates electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. Based on current assumptions, we expect to make contributions in the range of $25 to $30 to our U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and in the range of $20 to $25 to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans during 2016.\nNet Cash from Continuing Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by continuing investing activities during 2015 was approximately $143, as compared to net cash used of $101 during 2014. The approximate $243 increase to net cash provided (used) by continuing investing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds on the sale of Liz Earle of approximately $208, which was partially offset by lower capital expenditures.\nNet cash used by continuing investing activities during 2014 was approximately $101, as compared to $191 during 2013. The approximate $90 decrease to net cash used by continuing investing activities was primarily due to lower capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures during 2015 were approximately $92 compared with approximately $126 during 2014. Capital expenditures during 2014 were approximately $126 compared with approximately $190 during 2013, driven by the decision to halt the further roll-out of SMT beyond Canada in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nCapital expenditures in 2016 are currently expected to be in the range of $115 to $135 and are expected to be funded by cash from operations.\nNet Cash from Continuing Financing Activities\nNet cash used by continuing financing activities was approximately $431 during 2015 compared to approximately $209 during 2014 primarily due to the prepayment of $250 principal amount of our 2.375% Notes (as defined below) in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by the repayment of the remaining $53 outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement in the second quarter of 2014. See Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nNet cash used by continuing financing activities was approximately $209 during 2014 compared to approximately $469 during 2013. This was primarily due to the significant financing transactions in 2013, partially offset by the repayment of the\nremaining approximate $53 outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement in the second quarter of 2014. The 2013 transactions included the prepayment of $535 principal amount of private notes, the prepayment of $500 principal amount of notes due in 2014, the repayment of $498 of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan agreement (as defined below), the scheduled repayment of $250 principal amount of the 4.80% Notes, due March 1, 2013, and the scheduled repayment of $125 principal amount of the 4.625% Notes, due May 15, 2013, which were partially offset by the proceeds of $1.5 billion related to issuance of the 2013 Notes (as defined below) and proceeds of $88 related to the termination of interest-rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. See Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, and Note 8, Financial Instruments and Risk Management on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nWe purchased approximately .3 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 during 2015, as compared to .7 million shares of our common stock for $9.8 during 2014 and .5 million shares for $9.4 during 2013, through repurchases by the Company in connection with employee elections to use shares to pay withholding taxes upon the vesting of their restricted stock units, and in 2014 and 2013, also through private transactions with a broker in connection with stock based obligations under our Deferred Compensation Plan.\nWe maintained a quarterly dividend of $.06 per share for 2015, which was equivalent to our quarterly dividends in both 2014 and 2013. We suspended the dividend effective in the first quarter of 2016.\nDebt and Contractual Financial Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2015, our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and Beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>751.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,163.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt-related interest(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt-related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>621.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>441.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>838.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,791.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>550.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,063.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,830.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts are based on our current long-term credit ratings.

Additionally, as disclosed in Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, at December 31, 2015, we have liabilities of $21.4 associated with our Transformation Plan, $4.0 associated with various restructuring initiatives during 2015 and $6.2 associated with our $400M Cost Savings Initiative. The majority of future cash payments associated with these restructuring liabilities are expected to be made during 2016.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nCapital Resources\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn June 2015, the Company and Avon International Operations, Inc., a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of the Company ( AIO\u201d), entered into a new five-year $400.0 senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2015 revolving credit facility\u201d). The Company terminated its previous $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 revolving credit facility\u201d) in June 2015 prior to its scheduled expiration in March 2017. There were no amounts drawn under the 2013 revolving credit facility on the date of termination and no early termination penalties were incurred. In the second quarter of 2015, $2.5 was recorded for the write-off of issuance costs related to the 2013 revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the 2015 revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 250 basis points or a floating base rate plus 150 basis points, in each case subject to adjustment based upon a leverage-based pricing grid. The 2015 revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2015 revolving credit facility.\nAll obligations of AIO under the 2015 revolving credit facility are (i) unconditionally guaranteed by each material domestic restricted subsidiary of the Company (other than AIO, the borrower), in each case, subject to certain exceptions and (ii) guaranteed on a limited recourse basis by the Company. The obligations of AIO and the guarantors are secured by first priority liens on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of AIO and the subsidiary guarantors and by certain assets of the Company, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe 2015 revolving credit facility will terminate in June 2020; provided, however, that it shall terminate on the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 2018 Notes (as defined below), the 4.20% Notes (as defined below), the 2019 Notes (as defined below) and the 4.60% Notes (as defined below), if on such 91st day, the applicable notes are not redeemed, repaid, discharged, defeased or otherwise refinanced in full.\nThe 2015 revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, which are customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the ability of the Company, AIO or any restricted subsidiary to, subject to certain exceptions, incur liens, incur debt, make restricted payments, make investments or merge, consolidate or dispose of all or substantially all its assets. In addition, the 2015 revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and cross-default provisions, as well as financial covenants (interest coverage and total leverage ratios). As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our interest coverage and total leverage ratios under the 2015 revolving credit facility, and based on then applicable interest rates, the entire $400.0 2015 revolving credit facility could have been drawn down without violating any covenant.\nPublic Notes\nIn March 2013, we issued, in a public offering, $250.0 principal amount of 2.375% Notes due March 15, 2016 (the \"2.375% Notes\"), $500.0 principal amount of 4.60% Notes due March 15, 2020 (the \"4.60% Notes\"), $500.0 principal amount of 5.00% Notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"5.00% Notes\") and $250.0 principal amount of 6.95% Notes due March 15, 2043 (the \"6.95% Notes\") (collectively, the \"2013 Notes\"). The net proceeds from these 2013 Notes were used to repay outstanding debt. Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. On August 10, 2015, we prepaid our 2.375% Notes at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount of $250.0, plus accrued interest of $3.1 and a make-whole premium of $5.0. In connection with the prepayment of our 2.375% Notes, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.5 in the third quarter of 2015 consisting of the $5.0 make-whole premium for the 2.375% Notes and the write-off of $.5 of debt issuance costs and discounts related to the initial issuance of the 2.375% Notes.\nThe indenture governing the 2013 Notes contains interest rate adjustment provisions depending on the long-term credit ratings assigned to the 2013 Notes with S&P and Moody's. As described in the indenture, the interest rates on the 2013 Notes increase by .25% for each one-notch downgrade below investment grade on each of our long-term credit ratings assigned to the 2013 Notes by S&P or Moody's. These adjustments are limited to a total increase of 2% above the respective interest rates in effect on the date of issuance of the 2013 Notes. As a result of the long-term credit rating downgrades by S&P in November 2014 to BB+, in February 2015 to BB and in June 2015 to B+, and by Moody's in October 2014 to Ba1 and in May 2015 to Ba3 for senior unsecured debt, the interest rates on the 2013 Notes have increased by 1.75%, of which .75% was effective as of March 15, 2015 and 1.0% was effective as of September 15, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we also had outstanding $250.0 principal amount of our 5.75% Notes due March 1, 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\"), $250.0 principal amount of our 4.20% Notes due July 15, 2018 (the \"4.20% Notes\") and $350.0 principal amount of our 6.50% Notes due March 1, 2019 (the \"2019 Notes\"), with interest on each series of these Notes payable semi-annually.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes described above contain certain covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and restrictions on the incurrence of sale/leaseback transactions and transactions involving a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, these indentures contain customary events of default and cross-default provisions. Further, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase all of our outstanding notes described above, with the exception of our 4.20% Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change in control involving Avon and a corresponding credit ratings downgrade to below investment grade.\nLong-Term Credit Ratings\nOur long-term credit ratings are Ba2 (Negative Outlook) for corporate family debt, and Ba3 (Negative Outlook) for senior unsecured debt, with Moody's; B+ (Stable Outlook) with S&P; and B+ (Negative Outlook) with Fitch, which are below investment grade. We do not believe these long-term credit ratings will have a material impact on our near-term liquidity. However, any rating agency reviews could result in a change in outlook or downgrade, which could further limit our access to new financing, particularly short-term financing, reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs, affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt securities, and likely result in an increase in financing costs, including interest expense under certain of our debt instruments, and less favorable covenants and financial terms under our financing arrangements. For more information, see \"Risk Factors - A general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings,\" \"Risk Factors - Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2015, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing and increase financing costs. A further downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity,\" and \"Risk Factors - Our indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions\" included in Item 1A on pages 8 through 20 of our 2015 Annual Report.\nPlease also see Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information relating to our debt and the maturities thereof.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed overview of Avon Products, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations for 2015.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share and share data)\nYou should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained in our 2015 Annual Report. When used in this discussion, the terms \"Avon,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on pages 29 through 31 of this MD&A for a description of how Constant dollar (\"Constant $\") growth rates (a Non-GAAP financial measure) are determined.\nOverview\nWe are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. During 2015, we had sales operations in 57 countries and territories, and distributed products in 15 more. In addition, in our North America business (which has been presented as discontinued operations) we had sales operations in 3 countries and territories, and distributed our products in 27 other countries and territories. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations and include commercial business units in Latin America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific. In addition, we operate our business in North America, which has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and is discussed further below. Our product categories are Beauty and Fashion & Home. Beauty consists of skincare (which includes personal care), fragrance and color (cosmetics). Fashion & Home consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children's products and nutritional products. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had nearly 6 million active Representatives which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. During 2015, all of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside of the U.S.\nIn December 2015, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management (\"Cerberus\"), which include a $435 investment in Avon by an affiliate of Cerberus through the purchase of our convertible preferred stock and the separation of the North America business from Avon into a privately-held company, which will include a $100 contribution by Avon, that will be majority-owned and managed by an affiliate of Cerberus. Avon will retain approximately 20% ownership in this new privately-held company. These transactions are expected to close concurrently in the first half of 2016. The North America business, which represents the Company's operations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, was previously its own reportable segment and has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the investment by an affiliate of Cerberus and the separation of the North America business.\nTotal revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 declined 19% compared to the prior-year period, due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue increased 2%. Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points due to taxes in Brazil from the combined impact of the recognition of Value Added Tax (\"VAT\") credits in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 along with a new Industrial Productions Tax (\"IPI\") on cosmetics which went into effect in May 2015. Constant $ revenue was also negatively impacted by approximately 1 point as a result of the sale of Liz Earle which was completed in July 2015. Sales from the Beauty category decreased 20%, or increased 3% on a Constant $ basis. Sales from the Fashion & Home category decreased 15%, or increased 5% on a Constant $ basis.\nOur Constant $ revenue benefited from growth in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), which contributed approximately 2 points to our Constant $ revenue growth. Our Constant $ revenue also benefited from growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine), and to a lesser extent, South Africa and underlying growth in Brazil. Constant $ revenue benefited from higher average order and a 1% increase in Active Representatives. The increase in Active Representatives was primarily due to growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Russia, which was primarily due to sustained momentum in recruitment and retention, partially offset by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina). The net impact of price and mix increased 4%, driven by increases in all regions. The net impact of price and mix was primarily positively impacted by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), as these markets benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing. Units sold decreased 2%, primarily due to declines in units sold in Brazil and Venezuela, partially offset by an increase in units sold in Russia. See \"Segment Review\" of this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment.\nOver the last two years, our profitability has suffered significantly given our geographic footprint and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of key Avon markets. As a result, our revenue and profits have been reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins have been negatively impacted by country mix, as certain of our markets which have historically had higher operating margins experienced significant devaluation of their local currency. In addition, as our sales and costs are often denominated in different currencies, this has created a negative foreign currency transaction impact. Specifically, as compared to the prior-year period, foreign currency has impacted our consolidated financial results as a result of foreign currency transaction losses (classified within cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses), which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of an estimated $210, foreign currency translation, which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of approximately $265 (of which approximately $90 related to Venezuela, as discussed further below), and lower foreign exchange losses on our working capital (classified within other expense, net), which had a favorable impact of approximately $10 before tax.\nIn November 2015, we announced an internal reorganization of our management structure, including the combined management of Latin America and Europe, Middle East & Africa, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the internal reorganization, we will report results for the following four reportable segments beginning in the first quarter of 2016: Europe, Middle East & Africa; Northern Latin America; South America; and Asia Pacific.\nIn January 2016, we announced a transformation plan (the \"Transformation Plan\"), which includes investing in growth, reducing costs in an effort to continue to improve our cost structure and improving our financial resilience. As a result of this plan, we expect to invest $350 into the business over the next three years with an estimated $150 in media and social selling and $200 related to the service model evolution and information technology, which will be aimed at improving the overall Representative experience. With respect to cost reductions, we have targeted pre-tax annualized cost savings of approximately $350 after three years, with an estimated $200 from supply chain reductions and an estimated $150 from other cost reductions. These cost savings are expected to be achieved through restructuring actions as well as other cost-savings strategies that will not result in restructuring charges. We are targeting the realization of $70 of these pre-tax cost savings in 2016. We have initiated this Transformation Plan in order to enable us to achieve our long-term goals of double-digit operating margin and mid single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth. While we expect to evaluate options to improve our financial resilience, we have already implemented actions in this area, including refinancing our revolving credit facility, divesting Liz Earle Beauty Co. Limited (\"Liz Earle\"), prepaying our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Capital Resources\" on pages 58 through 59) and suspending our dividend.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report and Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our Annual Report for more information on these items.\nIn July 2015, we sold Liz Earle, and as a result, we expect Avon's Constant $ and reported revenue in 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately 1 point. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced that the SICAD II market would no longer be available, and a new foreign exchange system was created, referred to as the SIMADI exchange (\"SIMADI\"). SIMADI began operating on February 12, 2015. Use of the SIMADI exchange rate caused the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 70%. In addition, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $11 to cost of sales and approximately $90 to selling, general and administrative expenses in order to reflect the write-down of inventory and long-lived assets, respectively, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We recognized an additional negative impact of approximately $19 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 due to the recognition of the cost basis at a higher exchange rate than the rate at which revenue was reported in U.S. dollars. In addition to the negative impact to operating margin, we recorded an after-tax benefit of approximately $3 (a benefit of approximately $4 in other expense, net, and a loss of approximately $1 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" of this MD&A for further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nInformation relating to new accounting standards is included in Note 2, New Accounting Standards, to our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2015 Annual Report.\nPerformance Metrics\nWithin this MD&A, in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue, operating profit and operating margin, we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business.\n Performance Metrics Definition Change in Active Representatives This metric is a measure of Representative activity based on the number of unique Representatives submitting at least one order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. To determine the change in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Orders in China are excluded from this metric as our business in China is predominantly retail. Liz Earle was also excluded from this calculation as it did not distribute through the direct-selling channel. Change in units sold This metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and products contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or discount purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Change in Average Order This metric is a measure of Representative productivity. The calculation is the difference of the year-over-year change in revenue on a Constant $ basis and the Change in Active Representatives. Change in Average Order may be impacted by a combination of factors such as inflation, units, product mix, and/or pricing. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, including changes in: revenue, operating profit, Adjusted operating profit, operating margin and Adjusted operating margin. We also refer to these adjusted financial measures as Constant $ items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current-year results and prior-year results at a constant exchange rate. Foreign currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant-currency growth rates.\nWe also present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, total and net global expenses, operating profit, operating margin and effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a Non-GAAP basis. We refer to these Non-GAAP financial measures as \"Adjusted.\" We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the Non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement (\"CTI\") restructuring initiatives, 2) costs and charges related to the devaluations of Venezuelan currency in February 2015, March 2014 and February 2013, combined with being designated as a highly inflationary economy, and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela (\"Venezuelan special items\"), 3) the $89 accrual recorded in 2013 for the settlements related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") investigations, the additional $46 accrual in 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the associated approximate $19 net tax benefit (\"FCPA accrual\"), 4) the settlement charges associated with the U.S. pension plan (\"Pension settlement charge\"), 5) the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business, and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business (\"Asset impairment and other charges\"), 6) various other items associated with the sale of Liz Earle, the separation of the North America business and debt-related charges (\"Other items\") and, as it relates to our effective tax rate discussion, 7) the non-cash income tax adjustments associated with our deferred tax assets recorded in 2015 and 2014, and an income tax benefit realized as a result of tax planning strategies (\"Special tax items\"). The Company believes investors find the Non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. These Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 caused by the devaluations of Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and non-monetary assets, such as inventories. For non-monetary assets, the Venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical U.S. dollar cost of the assets at the previous\nexchange rate and the revised exchange rate. In 2015 and 2014, the Venezuelan special items also include adjustments of approximately $11 and approximately $116, respectively, to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value. In 2015, the Venezuelan special items also include an impairment charge of approximately $90 to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value. In 2013, the devaluation was as a result of the change in the official exchange rate, which moved from 4.30 to 6.30. In 2014, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the official exchange rate of 6.30 to the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50. In 2015, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50 to the SIMADI exchange rate of approximately 170. The Venezuelan special items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nThe Pension settlement charge includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014 associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Such payments fully settle our pension plan obligation to those participants who elected to receive such payment.\nThe Asset impairment and other charges include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Asset impairment and other charges also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business in 2013.\nThe Other items include the impact during 2015 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to the gain on the sale of Liz Earle. The Other items also includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 caused by transaction-related costs of $3.1 associated with the planned separation of the North America business that were included in continuing operations. In addition, Other items includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the loss on extinguishment of debt caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts associated with the prepayment of our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Other items also include the impact on other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $2.5 associated with the write-off of issuance costs related to our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility. The Other items, in 2013, also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the prepayment of our private notes issued in 2010, as well as the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the early repayment of $380 of the outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement. The Other items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2013 caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, partially offset by a deferred gain associated with the January 2013 interest-rate swap agreement termination, associated with the prepayment of the notes due in 2014.\nIn addition, the effective tax rate discussion includes Special tax items which include the impact during 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge in the first quarter of 2015 and a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2015, each associated with valuation allowances, to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that was \"more likely than not\" to be realized. These adjustments were primarily caused by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets. The Special tax items also include the impact during the third quarter of 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge as a result of establishing a valuation allowance for the full amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets due to the impact of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and its associated effect on our tax planning strategies. Additionally, the Special tax items includes the impact on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge associated with valuation allowances, to adjust certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. The non-U.S. valuation allowance included an adjustment associated with Russia, which was primarily the result of lower earnings, which were significantly impacted by foreign exchange losses on working capital balances. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2014 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge primarily associated with a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized, and was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and, to a lesser extent, the finalization of the FCPA settlements. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2015 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to an income tax benefit recognized as a result of the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Results Of Operations - Consolidated\" below, \"Segment Review - Latin America\" below, Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expense\" below, Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015\nAnnual Report, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below, Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, and Note 7, Income Taxes on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on these items.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nRepresentatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a three- to four-week duration. The Representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to us during each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances, including seasonality and changing trends. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense was $144 in 2015, $171 in 2014 and $209 in 2013, or approximately 2% of total revenue in each year. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collection of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nAllowances for Sales Returns\nPolicies and practices for product returns vary by jurisdiction, but within many jurisdictions, we generally allow an unlimited right of return. We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, annual sales returns were $191 for 2015, $241 for 2014 and $274 for 2013, or approximately 3% of total revenue in each year, which has been generally in line with our expectations. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required.\nProvisions for Inventory Obsolescence\nWe record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $45 in 2015, $78 in 2014 and $82 in 2013.\nPension and Postretirement Expense\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and a portion of employees in international locations. However, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is closed to employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care benefits subject to certain limitations to many retired employees in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on our benefit plans.\nPension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are generally reviewed and determined on an annual basis. These assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations, the rate of compensation increase of plan participants and mortality rates. We use a December 31 measurement date for all of our employee benefit plans.\nFor 2015, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 6.87%, as compared with 6.86% for 2014. In determining the long-term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans' investments, an expectation for the plans' investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary.\nAs part of the separation of the North America business, we will transfer certain pension liabilities under the U.S. defined benefit pension plan associated with current and former employees of the North America business and certain other former Avon employees, along with a portion of the assets held by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, to a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the new privately-held company. We will also transfer certain other postretirement liabilities (namely, retiree medical and supplemental pension liabilities) in respect of such employees and former employees. We will continue to retain certain U.S. pension and other postretirement liabilities primarily associated with employees who are actively employed by Avon outside of the North America business. Prior to this separation, our net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were allocated between Discontinued Operations and Global and Other Expenses as the plan includes both North America and U.S. Corporate Avon associates. In line with this allocation, our ongoing net periodic benefit costs within Global and Other Expenses are not expected to be materially impacted by the separation of the North America business.\nBeginning in 2014, we adopted an investment strategy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan which is designed to match the movements in the pension liability through an increased allocation towards debt securities. In addition, we also have begun to utilize derivative instruments to achieve the desired market exposures or to hedge certain risks. Derivative instruments may include, but are not limited to, futures, options, swaps or swaptions. Investment types, including the use of derivatives are based on written guidelines established for each investment manager and monitored by the plan's investment committee. In 2015, similar investment strategies were implemented in some of our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nA significant portion of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2015 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan was 7.25%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 70% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 3% to 5% in the long-term) and approximately 30% in equity securities and high yield securities (which are expected to earn approximately 5% to 7% in the long term). In addition to the physical assets, the asset portfolio has derivative instruments which increase our exposure to higher yielding securities. Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan were approximately 8% for the most recent 10-year period and approximately 8% for the 20-year period. In the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, our asset allocation policy has historically favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned approximately 7% over the 10-year period and approximately 8% over the 20-year period. The rate of return on the plan assets in the U.S. was approximately negative 3% in 2015 and approximately 11% in 2014.\nThe discount rate used for determining the present value of future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of bonds that receive a high-quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high-quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted-average discount rate for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans determined on this basis was 3.92% at December 31, 2015, and 3.54% at", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share and share data)\nYou should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained in our 2015 Annual Report. When used in this discussion, the terms \"Avon,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on pages 29 through 31 of this MD&A for a description of how Constant dollar (\"Constant $\") growth rates (a Non-GAAP financial measure) are determined.\nOverview\nWe are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. During 2015, we had sales operations in 57 countries and territories, and distributed products in 15 more. In addition, in our North America business (which has been presented as discontinued operations) we had sales operations in 3 countries and territories, and distributed our products in 27 other countries and territories. Our reportable segments are based on geographic operations and include commercial business units in Latin America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific. In addition, we operate our business in North America, which has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and is discussed further below. Our product categories are Beauty and Fashion & Home. Beauty consists of skincare (which includes personal care), fragrance and color (cosmetics). Fashion & Home consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children's products and nutritional products. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had nearly 6 million active Representatives which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. The success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives. During 2015, all of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside of the U.S.\nIn December 2015, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management (\"Cerberus\"), which include a $435 investment in Avon by an affiliate of Cerberus through the purchase of our convertible preferred stock and the separation of the North America business from Avon into a privately-held company, which will include a $100 contribution by Avon, that will be majority-owned and managed by an affiliate of Cerberus. Avon will retain approximately 20% ownership in this new privately-held company. These transactions are expected to close concurrently in the first half of 2016. The North America business, which represents the Company's operations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, was previously its own reportable segment and has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the investment by an affiliate of Cerberus and the separation of the North America business.\nTotal revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 declined 19% compared to the prior-year period, due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Constant $ revenue increased 2%. Constant $ revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points due to taxes in Brazil from the combined impact of the recognition of Value Added Tax (\"VAT\") credits in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 along with a new Industrial Productions Tax (\"IPI\") on cosmetics which went into effect in May 2015. Constant $ revenue was also negatively impacted by approximately 1 point as a result of the sale of Liz Earle which was completed in July 2015. Sales from the Beauty category decreased 20%, or increased 3% on a Constant $ basis. Sales from the Fashion & Home category decreased 15%, or increased 5% on a Constant $ basis.\nOur Constant $ revenue benefited from growth in markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), which contributed approximately 2 points to our Constant $ revenue growth. Our Constant $ revenue also benefited from growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine), and to a lesser extent, South Africa and underlying growth in Brazil. Constant $ revenue benefited from higher average order and a 1% increase in Active Representatives. The increase in Active Representatives was primarily due to growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa, most significantly Russia, which was primarily due to sustained momentum in recruitment and retention, partially offset by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina). The net impact of price and mix increased 4%, driven by increases in all regions. The net impact of price and mix was primarily positively impacted by markets experiencing relatively high inflation (Venezuela and Argentina), as these markets benefited from the inflationary impact on pricing. Units sold decreased 2%, primarily due to declines in units sold in Brazil and Venezuela, partially offset by an increase in units sold in Russia. See \"Segment Review\" of this MD&A for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment.\nOver the last two years, our profitability has suffered significantly given our geographic footprint and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of key Avon markets. As a result, our revenue and profits have been reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins have been negatively impacted by country mix, as certain of our markets which have historically had higher operating margins experienced significant devaluation of their local currency. In addition, as our sales and costs are often denominated in different currencies, this has created a negative foreign currency transaction impact. Specifically, as compared to the prior-year period, foreign currency has impacted our consolidated financial results as a result of foreign currency transaction losses (classified within cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses), which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of an estimated $210, foreign currency translation, which had an unfavorable impact to Adjusted operating profit of approximately $265 (of which approximately $90 related to Venezuela, as discussed further below), and lower foreign exchange losses on our working capital (classified within other expense, net), which had a favorable impact of approximately $10 before tax.\nIn November 2015, we announced an internal reorganization of our management structure, including the combined management of Latin America and Europe, Middle East & Africa, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the internal reorganization, we will report results for the following four reportable segments beginning in the first quarter of 2016: Europe, Middle East & Africa; Northern Latin America; South America; and Asia Pacific.\nIn January 2016, we announced a transformation plan (the \"Transformation Plan\"), which includes investing in growth, reducing costs in an effort to continue to improve our cost structure and improving our financial resilience. As a result of this plan, we expect to invest $350 into the business over the next three years with an estimated $150 in media and social selling and $200 related to the service model evolution and information technology, which will be aimed at improving the overall Representative experience. With respect to cost reductions, we have targeted pre-tax annualized cost savings of approximately $350 after three years, with an estimated $200 from supply chain reductions and an estimated $150 from other cost reductions. These cost savings are expected to be achieved through restructuring actions as well as other cost-savings strategies that will not result in restructuring charges. We are targeting the realization of $70 of these pre-tax cost savings in 2016. We have initiated this Transformation Plan in order to enable us to achieve our long-term goals of double-digit operating margin and mid single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth. While we expect to evaluate options to improve our financial resilience, we have already implemented actions in this area, including refinancing our revolving credit facility, divesting Liz Earle Beauty Co. Limited (\"Liz Earle\"), prepaying our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Capital Resources\" on pages 58 through 59) and suspending our dividend.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report and Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our Annual Report for more information on these items.\nIn July 2015, we sold Liz Earle, and as a result, we expect Avon's Constant $ and reported revenue in 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately 1 point. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information.\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced that the SICAD II market would no longer be available, and a new foreign exchange system was created, referred to as the SIMADI exchange (\"SIMADI\"). SIMADI began operating on February 12, 2015. Use of the SIMADI exchange rate caused the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 70%. In addition, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $11 to cost of sales and approximately $90 to selling, general and administrative expenses in order to reflect the write-down of inventory and long-lived assets, respectively, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We recognized an additional negative impact of approximately $19 to operating profit and net income relating to these non-monetary assets in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 due to the recognition of the cost basis at a higher exchange rate than the rate at which revenue was reported in U.S. dollars. In addition to the negative impact to operating margin, we recorded an after-tax benefit of approximately $3 (a benefit of approximately $4 in other expense, net, and a loss of approximately $1 in income taxes) in the first quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and liabilities. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" of this MD&A for further discussion of our Venezuela operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nInformation relating to new accounting standards is included in Note 2, New Accounting Standards, to our consolidated financial statements contained in this 2015 Annual Report.\nPerformance Metrics\nWithin this MD&A, in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue, operating profit and operating margin, we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business.\n Performance Metrics Definition Change in Active Representatives This metric is a measure of Representative activity based on the number of unique Representatives submitting at least one order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns in the related period. To determine the change in Active Representatives, this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year. Orders in China are excluded from this metric as our business in China is predominantly retail. Liz Earle was also excluded from this calculation as it did not distribute through the direct-selling channel. Change in units sold This metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period, as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year. Units sold include samples sold and products contingent upon the purchase of another product (for example, gift with purchase or discount purchase with purchase), but exclude free samples. Change in Average Order This metric is a measure of Representative productivity. The calculation is the difference of the year-over-year change in revenue on a Constant $ basis and the Change in Active Representatives. Change in Average Order may be impacted by a combination of factors such as inflation, units, product mix, and/or pricing. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, including changes in: revenue, operating profit, Adjusted operating profit, operating margin and Adjusted operating margin. We also refer to these adjusted financial measures as Constant $ items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current-year results and prior-year results at a constant exchange rate. Foreign currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant-currency growth rates.\nWe also present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, total and net global expenses, operating profit, operating margin and effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a Non-GAAP basis. We refer to these Non-GAAP financial measures as \"Adjusted.\" We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the Non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement (\"CTI\") restructuring initiatives, 2) costs and charges related to the devaluations of Venezuelan currency in February 2015, March 2014 and February 2013, combined with being designated as a highly inflationary economy, and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela (\"Venezuelan special items\"), 3) the $89 accrual recorded in 2013 for the settlements related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") investigations, the additional $46 accrual in 2014 for the settlements related to the FCPA investigations and, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the associated approximate $19 net tax benefit (\"FCPA accrual\"), 4) the settlement charges associated with the U.S. pension plan (\"Pension settlement charge\"), 5) the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business, and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business (\"Asset impairment and other charges\"), 6) various other items associated with the sale of Liz Earle, the separation of the North America business and debt-related charges (\"Other items\") and, as it relates to our effective tax rate discussion, 7) the non-cash income tax adjustments associated with our deferred tax assets recorded in 2015 and 2014, and an income tax benefit realized as a result of tax planning strategies (\"Special tax items\"). The Company believes investors find the Non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. These Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 caused by the devaluations of Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and non-monetary assets, such as inventories. For non-monetary assets, the Venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical U.S. dollar cost of the assets at the previous\nexchange rate and the revised exchange rate. In 2015 and 2014, the Venezuelan special items also include adjustments of approximately $11 and approximately $116, respectively, to reflect certain non-monetary assets at their net realizable value. In 2015, the Venezuelan special items also include an impairment charge of approximately $90 to reflect the write-down of the long-lived assets to their estimated fair value. In 2013, the devaluation was as a result of the change in the official exchange rate, which moved from 4.30 to 6.30. In 2014, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the official exchange rate of 6.30 to the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50. In 2015, the devaluation was caused as a result of moving from the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50 to the SIMADI exchange rate of approximately 170. The Venezuelan special items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nThe Pension settlement charge includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014 associated with the payments made to former employees who were vested and participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Such payments fully settle our pension plan obligation to those participants who elected to receive such payment.\nThe Asset impairment and other charges include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill impairment charge related to the Egypt business in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Asset impairment and other charges also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the China business in 2013.\nThe Other items include the impact during 2015 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to the gain on the sale of Liz Earle. The Other items also includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 caused by transaction-related costs of $3.1 associated with the planned separation of the North America business that were included in continuing operations. In addition, Other items includes the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the loss on extinguishment of debt caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts associated with the prepayment of our 2.375% Notes (as defined below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Other items also include the impact on other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $2.5 associated with the write-off of issuance costs related to our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility. The Other items, in 2013, also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the prepayment of our private notes issued in 2010, as well as the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the early repayment of $380 of the outstanding principal amount of a term loan agreement. The Other items also include the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2013 caused by the make-whole premium and the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, partially offset by a deferred gain associated with the January 2013 interest-rate swap agreement termination, associated with the prepayment of the notes due in 2014.\nIn addition, the effective tax rate discussion includes Special tax items which include the impact during 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge in the first quarter of 2015 and a non-cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2015, each associated with valuation allowances, to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that was \"more likely than not\" to be realized. These adjustments were primarily caused by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets. The Special tax items also include the impact during the third quarter of 2015 on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge as a result of establishing a valuation allowance for the full amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets due to the impact of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and its associated effect on our tax planning strategies. Additionally, the Special tax items includes the impact on income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge associated with valuation allowances, to adjust certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. The non-U.S. valuation allowance included an adjustment associated with Russia, which was primarily the result of lower earnings, which were significantly impacted by foreign exchange losses on working capital balances. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2014 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to a non-cash income tax charge primarily associated with a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets to an amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized, and was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of some of our key markets and, to a lesser extent, the finalization of the FCPA settlements. The Special tax items also include the impact during the fourth quarter of 2015 on the income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to an income tax benefit recognized as a result of the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies.\nSee Note 14, Restructuring Initiatives on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Results Of Operations - Consolidated\" below, \"Segment Review - Latin America\" below, Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 15, Contingencies on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, \"Segment Review - Global and Other Expense\" below, Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 16, Goodwill and Intangible Assets on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures on pages through of our 2015\nAnnual Report, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below, Note 5, Debt and Other Financing on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report, and Note 7, Income Taxes on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on these items.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. See Note 1, Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nRepresentatives contact their customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a three- to four-week duration. The Representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user. In general, the Representative, an independent contractor, remits a payment to us during each sales campaign, which relates to the prior campaign cycle. The Representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid; however, there are circumstances where the Representative fails to make the required payment. We record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances, including seasonality and changing trends. Over the past three years, annual bad debt expense was $144 in 2015, $171 in 2014 and $209 in 2013, or approximately 2% of total revenue in each year. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. We generally have no detailed information concerning, or any communication with, any end user of our products beyond the Representative. We have no legal recourse against the end user for the collection of any accounts receivable balances due from the Representative to us. If the financial condition of our Representatives were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nAllowances for Sales Returns\nPolicies and practices for product returns vary by jurisdiction, but within many jurisdictions, we generally allow an unlimited right of return. We record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. Over the past three years, annual sales returns were $191 for 2015, $241 for 2014 and $274 for 2013, or approximately 3% of total revenue in each year, which has been generally in line with our expectations. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies, or for other reasons, additional allowances may be required.\nProvisions for Inventory Obsolescence\nWe record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. In determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence, we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision. If actual sales are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence. Annual obsolescence expense was $45 in 2015, $78 in 2014 and $82 in 2013.\nPension and Postretirement Expense\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S. and a portion of employees in international locations. However, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is closed to employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. Additionally, we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care benefits subject to certain limitations to many retired employees in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2015 Annual Report for more information on our benefit plans.\nPension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are generally reviewed and determined on an annual basis. These assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations, the rate of compensation increase of plan participants and mortality rates. We use a December 31 measurement date for all of our employee benefit plans.\nFor 2015, the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets, including the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 6.87%, as compared with 6.86% for 2014. In determining the long-term rates of return, we consider the nature of the plans' investments, an expectation for the plans' investment strategies, historical rates of return and current economic forecasts. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary.\nAs part of the separation of the North America business, we will transfer certain pension liabilities under the U.S. defined benefit pension plan associated with current and former employees of the North America business and certain other former Avon employees, along with a portion of the assets held by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, to a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the new privately-held company. We will also transfer certain other postretirement liabilities (namely, retiree medical and supplemental pension liabilities) in respect of such employees and former employees. We will continue to retain certain U.S. pension and other postretirement liabilities primarily associated with employees who are actively employed by Avon outside of the North America business. Prior to this separation, our net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were allocated between Discontinued Operations and Global and Other Expenses as the plan includes both North America and U.S. Corporate Avon associates. In line with this allocation, our ongoing net periodic benefit costs within Global and Other Expenses are not expected to be materially impacted by the separation of the North America business.\nBeginning in 2014, we adopted an investment strategy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan which is designed to match the movements in the pension liability through an increased allocation towards debt securities. In addition, we also have begun to utilize derivative instruments to achieve the desired market exposures or to hedge certain risks. Derivative instruments may include, but are not limited to, futures, options, swaps or swaptions. Investment types, including the use of derivatives are based on written guidelines established for each investment manager and monitored by the plan's investment committee. In 2015, similar investment strategies were implemented in some of our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nA significant portion of our pension plan assets relate to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The assumed rate of return for 2015 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan was 7.25%, which was based on an asset allocation of approximately 70% in corporate and government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which are expected to earn approximately 3% to 5% in the long-term) and approximately 30% in equity securities and high yield securities (which are expected to earn approximately 5% to 7% in the long term). In addition to the physical assets, the asset portfolio has derivative instruments which increase our exposure to higher yielding securities. Historical rates of return on the assets of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan were approximately 8% for the most recent 10-year period and approximately 8% for the 20-year period. In the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, our asset allocation policy has historically favored U.S. equity securities, which have returned approximately 7% over the 10-year period and approximately 8% over the 20-year period. The rate of return on the plan assets in the U.S. was approximately negative 3% in 2015 and approximately 11% in 2014.\nThe discount rate used for determining the present value of future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of bonds that receive a high-quality rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rates for our more significant plans, including our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high-quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan. The weighted-average discount rate for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans determined on this basis was 3.92% at December 31, 2015, and 3.54% at"}
