Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs, that offer commercial and/or functional advantages to currently available alternatives. We have historically been, and will continue to primarily be, focused on developing and commercializing injectable drugs, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, using the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d)'s 505(b)(2) New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) regulatory pathway. With our addition of Eagle Biologics, we hope to apply our proven market strategy to offer biobetter\u201d formulations, and to rapidly develop novel biologic products under the pathway provided by the Biologics Price & Competition Act. In addition, we plan to continue to market and/or commercialize our products through marketing partners and/or through our internal direct sales force.\nOur product portfolio now includes four approved products: Argatroban; Ryanodex; docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation; and Bendeka. We have three commercial partners: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva\"), which through its subsidiary Cephalon, Inc. (\"Cephalon\"), markets Bendeka, and Chiesi USA, Inc. (\"Chiesi\") and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market Argatroban.\nWe currently have multiple product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our advanced candidates are EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) (\"EP-3101\"), EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\")) ( EP-4104\u201d), EGL-4104-C-1702 (dantrolene sodium for drug induced hyperthermia), EP-5101 (PEMFEXY\u2122), a pemetrexed injection ready-to-dilute formulation ( EP-5101\u201d) and EGL-5385-C-1701 (fulvestrant). EP-3101 and EP-5101 have been tentatively approved by the FDA. EGL-5385-C-1701 and EP-4104, both unapproved, may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 9, 2016, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's board of directors authorizing the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of the Company's common stock (the Share Repurchase Program\u201d). On August 9, 2017, the Company announced a new share repurchase program approved by the Board, under which the Company may repurchase up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock (the New Share Repurchase Program\u201d). Under the Share Repurchase Program and the New Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available capital resources and other financial and operational performance, market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using the Company's cash resources. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to shares repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders' equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. The Company repurchased 566,838 shares of common stock for $37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, and a total of 674,857 shares of common stock for $43.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent ( Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), none of which was drawn at closing. The Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility.\nOn July 26, 2017, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its 505(b)(2) NDA for Ryanodex for the treatment of exertional heat stroke, in conjunction with external cooling methods. Based on our recent meeting with the FDA, we have agreed on a path forward and plan to conduct an additional clinical trial in August 2018 during the Hajj pilgrimage, similar to the study conducted during the Hajj in 2015.\nOn August 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, which amended and restated the Company's existing credit agreement, dated as of January 26, 2017. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility and a three-year $100 million term loan facility (which are collectively referred to as the Amended Credit Facility\u201d). At closing, which occurred on August 8, 2017, $50 million of the term loan facility was drawn, and none of the revolving credit facility has been drawn. The Company may make one other draw on the term loan facility on or before February 4, 2018.The Company has elected not to draw down further on the term loan facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility. The Company anticipates that the draw at closing and future draws under the Amended Credit Facility, if any, will be used to finance the New Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) and for other corporate purposes. Loans under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either\n(a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Amended Credit Facility at a rate ranging from 0.35% to 0.45% per annum based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is permitted to terminate or reduce the revolving commitments or term commitments of the lenders and to make voluntary prepayments at any time subject to break funding payments. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement (a) upon receipt of proceeds from certain sales, transfers or other dispositions, casualty and other condemnation events and the incurrence of certain indebtedness other than indebtedness permitted, subject to customary reinvestment exceptions and (b) in the case that the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Facility exceed the aggregate commitment of all lenders under the Amended Credit Facility.\nOn September 20, 2017, we entered into a Product Collaboration and License Agreement, effective as of September 19, 2017, (the SymBio License\u201d) with SymBio Pharmaceuticals Limited ( SymBio\u201d) for the rights to develop and commercialize EP-3101 and Bendeka (collectively, the Products\u201d) in Japan. Under the SymBio License, SymBio will be responsible for all development of the Products in Japan and for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals of the Products in Japan, with a target for regulatory approval of a Product in Japan in 2020. SymBio will bear all costs of development of the Products in Japan except that, if Japanese regulatory authorities require a certain clinical study to be conducted as a condition for approving one of the Products in Japan, we would share 50% of the out-of-pocket costs of that clinical study up to a specified dollar amount as a reduction to future royalty payments. Based on our assessment of the probability of additional costs, we have not deferred revenue on the SymBio License. SymBio will also be responsible, at its sole cost, for all marketing, promotion, distribution and sales of the Products in Japan and is obligated to launch the Products and meet certain minimum detailing, promotion and marketing commitments in connection with commercialization of the Products in Japan.\nSymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM\u00ae, a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), and as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL. Under the SymBio License, SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM\u00ae in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications.\nPursuant to the terms of the SymBio License, Eagle and SymBio will enter into a separate supply agreement, under which we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Products to SymBio for development and commercialization in Japan. After a period of time following launch of a Product, SymBio will have the right to assume the responsibility for manufacturing of the Products in and for Japan. Under the SymBio License, we will retain the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents covering the Products, both inside and outside of Japan.\nUnder the SymBio License, we earned an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, and we are eligible to receive a milestone payment upon approval of a Product in Japan and a milestone payment upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales of the Products in Japan, which can aggregate to a total of approximately $10.0 million (subject to currency fluctuations). After regulatory approval of a Product in Japan, we will also receive tiered, low double-digit royalties on net sales of the Products in Japan for so long as there are patents covering the Products in Japan or regulatory exclusivity for the Products in Japan.\nOn October 23, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. to conduct a clinical trial for EGL-5385-C-1701. A group study of healthy female subjects have been randomized across 12 sites. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of EGL-5385-C-1701 for Injectable Suspension versus the reference drug administered by IM injection in the gluteal muscle. We expect the study to be completed by September 2018.\nOn October 27, 2017, the FDA granted tentative approval for the Company's EP-5101 for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in patiensts whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy as a single agent; and malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery in combination with cisplatin.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we filed an ANDA for our first product candidate co-developed with AMRI and are awaiting FDA acceptance of the filing.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the stock purchase agreement dated November 10, 2016 (the Arsia SPA\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired from Arsia Therapeutics, LLC (the Seller\u201d) all of the outstanding capital stock of Arsia Therapeutics, Inc. (now Eagle Biologics). Pursuant to the Amendment, our obligations to make four separate milestone\npayments pursuant to the Arsia SPA, which could have aggregated to a total of $48 million, were terminated in exchange for a single payment of $15 million by us to the Seller.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of product sales, royalty revenue and license and other revenue.\nProduct Sales. We recognize revenues from product sales of Bendeka, Ryanodex, Argatroban, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, and diclofenac-misoprostol. Sales of Bendeka are sold to our commercial partner Teva. Argatroban is sold directly to our commercial partners Chiesi and Sandoz. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. Ryanodex, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, launched in February 2016, and diclofenac-misoprostol are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner. Diclofenac-misoprostol was divested in March 2016, however, we may continue to market diclofenac-misoprostol until such time that the purchaser is able to launch the product.\nWe typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of our direct commercial products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have contracted prices for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. These amounts are estimated and recorded at the time of sale. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically pay a chargeback, representing the difference between price invoiced to the wholesaler and the customer contract price.\nRoyalty revenue. We recognize revenue from royalties based on a percentage of Teva's net sales of Bendeka and Sandoz's and Chiesi's gross profit of Argatroban, both net of discounts, returns and allowances incurred by our commercial partners. Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when it can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLicense and other revenue.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nThe primary factors that determine our revenues derived from Bendeka are:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by our commercial partner, Teva;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the rate at which Teva can convert the current market to Bendeka;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of institutional demand for Bendeka;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unit sales prices charged by our commercial partner, net of any sales reserves; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Argatroban are:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and Chiesi;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the level of institutional demand for Argatroban; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unit sales prices charged by our commercial partners, net of any sales reserves.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol and our future products are:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effectiveness of our sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and\ncustoms charges, cost of royalty and the amortization of intangible assets. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nResearch and Development\nCosts for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and include; employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical and preclinical studies, costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities, costs associated with regulatory operations, and depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to the Company by its vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the patterns of costs incurred, and are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as prepaid expenses or accrued expenses as deemed appropriate. Recoveries of previously recognized research and development expenses from third parties are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in the period it becomes realizable.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, marketing, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential of further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we continue to grow our commercial organization.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Further, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the 4th quarter of 2016, the Company reversed its valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets (See Note 8. Income Taxes). ASC 740 also prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenue\n</td> <td>153,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other revenue\n</td> <td>37,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $47.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $236.7 million as compared to $189.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProduct sales increased approximately $4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by increases in product sales of Ryanodex of $5.9 million and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection of $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.2 million in net product sales of Bendeka and $0.4 million in net product sales of Argatroban. In addition, there\nwas a $0.8 million decrease in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol as the Company sold certain intellectual property related to this product in March 2016.\nRoyalty revenue increased $54.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased Bendeka market share on Teva sales amplified by an increase in the Bendeka royalty rate from 20% to 25% upon receipt of the J-code, partially tempered by a decrease in Argatroban royalties.\nLicense and other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized a $25.0 million milestone under the Cephalon agreement related to Teva reaching $500 million in cumulative net sales of Bendeka and a $12.5 million upfront cash payment earned under the SymBio License Agreement. License and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of a $40.0 million milestone related to the receipt of the J-code for Bendeka, $6.0 million recognized from an asset sale in fiscal 2010 (which had previously been deferred), $2.0 million as the Company met certain one-time performance obligations and $1.8 million related to the amendment of the license and supply agreement with Teva, expanding the territories for commercial sale of Bendeka.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease) / Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,071\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty revenue\n</td> <td>23,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $57.2 million as compared to $55.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of product sales decreased $2.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of decreased product sales of Bendeka, Argatroban, and diclofenac-misoprostol, offset by increases in product sales of Ryanodex and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection.\nCost of royalty revenue increased $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of an increase in the cost of product royalty for Bendeka, offset by a decrease in the cost of product royalty for Argatroban.\nResearch and Development\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased approximately $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $32.6 million as compared to $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from an increase in project spending for EGL-5385-C-170, EP-4104, EGL-4104-C-1702, certain other projects and an increase in salary and other personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in project spending for EP-6101 and EP-5101. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016 we received certain cost reimbursements from a commercial partner for $1.6 million and a $2.4 million credit from a supplier related to the resolution of a dispute.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $18.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $71.4 million as compared to $53.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase is principally related to a $10.2 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as we build out areas to support the growing needs of the business and sales force, $3.0 million increase in sales and marketing spend in preparation for the launch of Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke, $1.7 million increase in professional fees mainly for legal matters, $1.4 million increase in amortization expense related to the Biologics developed technology intangible asset, $0.8 million increase in travel related expenses, and a $1.0 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.\nGain on sale of asset\nOn March 29, 2016, we entered into the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold certain intellectual property related to diclofenac-misoprostol in the United States. In consideration of the assets and rights sold under the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement, we received a one-time payment at closing of $1.75 million, which was included in operating expenses.\nAsset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced a decline in customer contracts and saw a drop in market pricing for Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection. Accordingly, the Company estimated the fair value of our Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection product and determined the carrying amount of the intangible asset was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of $7.2 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nContingent consideration, which primarily consists of potential milestone payments and royalty obligations, is recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value at the acquisition date, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in fair value measurement accounting.\nA change in fair value of contingent consideration was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in income of $7.4 million, net. This includes adjustments to the fair values of the liabilities associated with Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, which was remeasured as a result of changes in forecasted revenues for the product. Also included in the amount was a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of Eagle Biologics. In February 2018, the Company amended the Eagle Biologics Stock Purchase Agreement and has paid $15 million for all remaining obligations for milestone payments under that agreement.\nLegal Settlement\nOn February 2, 2016, The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company, SciDose LLC and TherDose Pharma Pvt. Ltd. (collectively the Defendants\u201d) relating to the Defendants' work on a novel ready-to-use bivalirudin injection product ( EP-6101\u201d). MDCO amended that complaint in April of 2016. The complaint cites the May 7, 2008 License and Development Agreement (the LDA\u201d) between the Defendants and MDCO, which was terminated by the Company on September 17, 2013. In October 2017, the Defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to stay discovery. In December 2017, while those motions were pending, the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which Defendants agreed to pay $1.7 million and assign to MDCO all intellectual property rights relating to EP-6101. As a result of the settlement, the parties entered into a stipulation dismissing all claims with prejudice.\nOther Income and Expense\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest incurred on long-term debt.\n(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,002\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded a $21.0 million provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a $28.0 million benefit for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe (provision for) benefit from income taxes were based on the applicable federal and state tax rates for those periods. For periods with a loss before benefit for income taxes, favorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate, while unfavorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate. For periods with income before provision for income taxes, favorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate, while, unfavorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate.\nThe tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects an effective tax rate of 29%. The difference between the notional U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate includes favorable rate items such as exercise of stock options in the period and credits from research and development activity and unfavorable items such as state tax and a valuation adjustment to our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the new U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from tax reform.\nThe tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of a previously carried tax valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards and the tax benefit related to the exercises of stock options during 2016. This was partially offset by the tax on 2016 earnings. Our decision to remove the valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets considered our significant income in 2016 which translated to our becoming a tax payer in 2016 and our outlook on prospective earnings and taxable income driven by Bendeka royalty and milestone revenues.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.9 million as compared to a net income of $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenue\n</td> <td>99,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other revenue\n</td> <td>49,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $123.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $189.5 million as compared to $66.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProduct sales increased approximately $27.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $40.6 million as compared to $13.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to $17.4 million in net product sales of Bendeka (launched in January 2016), $3.9 million in net product sales of Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection (launched in February 2016), an increase of $5.6 million in net product sales of Ryanodex and an increase of $1.0 million in net product sales of Argatroban. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in diclofenac-misoprostol product sales of $0.2 million.\nRoyalty revenue increased $90.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $99.0 million as compared to $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of royalties on Teva sales since the Bendeka launch in January 2016.\nLicense and other revenue increased $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $49.8 million as compared to $45.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the Cephalon License. License and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of a $40.0 million milestone related to the receipt of the J-code for Bendeka, $6.0 million recognized from an asset sale in fiscal 2010 (which had previously been deferred), $2.0 million as the Company met certain one-time performance obligations and $1.8 million related to the amendment of the license and supply agreement with Teva, expanding the territories for commercial sale of Bendeka.

Income Taxes).\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $81.5 million as compared to a net income of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund working capital requirements, product development costs, operating expenses as well as strategic business and product acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents were $114.7 million, and $52.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized net income of $51.9 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had a working capital surplus of $141.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized net income of $81.5 million. Although the Company has incurred significant losses since its inception in January 2007, we recently became profitable and have retained earnings of $26.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital requirements.\nThe Company expects to use future loans, if any, under the Credit Facility (described above under \"Recent Developments\"), for general corporate purposes and any strategic acquisitions.\nOperating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $58.9 million. Net income for the same period was $51.9 million offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $36.5 million principally from deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charge, amortization of debt issuance costs, and change in fair value of contingent consideration. Net changes in working capital decreased cash provided from operating activities by $29.6 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $11.6 million, an increase in inventory of $2.4 million partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $8.5 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $9.1 million. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 was approximately $53.8 million, which included approximately $13.3 million from product sales, $36.4 million from royalty income, and $4.1 million related to cost reimbursements, all with payment terms of 45 days. Royalty income is receivable with terms of 45 days and starts at the end of the quarter to which it relates, the immediately preceding quarter.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $53.2 million. Net income for the same period was $81.5 million reduced by non-cash adjustments of approximately $19.6 million principally from deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense. Net changes in working capital decreased cash provided from operating activities by $8.6 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable of $15.9 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $9.4 million partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $10.7 million, a decrease in inventories of $12.3 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $6.0 million. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 was approximately $42.2 million, which included approximately $10.1 million from product sales and approximately $32.0 million from royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days. Royalty income is receivable with terms of 45 days and starts at the end of the quarter to which it relates, the immediately preceding quarter.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.7 million. Net income for the same period was $2.6 million adjusted by non-cash adjustments of approximately $4.4 million from depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and retirement of fixed assets. Net changes in working capital decreased cash from operating activities by approximately $16.7 million principally due to an increase in accounts receivable of $14.3 million, an increase in inventories of $13.8 million partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $11.9 million. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to accrued royalties payable, accrued cost of revenue, accrued inventory purchases on increased commercial activity, and accrued research and development. Inventories increased significantly in preparation for the launch of Bendeka in January 2016. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to the $15.0 million milestone royalty earned under the Cephalon License agreement. The total amount of accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 was approximately $26.3 million, which included approximately $2.0 million of product sales and approximately $24.2 million of royalty income, all with payment terms of 45 days and approximately $0.1 million of other receivables. Royalty income is receivable with terms of 45 days and starts at the end of the quarter to which it relates, the immediately preceding quarter.\nInvesting Activities:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested $0.8 million related to the purchase of the Ryanodex intangible. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection for $4.8 million, the Ryanodex intangible for $14.3 million and Eagle Biologics for $26.9 million of net cash acquired. We divested diclofenac-misoprostol for proceeds of $1.8 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we invested $62.0 million, and $106.0 million, in U.S. Treasury securities, and redeemed $62.0 million and $106.0 million of short- term investments.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we invested $4.4 million, $1.6 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.1 million, primarily resulting from $50.0 million in proceeds from debt issuance and the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises of $4.3 million. This was offset by $43.8 million in cash settlements on repurchases of common stock, a $1.2 million payment of debt financing costs, and a $1.3 million payment of debt principal.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $33.7 million primarily resulting from $37.0 million in repurchases of 566,838 shares of our common stock and a $0.3 million payment of contingent consideration partially offset by the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises of $3.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $55.8 million primarily resulting from $54.3 million on the issuance of our common stock from the Follow-on Offering and proceeds from stock option exercises of $1.5 million.\nContractual Obligations\nOur future material contractual obligations include the following (in thousands):\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) At December 31, 2017, the Company has purchase obligations in the amount of $61,307 which represent the contractual commitments under contract manufacturing and supply agreements with suppliers.

The remaining future lease payments under the operating lease are $2,494 as of December 31, 2017, payable monthly through June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2027.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance related to Topic 606.\nThe new standard will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under Topic 606, an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates, and also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and estimates used. The new standard also defines accounting for certain costs related to origination and fulfillment of contracts with customers, including whether such costs should be capitalized. The new standard permits adoption either by using (i) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or (ii) a modified retrospective approach where the new standard is applied in the financial statements starting with the year of adoption. Under both approaches, cumulative impact of the adoption is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated equity (deficit)) as of the earliest date presented in accordance with the new standard.\nIn July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (previously December 15, 2016). The Company has implemented the new guidance as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The Company has evaluated Topic 606, and has assessed existing and historical contracts to identify possible differences in the timing of revenue recognition under the new revenue standard. During this evaluation, both senior management and the Audit Committee have been updated as to progress and findings on a frequent basis. The Company has substantially completed our evaluation of the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Adoption of the new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our recognition will be consistent with our historical accounting policies.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which revises the guidance in ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, and provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. We do not expect this ASU to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The adoption of this new standard will increase assets and liabilities on our balance sheet when adopted. We are still fully assessing the overall impact of this ASU on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the measurement of goodwill. The guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under the amendments in this guidance, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss. The guidance also eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed for testing dates after January 1, 2017. The guidance must be adopted on a prospective basis. We do not expect this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The guidance provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business, provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and substantive process are present, and narrows the definition of the term output. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance must be adopted on a prospective basis. We will consider the guidance for future transactions.\nRecent Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. In 2016, we early adopted this ASU. With the adoption of this ASU, the Company continues to estimate forfeitures in the calculation of stock-based compensation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nImpact of Inflation\nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions\nand conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nWe regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate\u201d where:\n\u2022the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n\u2022the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Not all of these significant accounting policies, however, require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates.\u201d We have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition, accounting for fair value of warrant liabilities and share-based compensation described below are critical accounting estimates.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Royalty revenues, based on net sales by licensees, are recorded as revenue for the period in which those sales are made by the licensees. License fees are recorded over the life of the license. Deferred revenue is recognized upon the achievement of milestones. Other deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the underlying agreement.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.\nProduct sales. We recognize net revenues from products manufactured and supplied to our commercial partners, when the following four basic revenue recognition criteria under the related accounting guidance are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Prior to the shipment of our manufactured products, we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Sales to our commercial partners are presented gross primarily because the Company is the primary obligor in the arrangement, is responsible to ensure that the product is produced in accordance with the related supply agreement and bears risk of loss while the inventory is in-transit to the commercial partner.\nRevenue on sales to end users for Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol are recorded net of chargebacks, rebates, returns, prompt pay discounts, wholesaler fees and other deductions. Our products are contracted with a limited number of oncology distributors and hospital buying groups with narrow differences in ultimate realized contract prices used to estimate our chargeback and rebate reserves. The Company has a product returns policy on some of its products that allows the customer to return pharmaceutical products within a specified period of time both prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. The Company's estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors, including historical experience of actual returns and analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel, if any. The Company has terms on sales of Ryanodex by which the Company does not accept returns. The Company believes that the reserves it has established are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances. Applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances could result in the estimated amount for reserves to vary.\nRoyalty revenue. We recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners' net sales of products. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within 60 days from the end of each quarter. Based on historical product sales, royalty receipts and other relevant information, we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true-up when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners.\nCollaborative arrangements. We recognize revenue from reimbursements received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties when our contractual services are performed, provided collectability is reasonably assured. Our principal costs under these arrangements include our personnel conducting research and development, and our allocated overhead, as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants.\nWe recognize revenues from non-refundable up-front license fees received under collaboration arrangements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement (estimated development period in the case of development\narrangements, and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution arrangements). If the estimated performance period is subsequently modified, we will modify the period over which the up-front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis. Upon termination of a collaboration agreement, any remaining non-refundable license fees received by us, which had been deferred, are generally recognized in full. All such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our statements of operations. We recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration arrangements when earned, provided that the milestone event is substantive, its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, we have no further performance obligations relating to the event and collectability is reasonably assured. If these criteria are not met, we recognize milestone payments ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the collaboration agreement.\nStock-based compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation under ASC, 718 \"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.\" All stock-based awards granted to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with ASC 718, and ASC 505, \" Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,\" under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date.\nWe account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term, forfeitures and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined with the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options. In 2016, as we adopted ASU 2016-09, we made a policy election to estimate forfeitures in the calculation of stock based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. We have not identified any uncertain income tax positions that could have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nOur definite-lived intangible assets include product licenses, product rights and developed technology. These intangible assets were originally recorded at fair value for business combinations and at relative fair value based on the purchase price for asset acquisitions, and are stated net of accumulated amortization. Each intangible asset is amortized over their remaining estimated useful life, ranging from 5 to 20 years. The estimated useful lives directly impact the amount of amortization expense recorded for these assets on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, we test for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Judgment is used in determining when these events and circumstances arise. If we determine that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, judgment and estimates are used to assess the fair value of the assets and to determine the amount of any impairment loss. If the fair value of an intangible asset is determined to be lower than its carrying value, we could be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill relates to the acquisition of Eagle Biologics and represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. As a result, the amount of goodwill is directly impacted by the estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill\nmight not be recoverable. Judgment is used in determining when these events and circumstances arise. We perform our review of goodwill on our one reporting unit. If we determine that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, judgment and estimates are used to assess the fair value of the assets and to determine the amount of any impairment loss.\nContingent consideration\nWe have agreements with third-parties with contingent consideration and milestone payments that are potentially payable by us, as more fully described in Note 12, Acquisitions\u201d in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are contingent upon achieving sales, development and/or regulatory milestones that may or may not ever be achieved. Therefore, our requirement to make or receive such payments in the future or at all is highly uncertain.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's business model, product portfolio, commercial partners, financial operations, and recent developments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs, that offer commercial and/or functional advantages to currently available alternatives. We have historically been, and will continue to primarily be, focused on developing and commercializing injectable drugs, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, using the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d)'s 505(b)(2) New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) regulatory pathway. With our addition of Eagle Biologics, we hope to apply our proven market strategy to offer biobetter\u201d formulations, and to rapidly develop novel biologic products under the pathway provided by the Biologics Price & Competition Act. In addition, we plan to continue to market and/or commercialize our products through marketing partners and/or through our internal direct sales force.\nOur product portfolio now includes four approved products: Argatroban; Ryanodex; docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation; and Bendeka. We have three commercial partners: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva\"), which through its subsidiary Cephalon, Inc. (\"Cephalon\"), markets Bendeka, and Chiesi USA, Inc. (\"Chiesi\") and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market Argatroban.\nWe currently have multiple product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our advanced candidates are EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) (\"EP-3101\"), EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\")) ( EP-4104\u201d), EGL-4104-C-1702 (dantrolene sodium for drug induced hyperthermia), EP-5101 (PEMFEXY\u2122), a pemetrexed injection ready-to-dilute formulation ( EP-5101\u201d) and EGL-5385-C-1701 (fulvestrant). EP-3101 and EP-5101 have been tentatively approved by the FDA. EGL-5385-C-1701 and EP-4104, both unapproved, may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 9, 2016, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's board of directors authorizing the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of the Company's common stock (the Share Repurchase Program\u201d). On August 9, 2017, the Company announced a new share repurchase program approved by the Board, under which the Company may repurchase up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock (the New Share Repurchase Program\u201d). Under the Share Repurchase Program and the New Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available capital resources and other financial and operational performance, market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using the Company's cash resources. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to shares repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders' equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. The Company repurchased 566,838 shares of common stock for $37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, and a total of 674,857 shares of common stock for $43.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent ( Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), none of which was drawn at closing. The Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility.\nOn July 26, 2017, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its 505(b)(2) NDA for Ryanodex for the treatment of exertional heat stroke, in conjunction with external cooling methods. Based on our recent meeting with the FDA, we have agreed on a path forward and plan to conduct an additional clinical trial in August 2018 during the Hajj pilgrimage, similar to the study conducted during the Hajj in 2015.\nOn August 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, which amended and restated the Company's existing credit agreement, dated as of January 26, 2017. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility and a three-year $100 million term loan facility (which are collectively referred to as the Amended Credit Facility\u201d). At closing, which occurred on August 8, 2017, $50 million of the term loan facility was drawn, and none of the revolving credit facility has been drawn. The Company may make one other draw on the term loan facility on or before February 4, 2018.The Company has elected not to draw down further on the term loan facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility. The Company anticipates that the draw at closing and future draws under the Amended Credit Facility, if any, will be used to finance the New Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) and for other corporate purposes. Loans under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either\n(a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Amended Credit Facility at a rate ranging from 0.35% to 0.45% per annum based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is permitted to terminate or reduce the revolving commitments or term commitments of the lenders and to make voluntary prepayments at any time subject to break funding payments. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement (a) upon receipt of proceeds from certain sales, transfers or other dispositions, casualty and other condemnation events and the incurrence of certain indebtedness other than indebtedness permitted, subject to customary reinvestment exceptions and (b) in the case that the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Facility exceed the aggregate commitment of all lenders under the Amended Credit Facility.\nOn September 20, 2017, we entered into a Product Collaboration and License Agreement, effective as of September 19, 2017, (the SymBio License\u201d) with SymBio Pharmaceuticals Limited ( SymBio\u201d) for the rights to develop and commercialize EP-3101 and Bendeka (collectively, the Products\u201d) in Japan. Under the SymBio License, SymBio will be responsible for all development of the Products in Japan and for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals of the Products in Japan, with a target for regulatory approval of a Product in Japan in 2020. SymBio will bear all costs of development of the Products in Japan except that, if Japanese regulatory authorities require a certain clinical study to be conducted as a condition for approving one of the Products in Japan, we would share 50% of the out-of-pocket costs of that clinical study up to a specified dollar amount as a reduction to future royalty payments. Based on our assessment of the probability of additional costs, we have not deferred revenue on the SymBio License. SymBio will also be responsible, at its sole cost, for all marketing, promotion, distribution and sales of the Products in Japan and is obligated to launch the Products and meet certain minimum detailing, promotion and marketing commitments in connection with commercialization of the Products in Japan.\nSymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM\u00ae, a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), and as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL. Under the SymBio License, SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM\u00ae in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications.\nPursuant to the terms of the SymBio License, Eagle and SymBio will enter into a separate supply agreement, under which we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Products to SymBio for development and commercialization in Japan. After a period of time following launch of a Product, SymBio will have the right to assume the responsibility for manufacturing of the Products in and for Japan. Under the SymBio License, we will retain the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents covering the Products, both inside and outside of Japan.\nUnder the SymBio License, we earned an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, and we are eligible to receive a milestone payment upon approval of a Product in Japan and a milestone payment upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales of the Products in Japan, which can aggregate to a total of approximately $10.0 million (subject to currency fluctuations). After regulatory approval of a Product in Japan, we will also receive tiered, low double-digit royalties on net sales of the Products in Japan for so long as there are patents covering the Products in Japan or regulatory exclusivity for the Products in Japan.\nOn October 23, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. to conduct a clinical trial for EGL-5385-C-1701. A group study of healthy female subjects have been randomized across 12 sites. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of EGL-5385-C-1701 for Injectable Suspension versus the reference drug administered by IM injection in the gluteal muscle. We expect the study to be completed by September 2018.\nOn October 27, 2017, the FDA granted tentative approval for the Company's EP-5101 for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in patiensts whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy as a single agent; and malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery in combination with cisplatin.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we filed an ANDA for our first product candidate co-developed with AMRI and are awaiting FDA acceptance of the filing.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the stock purchase agreement dated November 10, 2016 (the Arsia SPA\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired from Arsia Therapeutics, LLC (the Seller\u201d) all of the outstanding capital stock of Arsia Therapeutics, Inc. (now Eagle Biologics). Pursuant to the Amendment, our obligations to make four separate milestone\npayments pursuant to the Arsia SPA, which could have aggregated to a total of $48 million, were terminated in exchange for a single payment of $15 million by us to the Seller.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of product sales, royalty revenue and license and other revenue.\nProduct Sales. We recognize revenues from product sales of Bendeka, Ryanodex, Argatroban, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, and diclofenac-misoprostol. Sales of Bendeka are sold to our commercial partner Teva. Argatroban is sold directly to our commercial partners Chiesi and Sandoz. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. Ryanodex, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, launched in February 2016, and diclofenac-misoprostol are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner. Diclofenac-misoprostol was divested in March 2016, however, we may continue to market diclofenac-misoprostol until such time that the purchaser is able to launch the product.\nWe typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of our direct commercial products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have contracted prices for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. These amounts are estimated and recorded at the time of sale. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically pay a chargeback, representing the difference between price invoiced to the wholesaler and the customer contract price.\nRoyalty revenue. We recognize revenue from royalties based on a percentage of Teva's net sales of Bendeka and Sandoz's and Chiesi's gross profit of Argatroban, both net of discounts, returns and allowances incurred by our commercial partners. Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when it can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLicense and other revenue.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nThe primary factors that determine our revenues derived from Bendeka are:\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partner, Teva; \n \u2022 the rate at which Teva can convert the current market to Bendeka; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for Bendeka; \n \u2022 unit sales prices charged by our commercial partner, net of any sales reserves; and \n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Argatroban are:\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and Chiesi; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for Argatroban; and \n \u2022 unit sales prices charged by our commercial partners, net of any sales reserves.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol and our future products are:\n \u2022 the effectiveness of our sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Spectrum\"); \n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for our products; and \n \u2022 unit sales prices, net of any sales reserves.  Cost of Revenues\nCost of revenue consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners. In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and\ncustoms charges, cost of royalty and the amortization of intangible assets. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nResearch and Development\nCosts for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and include; employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical and preclinical studies, costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities, costs associated with regulatory operations, and depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to the Company by its vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the patterns of costs incurred, and are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as prepaid expenses or accrued expenses as deemed appropriate. Recoveries of previously recognized research and development expenses from third parties are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in the period it becomes realizable.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, marketing, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential of further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we continue to grow our commercial organization.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Further, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the 4th quarter of 2016, the Company reversed its valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets (See Note 8. Income Taxes). ASC 740 also prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenue increased $47.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $236.7 million as compared to $189.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProduct sales increased approximately $4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by increases in product sales of Ryanodex of $5.9 million and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection of $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.2 million in net product sales of Bendeka and $0.4 million in net product sales of Argatroban. In addition, there\nwas a $0.8 million decrease in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol as the Company sold certain intellectual property related to this product in March 2016.\nRoyalty revenue increased $54.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased Bendeka market share on Teva sales amplified by an increase in the Bendeka royalty rate from 20% to 25% upon receipt of the J-code, partially tempered by a decrease in Argatroban royalties.\nLicense and other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized a $25.0 million milestone under the Cephalon agreement related to Teva reaching $500 million in cumulative net sales of Bendeka and a $12.5 million upfront cash payment earned under the SymBio License Agreement. License and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of a $40.0 million milestone related to the receipt of the J-code for Bendeka, $6.0 million recognized from an asset sale in fiscal 2010 (which had previously been deferred), $2.0 million as the Company met certain one-time performance obligations and $1.8 million related to the amendment of the license and supply agreement with Teva, expanding the territories for commercial sale of Bendeka.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $57.2 million as compared to $55.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of product sales decreased $2.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of decreased product sales of Bendeka, Argatroban, and diclofenac-misoprostol, offset by increases in product sales of Ryanodex and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection.\nCost of royalty revenue increased $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of an increase in the cost of product royalty for Bendeka, offset by a decrease in the cost of product royalty for Argatroban.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased approximately $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $32.6 million as compared to $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from an increase in project spending for EGL-5385-C-170, EP-4104, EGL-4104-C-1702, certain other projects and an increase in salary and other personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in project spending for EP-6101 and EP-5101. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016 we received certain cost reimbursements from a commercial partner for $1.6 million and a $2.4 million credit from a supplier related to the resolution of a dispute.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $18.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $71.4 million as compared to $53.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase is principally related to a $10.2 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as we build out areas to support the growing needs of the business and sales force, $3.0 million increase in sales and marketing spend in preparation for the launch of Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke, $1.7 million increase in professional fees mainly for legal matters, $1.4 million increase in amortization expense related to the Biologics developed technology intangible asset, $0.8 million increase in travel related expenses, and a $1.0 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.\nGain on sale of asset\nOn March 29, 2016, we entered into the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold certain intellectual property related to diclofenac-misoprostol in the United States. In consideration of the assets and rights sold under the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement, we received a one-time payment at closing of $1.75 million, which was included in operating expenses.\nAsset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced a decline in customer contracts and saw a drop in market pricing for Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection. Accordingly, the Company estimated the fair value of our Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection product and determined the carrying amount of the intangible asset was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of $7.2 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nContingent consideration, which primarily consists of potential milestone payments and royalty obligations, is recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value at the acquisition date, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in fair value measurement accounting.\nA change in fair value of contingent consideration was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in income of $7.4 million, net. This includes adjustments to the fair values of the liabilities associated with Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, which was remeasured as a result of changes in forecasted revenues for the product. Also included in the amount was a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of Eagle Biologics. In February 2018, the Company amended the Eagle Biologics Stock Purchase Agreement and has paid $15 million for all remaining obligations for milestone payments under that agreement.\nLegal Settlement\nOn February 2, 2016, The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company, SciDose LLC and TherDose Pharma Pvt. Ltd. (collectively the Defendants\u201d) relating to the Defendants' work on a novel ready-to-use bivalirudin injection product ( EP-6101\u201d). MDCO amended that complaint in April of 2016. The complaint cites the May 7, 2008 License and Development Agreement (the LDA\u201d) between the Defendants and MDCO, which was terminated by the Company on September 17, 2013. In October 2017, the Defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to stay discovery. In December 2017, while those motions were pending, the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which Defendants agreed to pay $1.7 million and assign to MDCO all intellectual property rights relating to EP-6101. As a result of the settlement, the parties entered into a stipulation dismissing all claims with prejudice.\nOther Income and Expense\n\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest incurred on long-term debt.\n(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\n\nWe recorded a $21.0 million provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a $28.0 million benefit for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe (provision for) benefit from income taxes were based on the applicable federal and state tax rates for those periods. For periods with a loss before benefit for income taxes, favorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate, while unfavorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate. For periods with income before provision for income taxes, favorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate, while, unfavorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate.\nThe tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects an effective tax rate of 29%. The difference between the notional U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate includes favorable rate items such as exercise of stock options in the period and credits from research and development activity and unfavorable items such as state tax and a valuation adjustment to our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the new U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from tax reform.\nThe tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of a previously carried tax valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards and the tax benefit related to the exercises of stock options during 2016. This was partially offset by the tax on 2016 earnings. Our decision to remove the valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets considered our significant income in 2016 which translated to our becoming a tax payer in 2016 and our outlook on prospective earnings and taxable income driven by Bendeka royalty and milestone revenues.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.9 million as compared to a net income of $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRevenues\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, Part I, Item 1, Business\u201d and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results, or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs, that offer commercial and/or functional advantages to currently available alternatives. We have historically been, and will continue to primarily be, focused on developing and commercializing injectable drugs, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, using the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d)'s 505(b)(2) New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) regulatory pathway. With our addition of Eagle Biologics, we hope to apply our proven market strategy to offer biobetter\u201d formulations, and to rapidly develop novel biologic products under the pathway provided by the Biologics Price & Competition Act. In addition, we plan to continue to market and/or commercialize our products through marketing partners and/or through our internal direct sales force.\nOur product portfolio now includes four approved products: Argatroban; Ryanodex; docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation; and Bendeka. We have three commercial partners: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva\"), which through its subsidiary Cephalon, Inc. (\"Cephalon\"), markets Bendeka, and Chiesi USA, Inc. (\"Chiesi\") and Sandoz Inc. ( Sandoz\u201d), who pursuant to separate agreements market Argatroban.\nWe currently have multiple product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\"AMRI\"). Our advanced candidates are EP-3101 (bendamustine RTD) (\"EP-3101\"), EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium for exertional heat stroke (\"EHS\")) ( EP-4104\u201d), EGL-4104-C-1702 (dantrolene sodium for drug induced hyperthermia), EP-5101 (PEMFEXY\u2122), a pemetrexed injection ready-to-dilute formulation ( EP-5101\u201d) and EGL-5385-C-1701 (fulvestrant). EP-3101 and EP-5101 have been tentatively approved by the FDA. EGL-5385-C-1701 and EP-4104, both unapproved, may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 9, 2016, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's board of directors authorizing the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of the Company's common stock (the Share Repurchase Program\u201d). On August 9, 2017, the Company announced a new share repurchase program approved by the Board, under which the Company may repurchase up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock (the New Share Repurchase Program\u201d). Under the Share Repurchase Program and the New Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available capital resources and other financial and operational performance, market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using the Company's cash resources. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to shares repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders' equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. The Company repurchased 566,838 shares of common stock for $37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, and a total of 674,857 shares of common stock for $43.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn January 26, 2017, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent ( Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), none of which was drawn at closing. The Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility.\nOn July 26, 2017, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its 505(b)(2) NDA for Ryanodex for the treatment of exertional heat stroke, in conjunction with external cooling methods. Based on our recent meeting with the FDA, we have agreed on a path forward and plan to conduct an additional clinical trial in August 2018 during the Hajj pilgrimage, similar to the study conducted during the Hajj in 2015.\nOn August 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, which amended and restated the Company's existing credit agreement, dated as of January 26, 2017. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a three-year $50 million revolving credit facility and a three-year $100 million term loan facility (which are collectively referred to as the Amended Credit Facility\u201d). At closing, which occurred on August 8, 2017, $50 million of the term loan facility was drawn, and none of the revolving credit facility has been drawn. The Company may make one other draw on the term loan facility on or before February 4, 2018.The Company has elected not to draw down further on the term loan facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes a $5 million letter of credit subfacility. The Company anticipates that the draw at closing and future draws under the Amended Credit Facility, if any, will be used to finance the New Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) and for other corporate purposes. Loans under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either\n(a) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (b) the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% per annum, based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Amended Credit Facility at a rate ranging from 0.35% to 0.45% per annum based upon the total net leverage ratio. The Company is permitted to terminate or reduce the revolving commitments or term commitments of the lenders and to make voluntary prepayments at any time subject to break funding payments. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement (a) upon receipt of proceeds from certain sales, transfers or other dispositions, casualty and other condemnation events and the incurrence of certain indebtedness other than indebtedness permitted, subject to customary reinvestment exceptions and (b) in the case that the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Facility exceed the aggregate commitment of all lenders under the Amended Credit Facility.\nOn September 20, 2017, we entered into a Product Collaboration and License Agreement, effective as of September 19, 2017, (the SymBio License\u201d) with SymBio Pharmaceuticals Limited ( SymBio\u201d) for the rights to develop and commercialize EP-3101 and Bendeka (collectively, the Products\u201d) in Japan. Under the SymBio License, SymBio will be responsible for all development of the Products in Japan and for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals of the Products in Japan, with a target for regulatory approval of a Product in Japan in 2020. SymBio will bear all costs of development of the Products in Japan except that, if Japanese regulatory authorities require a certain clinical study to be conducted as a condition for approving one of the Products in Japan, we would share 50% of the out-of-pocket costs of that clinical study up to a specified dollar amount as a reduction to future royalty payments. Based on our assessment of the probability of additional costs, we have not deferred revenue on the SymBio License. SymBio will also be responsible, at its sole cost, for all marketing, promotion, distribution and sales of the Products in Japan and is obligated to launch the Products and meet certain minimum detailing, promotion and marketing commitments in connection with commercialization of the Products in Japan.\nSymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM\u00ae, a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), and as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL. Under the SymBio License, SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM\u00ae in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications.\nPursuant to the terms of the SymBio License, Eagle and SymBio will enter into a separate supply agreement, under which we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Products to SymBio for development and commercialization in Japan. After a period of time following launch of a Product, SymBio will have the right to assume the responsibility for manufacturing of the Products in and for Japan. Under the SymBio License, we will retain the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents covering the Products, both inside and outside of Japan.\nUnder the SymBio License, we earned an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, and we are eligible to receive a milestone payment upon approval of a Product in Japan and a milestone payment upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales of the Products in Japan, which can aggregate to a total of approximately $10.0 million (subject to currency fluctuations). After regulatory approval of a Product in Japan, we will also receive tiered, low double-digit royalties on net sales of the Products in Japan for so long as there are patents covering the Products in Japan or regulatory exclusivity for the Products in Japan.\nOn October 23, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. to conduct a clinical trial for EGL-5385-C-1701. A group study of healthy female subjects have been randomized across 12 sites. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of EGL-5385-C-1701 for Injectable Suspension versus the reference drug administered by IM injection in the gluteal muscle. We expect the study to be completed by September 2018.\nOn October 27, 2017, the FDA granted tentative approval for the Company's EP-5101 for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in patiensts whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy as a single agent; and malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery in combination with cisplatin.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we filed an ANDA for our first product candidate co-developed with AMRI and are awaiting FDA acceptance of the filing.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the stock purchase agreement dated November 10, 2016 (the Arsia SPA\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired from Arsia Therapeutics, LLC (the Seller\u201d) all of the outstanding capital stock of Arsia Therapeutics, Inc. (now Eagle Biologics). Pursuant to the Amendment, our obligations to make four separate milestone\npayments pursuant to the Arsia SPA, which could have aggregated to a total of $48 million, were terminated in exchange for a single payment of $15 million by us to the Seller.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of product sales, royalty revenue and license and other revenue.\nProduct Sales. We recognize revenues from product sales of Bendeka, Ryanodex, Argatroban, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, and diclofenac-misoprostol. Sales of Bendeka are sold to our commercial partner Teva. Argatroban is sold directly to our commercial partners Chiesi and Sandoz. Sales to our commercial partners are typically made at little or no profit for resale. Ryanodex, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, launched in February 2016, and diclofenac-misoprostol are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third party logistics partner. Diclofenac-misoprostol was divested in March 2016, however, we may continue to market diclofenac-misoprostol until such time that the purchaser is able to launch the product.\nWe typically enter into agreements with group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members, in connection with the hospitals' purchases of our direct commercial products. Based on these agreements, most of our hospital customers have contracted prices for products and volume-based rebates on product purchases. These amounts are estimated and recorded at the time of sale. In the case of discounted pricing, we typically pay a chargeback, representing the difference between price invoiced to the wholesaler and the customer contract price.\nRoyalty revenue. We recognize revenue from royalties based on a percentage of Teva's net sales of Bendeka and Sandoz's and Chiesi's gross profit of Argatroban, both net of discounts, returns and allowances incurred by our commercial partners. Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when it can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLicense and other revenue.\nOur revenues may either be in the form of the recognition of deferred revenues upon milestone achievement for which cash has already been received or recognition of revenue upon milestone achievement, the payment for which is reasonably assured to be received in the future.\nThe primary factors that determine our revenues derived from Bendeka are:\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partner, Teva; \n \u2022 the rate at which Teva can convert the current market to Bendeka; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for Bendeka; \n \u2022 unit sales prices charged by our commercial partner, net of any sales reserves; and \n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Argatroban are:\n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners, Sandoz and Chiesi; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for Argatroban; and \n \u2022 unit sales prices charged by our commercial partners, net of any sales reserves.  The primary factors that may determine our revenues derived from Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, Ryanodex and diclofenac-misoprostol and our future products are:\n \u2022 the effectiveness of our sales force and co-promotion partner, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Spectrum\"); \n \u2022 the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers; \n \u2022 the level of institutional demand for our products; and \n \u2022 unit sales prices, net of any sales reserves.  Cost of Revenues\nCost of revenue consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners. In particular, our cost of revenue includes production costs of our products paid to a contract manufacturing organization coupled with shipping and\ncustoms charges, cost of royalty and the amortization of intangible assets. Cost of revenue may also include the effects of product recalls, if applicable.\nResearch and Development\nCosts for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and include; employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel, expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical and preclinical studies, costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities, costs associated with regulatory operations, and depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.\nCosts for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to the Company by its vendors on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the patterns of costs incurred, and are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as prepaid expenses or accrued expenses as deemed appropriate. Recoveries of previously recognized research and development expenses from third parties are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in the period it becomes realizable.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for executive, finance, selling and operations personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, selling, marketing, market research, advisory board and key opinion leaders, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase with the potential of further commercialization of our product candidates particularly as we continue to grow our commercial organization.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d), Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Further, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the 4th quarter of 2016, the Company reversed its valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets (See Note 8. Income Taxes). ASC 740 also prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nRevenues\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenue\n</td> <td>153,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other revenue\n</td> <td>37,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $47.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $236.7 million as compared to $189.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProduct sales increased approximately $4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by increases in product sales of Ryanodex of $5.9 million and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection of $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.2 million in net product sales of Bendeka and $0.4 million in net product sales of Argatroban. In addition, there\nwas a $0.8 million decrease in net product sales of diclofenac-misoprostol as the Company sold certain intellectual property related to this product in March 2016.\nRoyalty revenue increased $54.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased Bendeka market share on Teva sales amplified by an increase in the Bendeka royalty rate from 20% to 25% upon receipt of the J-code, partially tempered by a decrease in Argatroban royalties.\nLicense and other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized a $25.0 million milestone under the Cephalon agreement related to Teva reaching $500 million in cumulative net sales of Bendeka and a $12.5 million upfront cash payment earned under the SymBio License Agreement. License and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of a $40.0 million milestone related to the receipt of the J-code for Bendeka, $6.0 million recognized from an asset sale in fiscal 2010 (which had previously been deferred), $2.0 million as the Company met certain one-time performance obligations and $1.8 million related to the amendment of the license and supply agreement with Teva, expanding the territories for commercial sale of Bendeka.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease) / Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,071\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty revenue\n</td> <td>23,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $57.2 million as compared to $55.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of product sales decreased $2.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of decreased product sales of Bendeka, Argatroban, and diclofenac-misoprostol, offset by increases in product sales of Ryanodex and Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection.\nCost of royalty revenue increased $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of an increase in the cost of product royalty for Bendeka, offset by a decrease in the cost of product royalty for Argatroban.\nResearch and Development\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased approximately $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $32.6 million as compared to $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from an increase in project spending for EGL-5385-C-170, EP-4104, EGL-4104-C-1702, certain other projects and an increase in salary and other personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in project spending for EP-6101 and EP-5101. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016 we received certain cost reimbursements from a commercial partner for $1.6 million and a $2.4 million credit from a supplier related to the resolution of a dispute.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $18.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $71.4 million as compared to $53.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase is principally related to a $10.2 million increase in salary and personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as we build out areas to support the growing needs of the business and sales force, $3.0 million increase in sales and marketing spend in preparation for the launch of Ryanodex for exertional heat stroke, $1.7 million increase in professional fees mainly for legal matters, $1.4 million increase in amortization expense related to the Biologics developed technology intangible asset, $0.8 million increase in travel related expenses, and a $1.0 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.\nGain on sale of asset\nOn March 29, 2016, we entered into the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold certain intellectual property related to diclofenac-misoprostol in the United States. In consideration of the assets and rights sold under the Diclofenac Asset Purchase Agreement, we received a one-time payment at closing of $1.75 million, which was included in operating expenses.\nAsset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced a decline in customer contracts and saw a drop in market pricing for Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection. Accordingly, the Company estimated the fair value of our Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection product and determined the carrying amount of the intangible asset was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of $7.2 million.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nContingent consideration, which primarily consists of potential milestone payments and royalty obligations, is recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value at the acquisition date, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in fair value measurement accounting.\nA change in fair value of contingent consideration was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in income of $7.4 million, net. This includes adjustments to the fair values of the liabilities associated with Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, which was remeasured as a result of changes in forecasted revenues for the product. Also included in the amount was a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of Eagle Biologics. In February 2018, the Company amended the Eagle Biologics Stock Purchase Agreement and has paid $15 million for all remaining obligations for milestone payments under that agreement.\nLegal Settlement\nOn February 2, 2016, The Medicines Company ( MDCO\u201d) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company, SciDose LLC and TherDose Pharma Pvt. Ltd. (collectively the Defendants\u201d) relating to the Defendants' work on a novel ready-to-use bivalirudin injection product ( EP-6101\u201d). MDCO amended that complaint in April of 2016. The complaint cites the May 7, 2008 License and Development Agreement (the LDA\u201d) between the Defendants and MDCO, which was terminated by the Company on September 17, 2013. In October 2017, the Defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to stay discovery. In December 2017, while those motions were pending, the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which Defendants agreed to pay $1.7 million and assign to MDCO all intellectual property rights relating to EP-6101. As a result of the settlement, the parties entered into a stipulation dismissing all claims with prejudice.\nOther Income and Expense\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest incurred on long-term debt.\n(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,002\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recorded a $21.0 million provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a $28.0 million benefit for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe (provision for) benefit from income taxes were based on the applicable federal and state tax rates for those periods. For periods with a loss before benefit for income taxes, favorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate, while unfavorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate. For periods with income before provision for income taxes, favorable tax items result in a decrease in the effective tax rate, while, unfavorable tax items result in an increase in the effective tax rate.\nThe tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects an effective tax rate of 29%. The difference between the notional U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate includes favorable rate items such as exercise of stock options in the period and credits from research and development activity and unfavorable items such as state tax and a valuation adjustment to our net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the new U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from tax reform.\nThe tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of a previously carried tax valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards and the tax benefit related to the exercises of stock options during 2016. This was partially offset by the tax on 2016 earnings. Our decision to remove the valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets considered our significant income in 2016 which translated to our becoming a tax payer in 2016 and our outlook on prospective earnings and taxable income driven by Bendeka royalty and milestone revenues.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.9 million as compared to a net income of $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the factors discussed above.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td>"}
