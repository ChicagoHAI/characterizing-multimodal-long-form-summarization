The Fund's profits were primarily attributable to interest rates, energy, metals, and stock indices sectors. The currency and agriculture sectors posted losses.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Price action resulted from monetary policy actions by major central banks that led to a strong rally in bonds. The bond sector contained the majority of the best performing individual markets, with the U.S. 5 year note posting the strongest gains. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. February was difficult for fixed income, which experienced weak performance at the start of the month. However, after the Greek crisis found some resolution, European bonds traded lower in yield terms, particularly the German Bund and Italian BTPs. Elsewhere the U.S. and UK saw weakness in fixed income throughout February with yields rallying back to where they were at the start of the year. After the strong gains in fixed income in January, the Trading Program suffered a small relative loss on its fixed income positioning in\nFebruary. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. It was a tough start to March for fixed income which saw yields initially go higher. However with the European Central Bank ratcheting up bond purchases and a commitment to buying bonds even with negative yields, European bonds traded lower. In the U.S., treasuries found a buyer in the medium to long term part of the curve. Accordingly, the Fund benefited from its continued long bias to the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the fixed income sector saw a positive start as yields fell in major developed bond markets. However, a reversal towards the end of April erased performance, with yields in Germany rallying off the lows to end April. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Losses were led by the bond sector as bond markets experienced volatility and price declines. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Long positioning across fixed income markets continued through June. German bonds continued to sell off in June. Investor concerns over liquidity and inventory levels played out in volatile short term moves. Long positioning in the Japanese 10 YR accounted for the biggest losses in the bond sector. Eurodollar was the largest detractor in the rates sector with varied exposure throughout June, ending June with long exposure. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, the Fund benefited from a long bias in bonds as bonds rallied towards the end of July. The largest positive contributor in the sector was the long EURO-BTP, with positive contributions from significant long positions in the U.S. 5 year and Japan 10 year bonds. The risk steadily increased throughout July. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The Fund managed a positive return from fixed income in August, with the Eurodollar and the U.K. gilts amongst the best performers. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Short term interest rates were mainly seen in the Eurodollar and Brazilian contracts where both had large moves and resulted in strong positive performance. The Eurodollar moved higher after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and continued to trend higher in September. Brazilian short term rates moved aggressively higher as the currency sold off to lows versus the U.S. dollar. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The market was in a general slump starting October ensuing from the Federal Reserve not raising rates in September. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund continued with its net long bond (short yields) positioning throughout November. The start of the month saw a strong rally in yields, however, this was short lived and the rest of the month saw a reverting move back in yields. This was especially apparent in Europe with German and Italian government bonds reverting to the lows of the year (in yield terms). The U.S. 10 year bond was slower to return to lower yield levels and closed November slightly higher. European bonds rallied and U.S. and Asian bonds ended the month in negative performance territory causing the fixed income space to post a negative return for the month. Long positioning in the EURO-BTP was the largest contributor. The Australian 10 year bond started the month with long exposure where it negatively contributed to performance, ending the month as the top detractor in the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund continued with its long bonds (short yields) delta throughout December. The majority of the losses in the fixed income sector came from long exposure to European bonds in early December.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as OPEC-induced over supply led to further declines in energy prices. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. Energy markets continued the rally which started in late January hurting the Fund's short positioning in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Short Brent crude position was the significant source of profits. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In the energy sector, U.S. dollar weakness and tensions in the Middle East led to a positive environment for energy prices. Higher prices for West Texas Intermediate continued to put pressure on short positions. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Short positioning in energies proved difficult with short natural gas positions causing a drag on performance after prices came off their lows from early in June Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as the Fund saw significant contributions to performance from short positions in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude. Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran resulted in implicit ramifications for oil markets, as traders anticipated an increase in supply if Iran is no longer subjected to an embargo. Profits resulted from this as the Fund was positioned to take advantage of the oil sell-off. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Despite the strong price action, the Fund saw positive returns in a number of energy markets. Specifically, short positions in heating oil, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude were amongst the top performing contracts. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter as West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude traded lower throughout September resulting in positive returns in energies that allowed the commodities complex to contribute positively to performance. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Due to intraday swings West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude were both detractors during October, with natural gas compensating for the losses resulting in a position return for the energy sector during October. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund's short positions in crude and gas-related products traded lower in a straight-forward trend during November. Ongoing oversupply issues have contributed in driving prices of oil and related products lower. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund benefited from short exposure, mainly in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil as these contracts continued to trade lower. While the Trading Program reduced its energy exposure throughout December, it maintained a short bias and continued to benefit from weaker pricing environments.\nThe metals sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The commodities space suffered reversals in most sectors with only metals avoiding losses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Although the metals sector contribution was essentially flat, this sector did produce losses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to gold and silver being down in the face of U.S. dollar weakness. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter due to the Fund's short positioning in metals. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Metals were the lone positive performing sector, with copper and palladium among the top performing markets for the Fund in June. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter due the Fund's short positions in copper. The Fund also took advantage of the often aggressive markdowns seen in gold. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter due to the Fund's short positioning in base metals, which provided small positive returns. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Fund saw slightly negative returns in metals in September, despite general weakness in the space. There was a strong bid mid-month that made it difficult to reap the benefits of lower prices. Platinum contributed positively to performance, but not enough to offset losses from copper, palladium, and gold. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fund started October net short and experiencing a short squeeze mainly prompted by Glencore reducing capacity in some mines and the strong showing from gold and silver at the start of the month, when the U.S. dollar was weak. The metals sector overall flipped from short to long positioning by the end of the month. Short positioning in platinum was the largest detractor in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Base metals posted strong positive performance due to oversupply issues in connection with lower demand from China, especially in copper. Precious metals and silver both traded lower throughout November due to a strong U.S. dollar. A short platinum position benefited from this and was a top contributor for the month. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. In metals, the short delta reduced in the first week of December and remained constant thereafter. A strong bid in the precious metals space was seen early in December, but this faded and gold and silver finished the month largely where they started. Industrial metals traded predominantly sideways during December after a long downward trend seen throughout the year.\nThe stock indices sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter while profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. European equities led the way, especially after a short term solution was found for Greece. However, all regions contributed to performance, with Europe and Asia strongest while U.S. equities made a comeback towards the end of February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter as the Fund suffered modest losses from long positioning in a number of markets including the S&P as well as the FTSE Index. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the Fund maintained long exposure to the equities sector, favoring Asian and U.S. equities over EU equities for the majority of April. This regional diversification benefited performance, and despite an aggressive sell off towards the end of April, equities posted a positive return. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Exposure remained fairly balanced across the three major regions, the United States, Europe and Asia, with U.S. equities posting positive performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. The Fund maintained mixed exposures to equities throughout June but ended June with an overall aggregate short exposure. General weakness throughout June was apparent. The close of June brought about a downturn in European and U.S. equities resulting from concerns over Greece. The Shanghai Composite saw large daily swings in both directions. Short positioning in the VIX was among the worst performing positions in June. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, U.S. dollar strength, political instability and weakness in commodities led to poor performance from emerging market equities. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The equities sector was the largest detractor from performance for August. Equities started August with net long exposure, however transitioned to net short by month-end. Despite a quiet start to August, global equities on aggregate plunged. This negative contribution was mainly due to a short position in the VIX, which was the largest detractor in the Fund for August. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. September was generally a difficult month for short equity positions in all regions due to the short term squeeze that occurred after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Major indices did re-test the August lows towards the end of September, as news flow became very bearish on individual sectors like autos and commodities. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Throughout October equity volatility declined as central bankers talked up their respective stimulus packages which contributed to investors chasing equities higher. Despite the sector exposure flip to long positions losses were incurred on the short side. The largest detractor for the month was the long VIX position. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund made small positive returns in Asian and European equities, but this was overshadowed by losses in the U.S. and volatility futures. Short positioning in the VIX detracted most from performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund approached the European Central Bank meeting in early December with net long equity exposure accumulated during a considerable risk rally in Europe ahead of the meeting. The shedding of risk seen in the market reaction after the European Central Bank did not expand quantitative easing transpired into the Fund cutting the net long exposure and building a net short delta throughout December. The net short exposure peaked mid-month and ended December with modest short exposure. U.S. equities did not fare much better after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates and U.S. equities reacted\nwith volatility and finished the year on the defensive. European sector swaps followed by the VIX were the largest detractors from performance in the equity sector.\nThe currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The currency sector also contributed positively to performance in January, though it contained some of the top and bottom performing individual markets for the Trading Program. The dollar staged a rally, with the Fund benefitting from a short Euro position. The Trading Program had largely removed the Swiss franc from its core strategies avoiding the negative impact from the decision by the Swiss National Bank to remove the currency cap against the Euro. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The currencies sector contributed positively to returns with the U.S. dollar index finishing February higher albeit in a relatively tight range over the month. The Fund generated gains from both a short Japanese yen position as well as a long New Zealand dollar position. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The currency sector was a source of gains for the Fund as the U.S. dollar index continued to rally against a number of currencies, which led to an element of profit taking as March drew to a close. The Fund made positive returns from the currency space despite this profit taking into March month end and, in particular, short exposure to the Euro and Swedish krone were a source of gains. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The currency sector saw negative performance in April. Large volatility due to over positioning in short Euro and long U.S. dollar against many other currencies contributed to negative performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The currency sector contributed positively in May. U.S. dollar strength against other currencies resulted in positive contribution from the sector. The short Japanese yen and Swedish krona forward positions were top contributors for the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Currencies were one of the worst performing sectors in June. For the most part, the U.S. dollar traded sideways throughout June. This was largely due to Euro/U.S. dollar appearing stuck in a small range for much of June despite equities and bonds both moving aggressively on Greek headlines. The short Swedish krona forward position was the largest detractor in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Currencies were one of the top positive contributors throughout July as short Swedish krona, followed by short Canadian dollar positions were the top contributors in the currencies space. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter as slightly larger negative returns seen in developed currencies, specifically short Euro and Swedish krona positions, offset the positive gains and resulted in the sector's negative performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Currencies overall detracted from performance in September. For the most part the U.S. dollar was flat in September, whereas some emerging market currencies saw declines as a result of political turmoil. The U.S. dollar finished September close to where it started, despite a mid-month dip, after the Federal Open Market Committee failed to raise rates which caused some profit-taking by longs. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The long U.S. dollar versus a host of other pairs decreased slightly by the end of October with mixed moves. The U.S. dollar proved a very challenging trade in October with a sharp sell off at the beginning of the month being countered and showing some strength into the end of the month. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. A major theme throughout November was a persistent and strong bid for the U.S. dollar. This fared well for the Fund as the Trading Program has generally been long the U.S. dollar against a variety of currencies. Throughout the month the aggregate exposure of the long U.S. dollar versus a number of currencies increased. The Fund ended November with a solid return which was contributed by both G-10 and emerging markets FX crosses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The currency sector was a detractor to performance in December. The Fund maintained long exposure to the U.S. dollar versus a number of foreign currencies; however, this exposure decreased significantly throughout the month. A large squeeze was seen in Euro/U.S. dollar after the European Central Bank meeting, as investors rushed to take off short exposure to the Euro. Most of the U.S. dollar losses occurred all in one day on this aggressive move, and spent the rest of the month consolidating. Despite a change in monetary policy and the delivery of an anticipated rate rise, the U.S. dollar could only reclaim approximately half of the losses experienced on that day. The majority of the losses in December were from short exposure to Swedish krona and Euro versus U.S. dollar.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter primarily from short exposure to wheat during January. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter because of the Fund's short positioning in crops which was to the detriment of Fund performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The Fund experienced modest losses in crops from a short bias to the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April agriculture was strong with gains in short corn and wheat positions, where both trended lower in the face of good supply and higher yields due to better weather. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as the crops sector was a detractor for May. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Short positioning in crops in the beginning of June largely contributed to the negative performance as adverse weather conditions fuelled a large rally towards the end of June. Short wheat and corn positions were large contributors to the negative performance in the crop sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Crops were a slight detractor on performance, mainly due to long soybean positions that flipped short at the end of July. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter as crops detracted from performance in August mainly due to a short position in soybeans. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Crops detracted from\nperformance, mainly due to short positioning in corn and wheat which experienced large short squeezes. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fund maintained net short positioning in agricultures. Short exposure in crops increased mainly by adding to the short positions in wheat and corn, while reducing longs in soymeal and soybean. Short live cattle was the top detractor in the sector due to the choppy trading environment. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter with crops ending December relatively flat and meats modestly down.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,739,088\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,212,825\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 928,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,517,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,827,961\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,399,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,065,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (530,630\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,534,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Fund experienced a net profit of $10,065,265 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2014. Profits were primarily attributable to the Fund trading in the interest rate, currency and agriculture sectors posting profits. The metal, stock indices and energy sectors posted losses.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The top performing individual markets fell in January within the fixed income sectors. The Fund's strategy entered January with a small net long bias to the sector and added to this over the course of January, benefitting from the flight out of risk assets into the safe haven of fixed income. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The Fund's small net long bias was maintained steadily through February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan all kept key interest rates unchanged. Peripheral yields in Europe continued to fall, and economic data improved modestly, but inflation remained low and medium-term inflation expectations also looked to have drifted lower. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as the short term interest rates sector benefitted from the general strength of fixed income markets. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. In June the short term interest rate sector detracted slightly from performance, however this was more than offset by the positive contribution from the bond sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as yields generally fell in Europe. Performance in the short term interest rate sector was influenced by changes in expectations of future rate changes, and detracted from performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The Fund maintained its long positioning across many fixed income markets during August and benefitted as yields fell (prices rose), particularly in the developed markets where many benchmark yields fell, such as the German 10Y yield and the German 2Y yield. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The Trading Program reduced its long positioning across many fixed income markets during September, but the initial positions led to modest losses at the start of September as yields rose (prices fell), particularly in the U.S. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Positive performance in the fixed income sector was driven by long positioning across both bonds and short interest rates, and resulted in the sector producing each of the top three performing individual markets for the strategy. Positioning benefitted as prices rose in the first half October, and a gradual reduction in exposure then helped protect these gains as bond prices fell during the second half of October. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Long positioning was moderately increased across fixed income markets during November, across both the bonds and short interest rates sectors, which benefitted strongly as yields declined in many markets. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. Long positioning across fixed income markets was maintained during December, across both the bonds and short interest rates sectors. While bonds provided a positive contribution, the performance across individual markets was mixed and the sector contained some of the best and worst performing individual markets, with the Japanese government bonds and Italian BTP amongst the strongest and U.S. Treasuries amongst the weakest.\nThe currency sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as the U.S. dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, rose in January. Looking across individual currency pairs, the Australian dollar and the Euro both weakened versus U.S. dollar while the Japanese yen strengthened. The sector detracted\nfrom performance in January with many moves representing a reversal of recent trends. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as the U.S. dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, fell in February as most developed market currencies, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and the Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. The Fund held a net long bias to the U.S. dollar and although performance varied across currency pairs, the FX sector detracted from performance. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. In currency markets the U.S. dollar was modestly stronger, as the Dollar index increased in March. In developed markets the Euro weakened against the U.S. dollar, as did the British pound. The Japanese yen also weakened while the Australian dollar strengthened. In emerging markets the Brazilian real and Russian ruble both strengthened, respectively. The FX sector was the largest positive contributor to performance, as persistent trends were identified and captured. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to the U.S. dollar being weaker, as several developed market currencies appreciated versus the dollar. In April the currency sector saw mixed returns, with prices of some major markets moving sideways or reversing the existing trends. The more difficult individual markets, detracting from performance, included NZD-USD and USD-JPY which both represented reversals of existing trends. The switch to overall net short positioning in U.S. dollar indicated a flexible response to broader market movements as the U.S. Dollar index (DXY) fell toward the end of April. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. In May the U.S. dollar strengthened. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter due to a strong individual contributor, NZD-USD, which having fallen in May rallied in June. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter due to weakening of several emerging market currencies. The EUR-USD and NZD-USD both experienced declines in July. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The currency sector contributed positively to performance. The U.S. dollar generally strengthened against many major currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar but weakened slightly against the Australian dollar. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The currency sector contributed negatively to performance, as the accelerating movement in U.S. dollar strength led to losses in some currency pairs, including both Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar versus U.S. dollar. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The currencies sector contributed positively to performance overall, through a number of smaller contributions from individual markets. Short positioning in Euro and Japanese yen benefitted from a modest continuation of existing trends in both markets, with actions by the Bank of Japan, causing Japanese yen to notably weaken at the end of October. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The currency sector provided one of the best performing individual markets through short positioning in JPY, which benefitted as the yen continued to weaken in response to actions by the Bank of Japan. Profits were posted to the Fund in the end of the fourth quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen, with the dollar index finishing December at its high for the year, and the Euro continued to weaken, with EUR-USD finishing at its low for the year. The Fund switched its net U.S. dollar bias from a small short to long early in December and consequently benefitted from the moves.\nThe agriculture sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as wheat continued its decline falling during January. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as drought conditions in Brazil helped push the agricultural sector higher, including soybeans which were one of the top performing markets for the strategy. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The crops sector reacted to a bullish report from the U.S.D.A., particularly for soybeans and corn, while risks in Ukraine also impacted wheat, pushing prices higher. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April the agricultural sector was active as prices of the benchmark contracts rose on higher than expected demand figures, adding to gains for corn, wheat and soybeans. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. The crop sector detracted from returns as several markets, such as soybeans, saw sharp price movements. Soybean prices largely held in the same range for most of the second quarter, but then broke lower after data from the USDA showed high levels of planting and stockpiles. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. The crops sector was a positive contributor as, having switched to a short bias, it was correctly positioned to benefit from the continued declines in prices, such as falling corn and wheat prices. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The crops sector contributed strongly as short positioning benefitted from a resumption of the downward trend that had developed in benchmark markets in the summer. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Previously established downward trends in the crops sector generally reversed course during October, and ran counter to the short positioning held by the strategy. This was exemplified by corn, which rose and was one of the bottom returning markets for the strategy during October. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The crops sector detracted from the Fund, as most markets experienced choppy price during November. Losses were posted to the Fund in the end of the fourth quarter as rallies early in December tended to reverse by month end.\nThe metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as gold regained some of its safe haven status, up in January, while industrial metals tended to fall on weaker growth and demand expectations. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. Precious metals continued the trend from January with prices rising, while industrial metals were more subdued and registered small price gains as a group. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Fears of a slowdown in Chinese growth caused a sell-off in the\ncopper market. Gold prices fell in March on reduced demand for the safe haven asset. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April the metals sector was relatively range-bound. Metal prices generally recovered from the losses of March. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as gold was particularly weak as it lost ground in connection with a stronger dollar and rising risk appetites in general. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July the metals sector contributed small positive gains as base metal prices modestly extended recent gains. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The metals sector detracted slightly with varied price movements across markets. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter as the metal complex provided a modest positive contribution to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter as markets experienced large ranges but small net moves in December.\nThe stock indices sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The equity sector detracted from performance as markets retreated. In response to these market moves the Fund cut risk exposure to the sector. While the most significant price moves were seen in the Nikkei, other major indices such as the S&P 500, EuroStoxx and FTSE also experienced falls. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The equity sector provided the largest contribution to performance in February. Long positioning of the Fund's strategy benefitted from the strong equity markets, as investor risk appetite returned and the recent focus on emerging market concerns faded. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter as equity sector returns were mixed and demonstrated few persistent trends. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to price drops in stocks linked to the technology area. Long positioning was maintained in the equity sector during April, though with a reduced delta. Benchmark indices saw diverse returns, with muted performance in the S&P500 and Nasdaq; the Nikkei recorded loss; and the FTSE 100 recorded gain. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. In May the equities sector was a strong contributor to performance, with long positions benefitting from a widespread rally across benchmark contracts. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. In June equity indices around the globe showed diverse performance, for example the S&P 500 and the Nikkei indices rose, while the FTSE and EuroStoxx indices fell. The Fund maintained a long bias to the equity sector through June. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. The Fund saw a small gain coming from the equity sector, where it maintained a long bias through July. The exposure was trimmed towards July month end as many developed market indices lost ground in moves triggered by poor economic data and flaring of geopolitical concerns. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter as a long bias in the equity sector was maintained, and slightly increased through August. This benefitted the Trading Program as many equity markets recovered ground lost in July, and some such as the S&P 500, which broke through the 2000 level, reached new highs; though differentiation was still observed as a number of markets, notably in Asia, did not participate in the broader move. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. A long bias in the equity sector was significantly reduced over September, and implemented broadly across geographies, helping to protect against the price falls that occurred across a number of markets. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. A long bias in the equities sector was quickly reduced during October as a number of global markets initially fell. The strategy briefly reached a small net short positioning in equities, though this was not sustained as equity markets then generally rallied during the second half of October. The equities sector was the largest detractor from returns. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter as the Trading Program increased its long bias in the equities sector during November, adding exposure to a number of markets globally and consequently benefitted from an extension of the rally that had taken hold during the latter half of October, particularly in major developed countries. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. Political events influenced markets during December as Prime Minister Abe's coalition was re-elected in Japan, while deadlock occurred in Greece's presidential election. Economic data were mixed during December; with further improvement in U.S. labor markets highlighted by strong monthly payroll numbers, while growth momentum slowed in the Euro area and fuelled speculation that quantitative easing may still be necessary.\nThe energy sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The energy complex was generally lower in January, with the exception of natural gas where the cold winter weather resulted in higher demand in the U.S. With the Fund's strategy holding net long exposure to the sector, the general price fall in the sector resulted in it detracting from performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. In February, cold weather conditions in the U.S. lifted natural gas and heating oil prices. Crude oil prices resumed an upward move in February after recent price consolidation, with West Texas Intermediate rising. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. An overall long bias was maintained in the energy sector in March, though reduced physical demand for crude oil and a modest sale of stocks by the U.S. limited any price reaction to the geopolitical risks linked to Russia. Natural gas prices fell back in March as forecasts predicted warming weather trends. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April the energy sector was relatively range-bound, while natural gas was lifted by production issues arising in key supply areas. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter due to oil prices moving higher. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter due to a strong contribution in\nperformance from RBOB gasoline. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. This was driven by two of the worst performing individual markets in July: WTI Crude and Gasoline RBOB. The crude oil and distillate markets reversed the previously established positive trend on improved supply estimates, despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions; this prompted a marked reduction in the Trading Program's risk allocated to the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Long positioning in energies, particularly gasoline and crude oil, caused losses as price falls were extended through August on renewed supply availability and fears of economic weakness inducing lower demand. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Mixed results occurred in the energy sector, as individual markets provided both winning and losing positions, to result in a net loss. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The energy sector detracted as large price movements and volatility were seen in many markets. During November crude oil declined, following OPEC's decision to maintain production levels. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter as most energy markets continued to build on the moves witnessed in December, with WTI and Brent crude down.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,487,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (420,315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,334,162\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,175,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,749,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,152,361\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,344,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brokerage Commissions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (815,030\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,159,154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Fund experienced a net loss of $11,344,124 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2013. Profits were primarily attributable to the Fund trading in the stock indices sectors posting profits. The agriculture, currency, energy, interest rate and metal sectors posted losses.\nThe stock indices posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Equity markets around the globe benefitted as the more optimistic mood at the start of the year drove indices to multi-year highs. The Trading Program benefitted from this rally as it maintained, and slightly increased, its net long exposure to the sector. The result was that the equity sector was the largest contributor to the Fund's performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as equity index performance varied markedly around the globe. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The equity sector provided the strongest positive contribution to performance in March as many, but not all, equity indices rallied strongly. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter as the Trading Program held a net long exposure to the equity markets. Equity indices around the globe continued to rally in April including the Nikkei as stimulus plans were announced by the Bank of Japan. The EuroStoxx index was up. In the U.S., where many companies reporting earnings in April exceeded analyst forecasts, the S&P 500 index was up. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as equity indices in the U.S. and Europe continued to rally. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. European and U.S. equity markets reversed their recent price trends in June, with the indices finishing in negative territory despite staging a slight recovery from the intra-month lows as month-end approached. European markets lagged the U.S. The Japanese stock market continued to exhibit significant volatility, but in contrast to European and U.S. stock markets, was only marginally down for June. In aggregate, these moves were against the net long bias that the Trading Program held at the beginning of June resulting in losses posted to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as equity indices around the globe generally responded to the positive sentiment and rallied strongly. In the U.S., the corporate earnings season kicked off and typically exceeded expectations, lifting the S&P 500 index higher. These moves benefitted the Trading Program's long positions in the equity sector, a directional bias that was added to over the course of July and as a result the sector contained the three largest individual contributors to Fund performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Equity markets while initially continuing the rally seen in July, then fell back and finished August in negative territory. The Trading Program held a long bias in the sector at the start of August, and although this was substantially reduced over the month, maintained the long bias at month end. As a result the equity sector was the worst performing sector for the Fund in August. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The equity sector provided the greatest contribution to returns, with the Trading Program benefitting from the net long exposure held at the start of September and as indices rose the strategy added to the exposure before trimming slightly as markets retreated into month-end. At the same time\nvolatility in the equity markets continued to fall, benefitting the Trading Program's short positions held in the VIX index. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Global equity markets tended to rally through October, with the Nikkei being the only major market to underperform. The IBEX 35 index, which rose in October, was one of the largest individual contributors to performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter as global equity markets continued to rally through November. Of the major indices the performance of the Nikkei stood out; having lagged other indices in October. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter as markets initially fell moving against the long bias held by the Fund. The model reacted by reducing the long bias and consequently the exposure in the second half of December, when markets rallied, was lower, and left the sector contribution close to flat by the end of December.\nThe metals sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The metal sector marginally detracted from performance with no significant individual drivers. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as metal markets fell moving against the net long position that the Trading Program held at the start of February. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The metal sector provided a positive contribution to the Trading Program's performance as copper prices continued to fall during March. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter resulting from the Trading Program's net short exposure in gold and copper which fell during April. In May gold prices continued to move lower resulting in losses posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The second quarter ended with profits posted to the Fund. Both precious and base metals slid in June as markets reacted to the U.S Federal Reserve's statements on QE and also to signs that China's growth might be reined in. Copper fell through June in response to uncertainty about Chinese demand. The fall benefitted the Trading Program's short position in the market resulting in profits posted to the Fund. Gold fell towards the end of June. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as the downward price trends in both base and precious metals reversed. Gold recovered from June's lows, up in July, while copper was fairly range-bound finishing up in July. Both of these moves were against the short bias that the Trading Program held in the sector, which consequently detracted from returns. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Gold continued the rally that started in July and copper, which peaked intra-month fell back at the end of August. These price moves were against the Trading Program's short bias that it held at the beginning of August and despite switching to a long bias, the sector still detracted from returns. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Gold prices fell in September despite having surged after the U.S. Federal Reserve did not initiate tapering of its QE program. Having held a long bias in the metal sector at the beginning of September, a position that had reversed by month's end, losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The intra-month volatility was also evident in commodity markets such as gold, where price movements largely reflected changing sentiment with respect to the U.S. debt ceiling discussions and later in October the potential delay in tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program reversed the net direction bias it held in the metal sector in November moving from a small net long to a net short position. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter as gold continued to fall in December.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The agriculture sector marginally detracted from performance with no significant individual drivers. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as crop markets fell moving against the net long position that the Trading Program held at the start of February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Within the commodity markets the crop sector detracted from performance, and contained one of the worst performing individual markets - corn. With prices having risen steadily through March, approaching their year-to- date highs, inventory data released by the USDA indicated that inventories and projected planting were both significantly higher than market expectations. The result was a sharp fall in corn prices on the day the USDA released their data. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. Corn plunged in April as inventory data and planting forecasts exceeded analyst forecasts which contributed to the negative performance from the crop sector. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The Trading Program switched from a net short to net long bias, benefitting from price rises, such as the increase in soybean futures from rising Chinese demand. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter as soybeans, reversed their recent price trends. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. The crop sector detracted marginally from returns as several markets, including soybeans which were down moved against the long bias that the Trading Program held at the start of the July and by the end of the month was net short the crop sector. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. One notable mover was soybeans, which reversed their recent trend lower as hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest threatened to lower yields from the world's biggest grower; soybean futures finished higher at the end of August. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The crop sector also posted a negative performance contribution. The Trading Program's short position in corn benefitted as prices dropped due to fall in demand. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to losses from crops. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter as the price of corn continued to fall in November. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The agricultural sector was a positive contributor to performance in December\nand contained one of the top performing markets, wheat. Wheat prices fell in December as forecasts showed reduced risk of frost damage to crops in the U.S.\nThe currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. In the FX markets, the broader Dollar Index initially rose before falling to finish down at the end of January. The moves in individual currencies were, in some cases, more extreme and in aggregate the FX sector delivered a strong positive contribution. The continued weakening of the Japanese yen saw U.S. dollar-Japanese yen rise, reaching levels not seen since mid-2010; this move benefitted the Trading Program's short Japanese yen position. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. In FX markets, the broad Dollar Index rallied strongly, having generally trended downward over the previous two and a half months. The strong moves in individual currency pairs resulted in the sector containing two of the worst performing markets and combined to leave the FX sector as the second highest detractor. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In FX markets, the broad Dollar Index continued to fall in April. The Japanese yen continued to weaken and the Euro reversed recent moves and strengthened. In combination, moves in the FX markets resulted in the sector delivering a small negative performance contribution. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. In FX markets, the broad Dollar Index reversed recent moves and rose in May. The Japanese yen continued to weaken however, the intra-month move was more substantial having weakened mid-month before recovering slightly. In combination, moves in the FX markets resulted in the sector delivering a negative performance contribution. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Aggregate moves in the currency space resulted in a negative contribution from the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. The U.S. dollar, as represented by the Dollar Index, initially rallied before falling back and finishing down in July. In combination, moves in the currency markets resulted in the FX sector delivering a negative performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Movements in currency markets, where the Dollar Index rose in August having been fairly range bound, resulted in a series of small gains and losses across the set of markets traded; the cumulative result being flat performance for the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter as the Dollar Index fell reversing the positive trend that had appeared in the second half of August. With mixed performance between markets, for example U.S. dollar-Japanese yen up and Euro-British pound up the sector detracted from the Fund performance in September. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. the Dollar Index finished the month almost unchanged, but moved intra- month; this fluctuation, coupled with mixed performance across other individual markets, caused the sector to detract from the Fund's performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The FX sector contained both one of the largest individual contributors and one of the largest detractors from the Fund's performance. The Trading Program's short bias to the Japanese yen proved profitable as it weakened against the U.S. dollar; however the long bias to the Australian dollar detracted from performance as it weakened against the U.S. dollar. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter as the U.S. dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, fell in December.\nThe energy sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Energy markets, in general, rallied strongly in January which benefitted the Trading Program's long positions; RBOB Gasoline, which rose in price in January, was one of the top individual contributors to the Trading Program's performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The worst performing sector in February was the energy sector. In general these markets continued their upward trend through the first half of February before reversing and then finishing the month significantly lower (for example, Brent Crude rallied before reversing and finishing the month down). The sharp price falls followed the latest inventory data released by the American Petroleum Institute (API) which indicated that U.S. crude stock piles had risen to their highest level since December. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The unusually cold start to spring in the U.S. led to a surge in the price of natural gas, while optimism on the economic recovery in the U.S. were in part responsible for the rise in WTI crude futures. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter resulting from the Trading Program's net long exposure in the energy complex. U.S. crude oil inventories climbed and the International Energy Agency trimmed its forecast for global demand, WTI crude futures fell over the first half of April before recovering slightly into month end. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Despite the initial rallies of several markets, most markets proceeded to fall and ended down in May which went against the Trading Program's net long position in the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. WTI crude prices rose as investors reacted to the worsening unrest in Syria and a shrinking of U.S. stockpiles. Elsewhere, natural gas prices fell as mild weather shrank demand and saw inventories rise. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Most energy markets rallied in July with WTI crude up during the month following successive weekly drops in U.S. inventories. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The energy complex generally saw prices rise over the course of August in response to growing tensions involving Syria. These price rises benefitted the Trading Program's long positions in the energy sector, and saw risk being added during August. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. As tensions involving Syria eased prices in the energy complex fell from their recent highs, for example Brent Crude fell in September. Gasoline futures slid as inventories were expected to rise. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter as energy prices displayed a reasonable level of\nprice volatility, however most fell over the month; West Texas Intermediate saw prices react to changing inventory data, initially rallying as stockpiles fell before prices falling as data mid-month showed a strong rise in inventories. In October, Natural Gas prices initially rose before finishing down while West Texas Intermediate prices rallied before falling to finish down in October. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter as a as a number of markets experienced sharp reversals of their recent trend; one of the largest individual detractors was natural gas, which having initially continued to cheapen, finished the month of November sharply higher. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. Shrinking stockpiles and the plan to start part of the Keystone XL pipeline in January saw West Texas Intermediate Crude prices peak intra-month before they settled back to finish up. As a result of prices retreating in the final few trading days of the year, and the net long positioning of the Fund, the sector detracted from returns.\nThe interest rate sector posted losses to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. A consequence of the risk-on rally that benefitted the equity sector in January was that fixed income markets retreated, with both bond futures and short term interest rate futures falling. This price movement was against the long positions held by the Trading Program and resulted in the fixed income sectors being the largest detractors from performance; these sectors also contained the three worst performing markets over the period as well. In response to these falls in price, the Trading Program substantially reduced position sizes within both the bond and short term interest rate sectors. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. In response to the weaker European data and concerns over the economic environment in both Europe and the U.S., global fixed income markets tended to reflect lower interest rates in February. This benefitted the Trading Program's net long positions in both bond and short term interest rate futures. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter as the Trading Program maintained its net long positions in both the bond and short term interest rate futures. European and UK 10 year bond futures rose, while the moves in the U.S. and Japanese 10 year bond futures were slightly more muted. Price movements in the short term interest rate sector were less consistent and led to the sector detracting slightly from performance. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The size of the moves in U.S. fixed income drove three of the markets across maturities to be the largest individual positive contributors to Fund performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. In light of the significant moves witnessed in global fixed income markets, reversing many trends that had persisted for extended periods of time, the largest detractors from Fund performance were the fixed income sectors (both bonds and short term interest rates). Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. In response to the falls in fixed income markets in June caused by extensive deleveraging of market participants following comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke on potential reduction in quantitative easing, the Trading Program continued to reduce long positions before starting to initiate a net short bias across the sector. The speed and magnitude of the market moves was such that the Trading Program had insufficient time to reposition before experiencing losses, and as a result both bonds and short term interest rates detracted from Fund performance in June. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Market movements within the fixed income sectors varied as the U.S. bond futures ended July down, however European bund futures were up intra-month and ended up as a detracting market. The fixed income sectors, bonds and short term interest rates, contributed negatively to performance in aggregate. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Fixed income markets, both short term interest rates and bonds, benefitted as yields rose in general. However, performance across the various markets and regions varied and the sector contained both one of the top contributing markets (Brazilian IRS) and one of the largest detractors Australian 3 year bonds. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Fixed income futures, both bonds and short term interest rates, rose over the course of September. As a result, the Trading Program moved from holding a slight short bias to a slight long bias in the sectors, and was able to benefit from these moves. The Japanese Government Bond (\u201cJGB\u201d) futures, which rose during September was one of the largest individual contributors to Fund returns. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter with bond prices around the globe generally rising, the fixed income sectors, both bonds and short term interest rates, contributed positively to performance. The Trading Program added to its net long exposure over the course of October. However, movements were not uniform across the markets covered by the strategy, and the bond sector contained both one of the greatest individual contributors and one of the largest detractors from performance in October. The JGB position, in which the Trading Program was net long, benefitted as the futures rose, while the Australian 3 year bond finished down and detracted from performance. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter with the bond sector ending up as the largest detractor for November while the short term interest rate sector contributed positively to returns. In the U.S. and UK yields rose in response to increased optimism for the economic outlook, while in other regions such as Japan and Germany yields were almost unchanged in November. At the front end of the yield curve, the long bias that the Trading Program held in short term interest rate futures benefitted as both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continued to stress that interest rates would not rise for some time yet. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. With yields rising in most markets the moves were against the Trading Program's long bias held in the sector, which resulted in the strategy reducing its net exposure.\nVariables Affecting Performance\nThe principal variables that determine the net performance of the Fund are gross profitability from the Fund's trading activities and interest income.\nThe Fund currently earns interest based on the prevailing Fed Funds rate plus a spread for short cash positions and minus a spread for long cash positions. The current short term interest rates have remained extremely low when compared with historical rates and thus has contributed negligible amounts to overall Fund performance.\nDuring all periods set forth above in \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d, the interest rates in many countries were at unusually low levels. In addition, low interest rates are frequently associated with reduced fixed income market volatility, and in static markets the Fund's profit potential generally tends to be diminished. On the other hand, during periods of higher interest rates, the relative attractiveness of a high risk investment such as the Fund may be reduced as compared to high yielding and much lower risk fixed-income investments.\nThe Fund's management fees and Sponsor fees are a constant percentage of Fund's assets. Brokerage commissions, which are not based on a percentage of the Fund's assets, are based on actual round turns. The performance fees payable to the Trading Advisor are based on increase in the aggregate Net Asset Value of Classes of Units subject to the same rate of performance fees in excess of the High Water Mark, excluding interest and prior to reduction for Sponsor fees.\nUnlike many investment fields, there is no meaningful distinction in the operation of the Fund between realized and unrealized profits. Most of the contracts traded by the Fund are highly liquid and can be closed out at any time.\nExcept in unusual circumstances, factors-regulatory approvals, cost of goods sold, employee relations and the like-which often materially affect an operating business, have no material impact on the Fund.\nLiquidity; Capital Resources\nThe Fund borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the Fund's U.S. dollar deposits. These borrowings are at a prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency.\nSubstantially all of the Fund's assets are held in cash with the brokers. Changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down price trends, during which the Fund's profit or loss potential might increase. Inflation in commodity prices could also generate price movements, which the strategies might successfully follow. The Fund should be able to close out its open trading positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at market prices, except in unusual circumstances. This typically permits the Fund to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing so.\nAs a commodity pool, the Fund maintains an extremely large percentage of its assets in cash, which it must have available to post initial and variation margin on futures contracts. This cash is also used to fund redemptions. While the Fund has the ability to fund redemption proceeds from liquidating positions, as a practical matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions. In the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions, MLAI, as the Manager of the Fund, has the ability to override decisions of the Trading Advisor to fund redemptions if necessary, but in practice the Trading Advisor would determine in its discretion which investments should be liquidated.\nThe Fund has no applicable off-balance sheet arrangements or tabular disclosure of contractual obligations of the type described in Items 303(a)(4) and 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRecent accounting developments, if any, are discussed in the notes to the financial statements, which are included in Exhibit 13.01.", "summary": "The report provides the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a trading fund.

In addition, the general causes to which certain price movements are attributed may or may not have caused such movements, but simply occurred at or about the same time.\n\nThe Fund experienced a net trading profit of $6,501,808 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Fund's profits were primarily attributable to interest rates, energy, metals, and stock indices sectors. The currency and agriculture sectors posted losses.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Price action resulted from monetary policy actions by major central banks that led to a strong rally in bonds. The bond sector contained the majority of the best performing individual markets, with the U.S. 5 year note posting the strongest gains. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. February was difficult for fixed income, which experienced weak performance at the start of the month. However, after the Greek crisis found some resolution, European bonds traded lower in yield terms, particularly the German Bund and Italian BTPs. Elsewhere the U.S. and UK saw weakness in fixed income throughout February with yields rallying back to where they were at the start of the year. After the strong gains in fixed income in January, the Trading Program suffered a small relative loss on its fixed income positioning in\nFebruary. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. It was a tough start to March for fixed income which saw yields initially go higher. However with the European Central Bank ratcheting up bond purchases and a commitment to buying bonds even with negative yields, European bonds traded lower. In the U.S., treasuries found a buyer in the medium to long term part of the curve. Accordingly, the Fund benefited from its continued long bias to the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the fixed income sector saw a positive start as yields fell in major developed bond markets. However, a reversal towards the end of April erased performance, with yields in Germany rallying off the lows to end April. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Losses were led by the bond sector as bond markets experienced volatility and price declines. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Long positioning across fixed income markets continued through June. German bonds continued to sell off in June. Investor concerns over liquidity and inventory levels played out in volatile short term moves. Long positioning in the Japanese 10 YR accounted for the biggest losses in the bond sector. Eurodollar was the largest detractor in the rates sector with varied exposure throughout June, ending June with long exposure. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, the Fund benefited from a long bias in bonds as bonds rallied towards the end of July. The largest positive contributor in the sector was the long EURO-BTP, with positive contributions from significant long positions in the U.S. 5 year and Japan 10 year bonds. The risk steadily increased throughout July. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The Fund managed a positive return from fixed income in August, with the Eurodollar and the U.K. gilts amongst the best performers. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Short term interest rates were mainly seen in the Eurodollar and Brazilian contracts where both had large moves and resulted in strong positive performance. The Eurodollar moved higher after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and continued to trend higher in September. Brazilian short term rates moved aggressively higher as the currency sold off to lows versus the U.S. dollar. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The market was in a general slump starting October ensuing from the Federal Reserve not raising rates in September. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund continued with its net long bond (short yields) positioning throughout November. The start of the month saw a strong rally in yields, however, this was short lived and the rest of the month saw a reverting move back in yields. This was especially apparent in Europe with German and Italian government bonds reverting to the lows of the year (in yield terms). The U.S. 10 year bond was slower to return to lower yield levels and closed November slightly higher. European bonds rallied and U.S. and Asian bonds ended the month in negative performance territory causing the fixed income space to post a negative return for the month. Long positioning in the EURO-BTP was the largest contributor. The Australian 10 year bond started the month with long exposure where it negatively contributed to performance, ending the month as the top detractor in the sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund continued with its long bonds (short yields) delta throughout December. The majority of the losses in the fixed income sector came from long exposure to European bonds in early December.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as OPEC-induced over supply led to further declines in energy prices. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. Energy markets continued the rally which started in late January hurting the Fund's short positioning in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Short Brent crude position was the significant source of profits. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In the energy sector, U.S. dollar weakness and tensions in the Middle East led to a positive environment for energy prices. Higher prices for West Texas Intermediate continued to put pressure on short positions. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Short positioning in energies proved difficult with short natural gas positions causing a drag on performance after prices came off their lows from early in June Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as the Fund saw significant contributions to performance from short positions in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude. Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran resulted in implicit ramifications for oil markets, as traders anticipated an increase in supply if Iran is no longer subjected to an embargo. Profits resulted from this as the Fund was positioned to take advantage of the oil sell-off. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. Despite the strong price action, the Fund saw positive returns in a number of energy markets. Specifically, short positions in heating oil, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude were amongst the top performing contracts. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter as West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude traded lower throughout September resulting in positive returns in energies that allowed the commodities complex to contribute positively to performance. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Due to intraday swings West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude were both detractors during October, with natural gas compensating for the losses resulting in a position return for the energy sector during October. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund's short positions in crude and gas-related products traded lower in a straight-forward trend during November. Ongoing oversupply issues have contributed in driving prices of oil and related products lower. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund benefited from short exposure, mainly in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil as these contracts continued to trade lower. While the Trading Program reduced its energy exposure throughout December, it maintained a short bias and continued to benefit from weaker pricing environments.\nThe metals sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The commodities space suffered reversals in most sectors with only metals avoiding losses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Although the metals sector contribution was essentially flat, this sector did produce losses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter due to gold and silver being down in the face of U.S. dollar weakness. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter due to the Fund's short positioning in metals. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Metals were the lone positive performing sector, with copper and palladium among the top performing markets for the Fund in June. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter due the Fund's short positions in copper. The Fund also took advantage of the often aggressive markdowns seen in gold. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter due to the Fund's short positioning in base metals, which provided small positive returns. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the quarter. The Fund saw slightly negative returns in metals in September, despite general weakness in the space. There was a strong bid mid-month that made it difficult to reap the benefits of lower prices. Platinum contributed positively to performance, but not enough to offset losses from copper, palladium, and gold. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fund started October net short and experiencing a short squeeze mainly prompted by Glencore reducing capacity in some mines and the strong showing from gold and silver at the start of the month, when the U.S. dollar was weak. The metals sector overall flipped from short to long positioning by the end of the month. Short positioning in platinum was the largest detractor in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Base metals posted strong positive performance due to oversupply issues in connection with lower demand from China, especially in copper. Precious metals and silver both traded lower throughout November due to a strong U.S. dollar. A short platinum position benefited from this and was a top contributor for the month. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. In metals, the short delta reduced in the first week of December and remained constant thereafter. A strong bid in the precious metals space was seen early in December, but this faded and gold and silver finished the month largely where they started. Industrial metals traded predominantly sideways during December after a long downward trend seen throughout the year.\nThe stock indices sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter while profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. European equities led the way, especially after a short term solution was found for Greece. However, all regions contributed to performance, with Europe and Asia strongest while U.S. equities made a comeback towards the end of February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter as the Fund suffered modest losses from long positioning in a number of markets including the S&P as well as the FTSE Index. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the Fund maintained long exposure to the equities sector, favoring Asian and U.S. equities over EU equities for the majority of April. This regional diversification benefited performance, and despite an aggressive sell off towards the end of April, equities posted a positive return. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. Exposure remained fairly balanced across the three major regions, the United States, Europe and Asia, with U.S. equities posting positive performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. The Fund maintained mixed exposures to equities throughout June but ended June with an overall aggregate short exposure. General weakness throughout June was apparent. The close of June brought about a downturn in European and U.S. equities resulting from concerns over Greece. The Shanghai Composite saw large daily swings in both directions. Short positioning in the VIX was among the worst performing positions in June. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, U.S. dollar strength, political instability and weakness in commodities led to poor performance from emerging market equities. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The equities sector was the largest detractor from performance for August. Equities started August with net long exposure, however transitioned to net short by month-end. Despite a quiet start to August, global equities on aggregate plunged. This negative contribution was mainly due to a short position in the VIX, which was the largest detractor in the Fund for August. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. September was generally a difficult month for short equity positions in all regions due to the short term squeeze that occurred after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Major indices did re-test the August lows towards the end of September, as news flow became very bearish on individual sectors like autos and commodities. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Throughout October equity volatility declined as central bankers talked up their respective stimulus packages which contributed to investors chasing equities higher. Despite the sector exposure flip to long positions losses were incurred on the short side. The largest detractor for the month was the long VIX position. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. The Fund made small positive returns in Asian and European equities, but this was overshadowed by losses in the U.S. and volatility futures. Short positioning in the VIX detracted most from performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The Fund approached the European Central Bank meeting in early December with net long equity exposure accumulated during a considerable risk rally in Europe ahead of the meeting. The shedding of risk seen in the market reaction after the European Central Bank did not expand quantitative easing transpired into the Fund cutting the net long exposure and building a net short delta throughout December. The net short exposure peaked mid-month and ended December with modest short exposure. U.S. equities did not fare much better after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates and U.S. equities reacted\nwith volatility and finished the year on the defensive. European sector swaps followed by the VIX were the largest detractors from performance in the equity sector.\nThe currency sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The currency sector also contributed positively to performance in January, though it contained some of the top and bottom performing individual markets for the Trading Program. The dollar staged a rally, with the Fund benefitting from a short Euro position. The Trading Program had largely removed the Swiss franc from its core strategies avoiding the negative impact from the decision by the Swiss National Bank to remove the currency cap against the Euro. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The currencies sector contributed positively to returns with the U.S. dollar index finishing February higher albeit in a relatively tight range over the month. The Fund generated gains from both a short Japanese yen position as well as a long New Zealand dollar position. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The currency sector was a source of gains for the Fund as the U.S. dollar index continued to rally against a number of currencies, which led to an element of profit taking as March drew to a close. The Fund made positive returns from the currency space despite this profit taking into March month end and, in particular, short exposure to the Euro and Swedish krone were a source of gains. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. The currency sector saw negative performance in April. Large volatility due to over positioning in short Euro and long U.S. dollar against many other currencies contributed to negative performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter. The currency sector contributed positively in May. U.S. dollar strength against other currencies resulted in positive contribution from the sector. The short Japanese yen and Swedish krona forward positions were top contributors for the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Currencies were one of the worst performing sectors in June. For the most part, the U.S. dollar traded sideways throughout June. This was largely due to Euro/U.S. dollar appearing stuck in a small range for much of June despite equities and bonds both moving aggressively on Greek headlines. The short Swedish krona forward position was the largest detractor in the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Currencies were one of the top positive contributors throughout July as short Swedish krona, followed by short Canadian dollar positions were the top contributors in the currencies space. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter as slightly larger negative returns seen in developed currencies, specifically short Euro and Swedish krona positions, offset the positive gains and resulted in the sector's negative performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Currencies overall detracted from performance in September. For the most part the U.S. dollar was flat in September, whereas some emerging market currencies saw declines as a result of political turmoil. The U.S. dollar finished September close to where it started, despite a mid-month dip, after the Federal Open Market Committee failed to raise rates which caused some profit-taking by longs. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The long U.S. dollar versus a host of other pairs decreased slightly by the end of October with mixed moves. The U.S. dollar proved a very challenging trade in October with a sharp sell off at the beginning of the month being countered and showing some strength into the end of the month. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the quarter. A major theme throughout November was a persistent and strong bid for the U.S. dollar. This fared well for the Fund as the Trading Program has generally been long the U.S. dollar against a variety of currencies. Throughout the month the aggregate exposure of the long U.S. dollar versus a number of currencies increased. The Fund ended November with a solid return which was contributed by both G-10 and emerging markets FX crosses. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. The currency sector was a detractor to performance in December. The Fund maintained long exposure to the U.S. dollar versus a number of foreign currencies; however, this exposure decreased significantly throughout the month. A large squeeze was seen in Euro/U.S. dollar after the European Central Bank meeting, as investors rushed to take off short exposure to the Euro. Most of the U.S. dollar losses occurred all in one day on this aggressive move, and spent the rest of the month consolidating. Despite a change in monetary policy and the delivery of an anticipated rate rise, the U.S. dollar could only reclaim approximately half of the losses experienced on that day. The majority of the losses in December were from short exposure to Swedish krona and Euro versus U.S. dollar.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter primarily from short exposure to wheat during January. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter because of the Fund's short positioning in crops which was to the detriment of Fund performance. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. The Fund experienced modest losses in crops from a short bias to the sector. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April agriculture was strong with gains in short corn and wheat positions, where both trended lower in the face of good supply and higher yields due to better weather. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as the crops sector was a detractor for May. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. Short positioning in crops in the beginning of June largely contributed to the negative performance as adverse weather conditions fuelled a large rally towards the end of June. Short wheat and corn positions were large contributors to the negative performance in the crop sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter. Crops were a slight detractor on performance, mainly due to long soybean positions that flipped short at the end of July. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter as crops detracted from performance in August mainly due to a short position in soybeans. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. Crops detracted from\nperformance, mainly due to short positioning in corn and wheat which experienced large short squeezes. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Fund maintained net short positioning in agricultures. Short exposure in crops increased mainly by adding to the short positions in wheat and corn, while reducing longs in soymeal and soybean. Short live cattle was the top detractor in the sector due to the choppy trading environment. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter with crops ending December relatively flat and meats modestly down.\n\nThe Fund experienced a net profit of $10,065,265 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2014. Profits were primarily attributable to the Fund trading in the interest rate, currency and agriculture sectors posting profits. The metal, stock indices and energy sectors posted losses.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Fund. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter. The top performing individual markets fell in January within the fixed income sectors. The Fund's strategy entered January with a small net long bias to the sector and added to this over the course of January, benefitting from the flight out of risk assets into the safe haven of fixed income. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter. The Fund's small net long bias was maintained steadily through February. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the second quarter. In April the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan all kept key interest rates unchanged. Peripheral yields in Europe continued to fall, and economic data improved modestly, but inflation remained low and medium-term inflation expectations also looked to have drifted lower. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the second quarter as the short term interest rates sector benefitted from the general strength of fixed income markets. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the second quarter. In June the short term interest rate sector detracted slightly from performance, however this was more than offset by the positive contribution from the bond sector. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the third quarter as yields generally fell in Europe. Performance in the short term interest rate sector was influenced by changes in expectations of future rate changes, and detracted from performance. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the third quarter. The Fund maintained its long positioning across many fixed income markets during August and benefitted as yields fell (prices rose), particularly in the developed markets where many benchmark yields fell, such as the German 10Y yield and the German 2Y yield. Losses were posted to the Fund at the end of the third quarter. The Trading Program reduced its long positioning across many fixed income markets during September, but the initial positions led to modest losses at the start of September as yields rose (prices fell), particularly in the U.S. Profits were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Positive performance in the fixed income sector was driven by long positioning across both bonds and short interest rates, and resulted in the sector producing each of the top three performing individual markets for the strategy. Positioning benefitted as prices rose in the first half October, and a gradual reduction in exposure then helped protect these gains as bond prices fell during the second half of October. Profits were posted to the Fund in the middle of the fourth quarter. Long positioning was moderately increased across fixed income markets during November, across both the bonds and short interest rates sectors, which benefitted strongly as yields declined in many markets. Profits were posted to the Fund at the end of the fourth quarter. Long positioning across fixed income markets was maintained during December, across both the bonds and short interest rates sectors. While bonds provided a positive contribution, the performance across individual markets was mixed and the sector contained some of the best and worst performing individual markets, with the Japanese government bonds and Italian BTP amongst the strongest and U.S. Treasuries amongst the weakest.\nThe currency sector posted profits to the Fund. Losses were posted to the Fund at the beginning of the first quarter as the U.S. dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, rose in January. Looking across individual currency pairs, the Australian dollar and the Euro both weakened versus U.S. dollar while the Japanese yen strengthened. The sector detracted\nfrom performance in January with many moves representing a reversal of recent trends. Losses were posted to the Fund in the middle of the first quarter as the U.S. dollar, as measured by the Dollar Index, fell in February as most developed market currencies, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and the Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. The Fund held a net long bias to the U.S. dollar and although performance varied across currency pairs, the FX sector detracted from performance.
