This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. We were formed in August 2017 and commenced operations on October 2, 2017.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower's other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $25.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2018, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was approved by our board of directors in August 2017 for a two-year term commencing September 29, 2017, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,051,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,442,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,082,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,658,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is\nsupported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018, one stop loans included $27,714,298 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had debt and equity investments in 54 portfolio companies. The weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized income yield(1)\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized investment income yield(2)\n</td> <td>9.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on average net asset value(3)\n</td> <td>11.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on net asset value per share(4)\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets.

For the year ended September 30, 2018, GBDC 3 has earned a year-to-date IRR of 11.8% for stockholders taken as a whole. An individual stockholder's IRR may vary based on the timing of their capital transactions. The IRR is the annualized effective compound rate of return that brings a series of cash flows to the current value of the cash invested. The IRR was computed based on the actual dates of cash inflows (share issuances, including share issuances through the DRIP), outflows (capital distributions), the stockholders' net asset value, or NAV, at the end of the period and distributions declared and payable at the end of the period (residual value of the stockholders' NAV and distributions payable as of each measurement date).\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $700,000;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses may include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies that may be commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with individual or group stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>proxy voting expenses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nRecent Developments\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through December 7, 2018, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2018 are as follows:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,549,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from accretion of discounts and origination fees\n</td> <td>317,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee income\n</td> <td>131,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>4,999,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expenses\n</td> <td>2,512,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income - before excise tax\n</td> <td>2,486,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excise tax\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income - after excise tax\n</td> <td>2,485,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>1,581,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,067,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average earning portfolio company investments, at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,537,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we commenced operations on October 2, 2017, no income was earned during the periods prior to September 30, 2017.\nInvestment Income\nThe income yield by debt security type for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>6.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>9.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt (1)\n</td> <td>8.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents one portfolio company investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For additional details on investment yields and asset mix, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\u201d section below.\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>94,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fee, net of waiver\n</td> <td>512,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income incentive fee, net of waiver\n</td> <td>364,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital gain incentive fee accrued under GAAP, net of waiver\n</td> <td>163,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees, net of waiver\n</td> <td>578,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative service fee\n</td> <td>87,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>44,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expenses - before excise tax\n</td> <td>2,512,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excise tax\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expenses - after excise tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,513,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,946,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we commenced operations on October 2, 2017, no expenses were incurred during the periods prior to September 30, 2017.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the year ended September 30, 2018:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized appreciation on investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,609,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>(27,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,581,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring year ended September 30, 2018, we had $1,609,898 in unrealized appreciation on 44 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $27,919 in unrealized depreciation on 17 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value of portfolio company investments during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $3,642,969. During the period we used $138,976,149 in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $150,024,831. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was $142,619,118, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $214,450,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of $85,912,100 that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $155,950,000.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,653,469. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investor capital subscriptions totaling $470,440,500 of which $85,922,600 had been called and contributed, leaving $384,517,900 of uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the SMBC Revolver, allowed us to borrow up to $110,000,000 at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $58,500,000 outstanding under the SMBC Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had $51,500,000 of remaining commitments and $51,500,000 of availability under the SMBC Revolver.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we were permitted to borrow up to $40,000,000 at any one time outstanding, under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolver.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements, obtains certain approvals and, in the case of unlisted business development companies, makes an offer to repurchase the shares of its stockholders. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder\napproval. We are still evaluating the merits of operating with a higher leverage ratio, and have not sought or obtained either approval and, as a result, remain subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement under Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 248.8%.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $51,432,478. This amount may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2018, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments and cash balances that we maintain, availability under our SMBC Revolver and Revolver, ongoing principal repayments on debt investments assets and uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through net proceeds from capital calls on existing and future investor capital subscriptions and through our dividend reinvestment plan as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing in capital generated by repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investments in 54 portfolio companies with a total fair value $143,658,485.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the year ended September 30, 2018:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>New Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCommitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,401,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>182,661,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>1,957,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total new investment commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,102,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the principal, amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2018(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,102,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,804,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,051,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual(2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing\n</td> <td>123,084,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,232,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,442,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual(2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual(2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,957,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,082,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,268,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,076,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,658,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Six of our loans included a feature permitting a portion of the interest due on such loan to be PIK interest as of September 30, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>We refer to a loan as non-accrual when we cease recognizing interest income on the loan because we have stopped pursuing repayment of the loan or, in certain circumstances, it is past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or our management has reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected.

These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $51,432,478.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, GC Advisors provides us with investment advisory and management services.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above is terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nDistributions\nWe intend to make periodic distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional information on distributions, see Critical Accounting Policies - Income Taxes.\u201d\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather\nthan our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions.

For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly-traded business development company (Nasdaq: GBDC), and Golub Capital Investment Corporation, an unlisted business development company, both of which focus on investing primarily in one stop and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacities for Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Golub Capital Investment Corporation. GC Advisors and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of these other accounts. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors' allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors' allocation procedures.\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nValuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimus threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with each sale of shares of our common stock, we make a determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of common stock at the time at which the sale is made or otherwise in violation of the 1940 Act. GC Advisors will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report filed with the SEC;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Its assessment of whether any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of portfolio securities) during the period beginning\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\non the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share of our common stock and ending two days prior to the date of the sale; and\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The magnitude of the difference between the sale price of the shares of common stock and management's assessment of any change in the net asset value per share of our common stock during the period discussed above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets' or liabilities' complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset's or a liability's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2018. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. As of September 30, 2018, with the exception of money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments), all investments were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. A portfolio company's EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair value of our debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and, in our management's judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2018, we had no portfolio company investments on non-accrual status.\nIncome taxes: We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the year ended September 30, 2018, $853 was incurred for U.S. federal excise tax.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.", "summary": "The MD&A section of the report discusses various aspects of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations.

This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. We were formed in August 2017 and commenced operations on October 2, 2017.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower's other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $25.0 billion in capital under management as of September 30, 2018, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was approved by our board of directors in August 2017 for a two-year term commencing September 29, 2017, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\n\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is\nsupported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018, one stop loans included $27,714,298 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had debt and equity investments in 54 portfolio companies. The weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\n\n \n (1) Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \n (2) Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \n (3) Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load. \n (4) Total return based on net asset value assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.  As of September 30, 2018, GBDC 3 has earned an inception-to-date internal rate of return, or IRR, of 11.8% for stockholders taken as a whole. For the year ended September 30, 2018, GBDC 3 has earned a year-to-date IRR of 11.8% for stockholders taken as a whole. An individual stockholder's IRR may vary based on the timing of their capital transactions. The IRR is the annualized effective compound rate of return that brings a series of cash flows to the current value of the cash invested. The IRR was computed based on the actual dates of cash inflows (share issuances, including share issuances through the DRIP), outflows (capital distributions), the stockholders' net asset value, or NAV, at the end of the period and distributions declared and payable at the end of the period (residual value of the stockholders' NAV and distributions payable as of each measurement date).\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n \u2022 reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $700,000; \n \u2022 calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \n \u2022 fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses may include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies that may be commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses; \n \u2022 expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors; \n \u2022 transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees; \n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; \n \u2022 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; \n \u2022 costs associated with individual or group stockholders; \n \u2022 costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; \n \u2022 proxy voting expenses; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. \nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nRecent Developments\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through December 7, 2018, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. There are no subsequent events to disclose except for the following:\nOn August 7, 2018 and November 27, 2018, our board of directors declared distributions to holders of record as set forth in the table below:\n\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into subscription agreements with additional stockholders totaling $23,825,000 in the aggregate, including an additional subscription agreement entered into by GCOP LLC, an affiliate of GC Advisors, for $10,000,000.\nOn November 27, 2018, we issued 49,178.285 shares of common stock through the DRIP.\nWe issued capital calls to stockholders, which are summarized in the following table:\n\n(1) Capital call was issued on December 6, 2018 and is due on December 17, 2018.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market. We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2018 are as follows:\n\nAs we commenced operations on October 2, 2017, no income was earned during the periods prior to September 30, 2017.\nInvestment Income\nThe income yield by debt security type for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\n\n \n (1) Represents one portfolio company investment.  For additional details on investment yields and asset mix, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\u201d section below.\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018:\n\nAs we commenced operations on October 2, 2017, no expenses were incurred during the periods prior to September 30, 2017.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the year ended September 30, 2018:\n\nDuring year ended September 30, 2018, we had $1,609,898 in unrealized appreciation on 44 portfolio company investments, which was partially offset by $27,919 in unrealized depreciation on 17 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value of portfolio company investments during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $3,642,969. During the period we used $138,976,149 in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $150,024,831. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was $142,619,118, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $214,450,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of $85,912,100 that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $155,950,000.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,653,469. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investor capital subscriptions totaling $470,440,500 of which $85,922,600 had been called and contributed, leaving $384,517,900 of uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the SMBC Revolver, allowed us to borrow up to $110,000,000 at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $58,500,000 outstanding under the SMBC Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had $51,500,000 of remaining commitments and $51,500,000 of availability under the SMBC Revolver.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we were permitted to borrow up to $40,000,000 at any one time outstanding, under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolver.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements, obtains certain approvals and, in the case of unlisted business development companies, makes an offer to repurchase the shares of its stockholders. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder\napproval. We are still evaluating the merits of operating with a higher leverage ratio, and have not sought or obtained either approval and, as a result, remain subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement under Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 248.8%.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $51,432,478. This amount may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2018, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments and cash balances that we maintain, availability under our SMBC Revolver and Revolver, ongoing principal repayments on debt investments assets and uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through net proceeds from capital calls on existing and future investor capital subscriptions and through our dividend reinvestment plan as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing in capital generated by repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investments in 54 portfolio companies with a total fair value $143,658,485.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the year ended September 30, 2018:\n\nThe following table shows the principal, amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by an administrator, or the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We may also selectively invest more than $30.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,051,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,442,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,082,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,658,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as late stage lending loans. Other targeted characteristics of late stage lending businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower's high revenue growth is\nsupported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we may adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2018, one stop loans included $27,714,298 of late stage lending loans at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had debt and equity investments in 54 portfolio companies. The weighted average annualized income yield and weighted average annualized investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value and the total return based on the change in the net asset value of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized income yield(1)\n</td> <td>9.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized investment income yield(2)\n</td> <td>9.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on average net asset value(3)\n</td> <td>11.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total return based on net asset value per share(4)\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees and discounts divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \n (2) Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us. \n (3) Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets.

As of September 30, 2018, GBDC 3 has earned an inception-to-date internal rate of return, or IRR, of 11.8% for stockholders taken as a whole. For the year ended September 30, 2018, GBDC 3 has earned a year-to-date IRR of 11.8% for stockholders taken as a whole. An individual stockholder's IRR may vary based on the timing of their capital transactions. The IRR is the annualized effective compound rate of return that brings a series of cash flows to the current value of the cash invested. The IRR was computed based on the actual dates of cash inflows (share issuances, including share issuances through the DRIP), outflows (capital distributions), the stockholders' net asset value, or NAV, at the end of the period and distributions declared and payable at the end of the period (residual value of the stockholders' NAV and distributions payable as of each measurement date).\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n \u2022 reimbursement to GC Advisors of organizational and offering expenses up to an aggregate amount of $700,000; \n \u2022 calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); \n \u2022 fees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses may include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies that may be commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses; \n \u2022 expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors; \n \u2022 transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 U.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees; \n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; \n \u2022 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; \n \u2022 costs associated with individual or group stockholders; \n \u2022 costs associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 our allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; \n \u2022 proxy voting expenses; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. \nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nRecent Developments\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through December 7, 2018, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We believe these factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore more market opportunities for us.\nMarket Environment: We believe that as part of the path of economic recovery following the credit crisis, there has been increased competition for new middle-market investments due to some new non-bank finance companies that have entered the market and due to improving financial performance of middle-market companies. However, we believe that our scale and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nConsolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2018 are as follows:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,549,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from accretion of discounts and origination fees\n</td> <td>317,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee income\n</td> <td>131,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>4,999,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expenses\n</td> <td>2,512,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income - before excise tax\n</td> <td>2,486,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excise tax\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income - after excise tax\n</td> <td>2,485,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>1,581,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,067,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average earning portfolio company investments, at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,537,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we commenced operations on October 2, 2017, no income was earned during the periods prior to September 30, 2017.\nInvestment Income\nThe income yield by debt security type for the year ended September 30, 2018 was as follows:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>6.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>9.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt (1)\n</td> <td>8.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Represents one portfolio company investment.

Unrealized appreciation during the year ended September 30, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value primarily due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts and negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value of portfolio company investments during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $3,642,969. During the period we used $138,976,149 in operating activities, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments of $150,024,831. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was $142,619,118, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $214,450,000 and proceeds from the issuance of common shares of $85,912,100 that were partially offset by repayments of debt of $155,950,000.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,653,469. Cash and cash equivalents are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investor capital subscriptions totaling $470,440,500 of which $85,922,600 had been called and contributed, leaving $384,517,900 of uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the SMBC Revolver, allowed us to borrow up to $110,000,000 at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2018, we had $58,500,000 outstanding under the SMBC Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had $51,500,000 of remaining commitments and $51,500,000 of availability under the SMBC Revolver.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we were permitted to borrow up to $40,000,000 at any one time outstanding, under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolver.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. The SBCAA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements, obtains certain approvals and, in the case of unlisted business development companies, makes an offer to repurchase the shares of its stockholders. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirement to a business development company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, of such business development company's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such business development company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder\napproval. We are still evaluating the merits of operating with a higher leverage ratio, and have not sought or obtained either approval and, as a result, remain subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement under Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 248.8%.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $51,432,478. This amount may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2018, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of drawings upon unfunded commitments and cash balances that we maintain, availability under our SMBC Revolver and Revolver, ongoing principal repayments on debt investments assets and uncalled investor capital subscriptions.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through net proceeds from capital calls on existing and future investor capital subscriptions and through our dividend reinvestment plan as well as future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing in capital generated by repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had investments in 54 portfolio companies with a total fair value $143,658,485.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the year ended September 30, 2018:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>New Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\nCommitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,401,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One stop\n</td> <td>182,661,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>81,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>1,957,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total new investment commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,102,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the principal, amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class:\n "}
