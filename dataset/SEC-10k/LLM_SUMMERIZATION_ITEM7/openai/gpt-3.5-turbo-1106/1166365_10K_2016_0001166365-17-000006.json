This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\ufeff\nAmendments to the Credit Agreement\n\ufeff\nOn June 24, 2016, Appvion, PDC, Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, Fifth Third Bank, as revolver agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the parties other than Appvion and PDC, the Lending Parties\u201d) entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fourth Amendment amends the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for an additional add-back to Consolidated Net Income for cash, fees and/or expenses paid or incurred in connection with certain financial and advisory services provided to the Company and Appvion in an aggregate amount not to exceed $6.5 million.\n\ufeff\nOn January 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fifth Amendment, among other things, (i) fixes the applicable interest rate on the Company's term and revolving loans at 5.5% per annum for base rate loans and 6.5% per annum for Eurodollar loans, regardless of the Company's then current consolidated leverage ratio, (ii) increases the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratios applicable to the Company pursuant to the maximum consolidated leverage covenant to require maintenance of a consolidated first lien leverage ratio, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.60 to 1.00, during the second fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, during the period beginning on the third fiscal quarter of 2017 though the second fiscal quarter of 2018, of not more than 3.25 to 1.00 and from and after July 1, 2018, of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 and (iii) requires the payment of a 1.5% premium on any prepayments, payments in connection with a change in control or a refinancing or payments at maturity of either term or revolving loans.\n\ufeff\nOn February 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Sixth Amendment (the Sixth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to provide for the availability of additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20.0 million, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as the term loans already existing under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of these term loans were reduced by $0.8 million for original issue discount and the net proceeds were used to pay down the revolving line of credit.\n\ufeff\n2016 Financial Highlights\n\ufeff\nNet sales totaled $690.4 million, a $9.6 million, or 1.4%, decrease from 2015 net sales. Shipment volumes were approximately 2% lower than in 2015. Thermal papers net sales were up 8.7% with shipment volumes approximately 6% higher than the prior year. Current year carbonless papers net sales were lower than 2015 net sales by 12.9% and shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower.\n\ufeff\nCurrent year cost of sales of $566.3 million was $10.1 million, or 1.8%, lower than 2015 cost of sales. Current year cost of sales includes a mark-to-market loss of $1.5 million related to the Company's retiree benefit plans. This compares to a retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $2.4 million recorded in cost of sales at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nSG&A spending of $100.6 million was $12.5 million, or 11.1%, lower than 2015 spending. During 2016, the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss in SG&A, related to its retiree benefit plans, of $0.5 million. This compares to a mark-to-market loss of $1.1 million recorded in SG&A during 2015. Current year compensation and distribution expenses were lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company paid the final payment toward the Fox River Funding Agreement, satisfying its obligations under the Funding Agreement. For further discussion, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2016, Appvion successfully completed compliance with the Boiler MACT regulations issued by the EPA. The project was completed safely, on time, and under budget.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2016 and 2015\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain. The Company recorded 2016 net loss of $19.0 million compared to net income of $158.6 million in 2015.\n\ufeff\nReportable Segments\n\ufeff\nThe Company creates product solutions for customers and end users through its development and use of coating formulations and applications as well as security technologies. The Company has two reportable segments: thermal papers and carbonless papers.\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers market is growing with new applications being developed to use thermal technology. Based on its assessment of the period 2011 through 2016, the Company believes North American thermal markets expanded at a 2% compound average growth rate, with annual rates ranging from increases of 1% to 3%. The Company believes demand for thermal paper will continue to grow in North America and around the world. Sales of thermal papers accounted for approximately 59% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes with domestic producers and imports from Europe and Asia based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment includes carbonless, security and other specialty paper products. The Company believes the North American market for carbonless paper products has been in decline since 1994 as a result of greater use of competing technologies such as digital laser, inkjet and thermal printers and electronic communications. The Company believes the North American carbonless paper market declined by approximately 7% to 10% annually from 2011 through 2016. The decline is expected to continue at historical rates over the next several years. The Company believes the worldwide carbonless market is also in decline, with demand declining at approximately 3% to 6% per year. The carbonless papers segment accounted for approximately 41% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers market is highly competitive. The Company competes based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service. In addition to declining North American and foreign carbonless markets, the carbonless business continues to experience competitive pricing from foreign and domestic producers. Other domestic carbonless producers have continued their competitive pricing strategies in efforts to maintain or gain share. In addition, foreign competitors continue to sell into the North American carbonless market with low-price strategies. As a result of this increased pricing competition, the Company has continued to experience pressure on selling prices for carbonless products. Nevertheless, market conditions permit the Company to implement price increases from time to time to offset the increasing costs of raw materials.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Segment Discussion - 2016\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\nThermal papers 2016 net sales of $405.4 million were $32.5 million, or 8.7%, higher than 2015 while shipment volumes of thermal papers increased nearly 6% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products grew almost 11% year-on-year and shipments of receipt paper were approximately the same as the prior year. Net sales also benefited from favorable price and product mix.\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers segment recorded 2016 operating income of $14.3 million compared to a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million, an increase of $20.1 million. Current year operating earnings were $5.2 million higher due to increased shipment volumes. In addition, pricing and product mix were $10.0 million favorable, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of $1.9 million. Continued improvements in manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives added $4.7 million. Thermal papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $0.2 million, and unfavorable variance of $2.2 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015. In addition, distribution costs were lower by $1.4 million and other SG&A spending was $2.7 million lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2016 net sales totaled $284.9 million, a decrease of $42.3 million, or 12.9%, from the prior year. Current year shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower than 2015 shipments. Despite volume declines in this segment, specialty papers volume grew more than 13% from the prior year.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment recorded current year operating income of $17.2 million compared to 2015 operating income of $26.7 million, a decrease of $9.5 million. Current year earnings were $18.6 million lower compared to the prior year due to reduced shipment volumes, $6.8 million unfavorable due to pricing and mix, and $0.6 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $10.8 million and $4.7 million of lower SG&A spending. Carbonless papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $1.0 million and distribution costs of $2.0, and unfavorable variance of $2.0 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2016, unallocated corporate charges totaled $8.1 million compared to $10.4 million last year. Corporate unallocated charges included $1.6 million charge for consulting fees.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2015 and 2014\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

Shipment volumes were approximately 4% lower than in 2014.\n\ufeff\nOperating income of $10.5 million was recorded in 2015 compared to an operating loss of $56.9 million in 2014. During 2015, improvements in manufacturing operations, as well as cost savings initiatives, reduced manufacturing costs by $30.1 million compared to 2014. This reduction was partially offset by $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to the downtime associated with recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring mill. In addition, a mark-to-market loss of $3.5 million, related to the Company's retiree benefit plans, was recorded in 2015 which compared to the retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $63.2 million recorded in 2014. Of this $59.7 million mark-to-market difference, $42.2 million was in cost of sales and $17.5 million was in SG&A. Unfavorable price and product mix, all of which was incurred within the thermal papers segment due to foreign competition driving down the price of receipt paper, reduced operating results by $35.7 million. Lower shipment volumes negatively impacted current year financial results by $14.3 million. SG&A spending was $27.2 million lower than 2014 due to reductions in compensation and distribution expenses. In addition, 2014 legal expenses were higher due to Fox River settlement matters and anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims related to imports of certain lightweight thermal paper. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $24.0 million charge for the Fox River Funding Agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFiscal year 2015 interest expense was $3.1 million lower than in 2014 as the Company used proceeds from the third quarter 2015 sale of the Encapsys Business to repay $170.0 million of first lien term debt. The 2015 results also include debt modification expense of $3.6 million related to the write-off of previously-deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with this repayment of first lien term debt and the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit.\n\ufeff\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a loss from continuing of operations of $41.9 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $109.0 million in the previous year. Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain.

During 2015, shipment volumes of thermal papers decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products were flat year-on-year while shipments of receipt paper were approximately 4% lower than in 2014. This segment recorded a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $11.4 million. The 2015 results included a $0.9 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $24.1 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results decreased by $17.6 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing and product mix of $36.8 million, largely due to foreign competition. Unfavorable pricing and product mix was partially offset by improved manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives of $15.7 million. In addition, SG&A spending was $7.7 million lower than in 2014 because 2014 expenses included higher legal fees associated with anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2015 net sales totaled $327.2 million, a decrease of $22.2 million, or 6.4%, from the prior year. The 2015 shipment volumes were approximately 6% lower than 2014 shipments. This segment recorded current year operating income of $26.7 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $12.6 million. The 2015 income included a $2.3 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $40.5 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results increased by $1.1 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $14.4 million and $3.5 million of lower SG&A spending. These favorable items were offset by $11.8 million of reduced profits due to lower shipment volumes, as well as $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania mill.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2015, unallocated corporate charges totaled $10.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. The 2014 results included the $24.0 million charge related to the Fox River Funding Agreement as well as related legal fees.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided by operations and credit available under its revolving credit facility. The Company expects that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and available credit from its revolving credit facility, will provide the necessary funds for the reasonably foreseeable operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, debt service, other contractual obligations and capital expenditures). At December 31, 2016, the Company had $6.4 million of cash and, in accordance with its debt covenants, approximately $16.3 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. At that date, the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31.9 million compared to $9.6 million at year-end 2015. Approximately $15.0 million of revolving credit facility commitment was used in the form of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2016, net debt (total debt less cash) was $432.1 million compared to $413.5 million at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nManagement reported that the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and is forecasted to remain compliant for the next 12 months. The Company's ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future depends on achieving forecasted operating results and operating cash flows. The Company's failure to comply with its covenants, or an assessment that it is likely to fail to comply with its covenants, could lead the Company to seek amendments to, or waivers of, the financial covenants. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain any amendments to or waivers of the covenants. In the event of noncompliance with debt covenants, if the lenders will not amend or waive the Company's noncompliance with the covenants, the outstanding debt would become due and the Company would need to seek alternative financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances. If the Company were not able to secure alternative financing, this would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used by operating activities during 2016 was $0.7 million compared to $9.5 million in 2015. In addition to a net loss of $19.0 million, noncash charges totaling $31.5 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $26.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $1.6 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $3.1 million of other net noncash charges. During 2016, working capital increased by $13.2 million. This was the result of a $14.4 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, largely due to the Company making the final $7.5 million payment in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement. In addition, accounts receivable increased by $0.3 million. This was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in inventories and a $0.3 million decrease in other current assets. During 2016, a mark-to-market pension loss of $3.3 million was recorded, accounting for much of the $3.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $3.6 million included a $1.4 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used by operating activities during 2015 was $9.5 million compared to $47.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. In addition to a net income of $158.6 million, noncash charges totaling $38.9 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $27.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $3.6 million of debt modification expense, $1.9 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $5.6 million of other net noncash charges. In addition, a $188.7 million gain on the sale of the Encapsys Business was recorded during the current year period. During 2015, working capital increased by $14.4 million. This was largely the result of a $26.8 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to the Company making $11.5 million of payments in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement, as well as paying its accounts payable sooner to take advantage of favorable vendor payment terms. This was partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $5.5 million decrease in inventories and a $2.0 million decrease in other current assets. During 2015, a mark-to-market pension loss of $10.3 million was recorded, accounting for the $7.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $11.8 million included an $8.3 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $47.2 million compared to $22.7 million of net cash used by operating activities in 2013. In addition to a net loss of $92.8 million, noncash charges and gains totaling $37.8 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $30.0 million in depreciation and amortization, $2.3 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP, $2.1 million of foreign exchange loss and $3.4 million of other net noncash charges. During 2014, working capital decreased by $41.4 million. A significant component of this decrease was the $23.8 million decrease in accounts receivable. During June 2014, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a commitment size of $30.0 million, whereby transactions under the program are accounted for as sales of trade receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing.\u201d Sales of trade receivables under the program are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2015. Proceeds received, including collections on the deferred purchase price notes receivable, are included in cash flows from operating activities. As of year-end 2014, the accounts receivable securitization resulted in a net reduction of accounts receivable of $16.8 million. In addition, the $19.4 million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities includes an $11.3 million short-term liability related to the Fox River Funding Agreement signed on September 30, 2014. During 2014, a $16.1 million contribution was made to the pension plan and a mark-to-market loss of $67.4 million was recorded, accounting for the majority of the $53.2 increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash provided of $7.6 million includes the $6.9 million long-term portion of the Fox River Funding Agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Current year net cash used by investing activities was $14.7 million. This amount included $14.8 million used for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment and $0.1 million of sale proceeds. During 2015, net cash provided by investing activities was $183.9 million. This included a $200.5 million increase to cash resulting from the sale of the Encapsys Business during the third quarter. In addition, $16.7 million was spent for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. During 2014, net cash used by investing activities was $17.5 million. This amount included $19.7 million used for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and $2.2 million of sale proceeds, primarily from the second quarter 2014 auction of papermaking equipment located at the West Carrollton, Ohio facility.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. During 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $19.9 million. The Company made mandatory debt repayments of $1.6 million on its State of Ohio loans. The Company also borrowed a net $22.3 million on its revolving credit facility.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2016, proceeds from the issuance of PDC redeemable common stock totaled $1.6 million. The ESOP trustee purchased this stock using pre-tax deferrals, rollovers and loan payments made by employees during 2016. Current year payments to redeem PDC common stock were $10.2 million. Cash overdrafts increased $7.9 million during 2016.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2015, net cash used by financing activities was $175.2 million. During third quarter 2015, the Company repaid $170.0 million on its first lien term loan using proceeds from the sale of its Encapsys Business. In addition, it made mandatory debt repayments of $2.5 million on its first lien term loan. It also made mandatory debt repayments of $1.5 million on its State of Ohio loans. During the year, the Company borrowed a net $3.2 million on its revolving credit facility. The Company incurred $0.9 million of debt acquisition costs related to the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement.

The ESOP trustee purchased this stock using pre-tax deferrals, rollovers and loan payments made by employees during 2015. Current year payments to redeem PDC common stock were $9.4 million.\n\ufeff\nCash overdrafts increased $4.2 million during 2015. Cash overdrafts represent short-term obligations, in excess of deposits on hand, which have not yet cleared through the banking system. Fluctuations in the balance are a function of quarter-end payment patterns and the speed with which the payees deposit the checks.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2014, net cash used by financing activities was $28.8 million. The Company made mandatory debt repayments of $3.3 million on its first lien term loan and $1.4 million on its State of Ohio loans.

Employees may defer, on a pre-tax basis, a percentage of their pay in an amount, subject to certain IRS limitations, equal to between 2% and 50% of their annual compensation. Participants have the option of directing their deferrals to the 401(k) Fund, the Company Stock Fund or a combination of both. The Company believes that new deferrals from employees into the Company Stock Fund for the five-year period presented above will aggregate approximately $6.8 million and could be used to fund a portion of the repurchase liability set forth in the table above. Based upon the estimated fair value of redeemable common stock of 6,260,418 shares outstanding at $10.35 per share at December 31, 2016, an ultimate redemption liability of $64.8 million was determined.\n\ufeff\nDeferrals directed to the Company Stock Fund accumulate in a short-term interest-bearing account within the ESOP trust until the next valuation date, June 30 or December 31. At that time, these deferrals and the interest earned on these amounts, are used to purchase shares based upon the price of a share of PDC common stock on the valuation date preceding or following the date on which the participant made the deferrals, whichever is lower.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEffects of Inflation. Prices for certain raw materials, including base stock and chemicals, as well as costs for natural gas, oil and electricity have been subject to price changes and can have material effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations. Prices for certain raw materials increased during 2016 and could continue to increase, or decrease, in response to changes in demand. The Company historically has been able to use price increases to recoup a portion of raw material price increases, but relies on cost-cutting measures and productivity and efficiency gains to offset the remaining portion of raw material price increases. While the Company expects that any significant increase in raw materials or energy costs will be offset by price increases and/or by cost containment and productivity and efficiency initiatives, profitability could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to pass on or mitigate any future cost increases.\n\ufeff\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n\ufeff\nManufacturing employees at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Appleton, Wisconsin, Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania and West Carrollton, Ohio are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union. The Company has labor agreements in effect with represented employees at the Appleton plant through August 31, 2017; at the Roaring Spring mill through February 1, 2018; and at the West Carrollton plant through March 31, 2018.\nUSW also represents employees at the Appleton, Wisconsin distribution center. Employees at the distribution centers in Ohio and Kansas City are not represented.\nDisclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value. The Company does not engage in any trading activities that include non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value.\nDisclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related and Certain Other Parties. There were no significant transactions with related and certain other parties.\n\ufeff\nDisclosures About Critical Accounting Policies\nPDC prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\n\ufeff\nThis requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting policies are disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\ufeff\nRedeemable Common Stock. In accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,\u201d the appropriate accounting for redeemable equity first depends upon a determination of whether the equity is currently redeemable or not currently redeemable. Shares that are currently redeemable are recorded at redemption value. For shares that are not currently redeemable, the accounting guidance allows for changes in redemption value to be accreted from the initial issuance date to the earliest redemption date. This guidance also specifies that if the redemption value is less than the original issuance cost, the carrying amount of the redeemable common stock should not be less than the original issuance cost. The fair value of redeemable common stock is determined by an independent, third-party appraiser selected by the ESOP Trustee, as required by law and the ESOP. Based upon the estimated fair value of redeemable common stock of 6,260,418 shares outstanding at $10.35 per share at December 31, 2016, an ultimate redemption liability of $64.8 million was determined. The redeemable common stock recorded book value as of December 31, 2016, was $100.6 million.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes. In conjunction with the acquisition of Appvion, PDC elected to be treated as a subchapter S corporation and elected that its eligible subsidiaries be treated as qualified subchapter S subsidiaries for U.S. federal and, where recognized, state and local income tax purposes, and therefore, the Company anticipates that it will not incur any future U.S. federal income tax liability and minimal state and local income tax liabilities. Appvion's Canadian subsidiary, Appvion Canada, Ltd., is not eligible for treatment as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. As a result, the Company will incur a foreign tax liability. The Company's income tax reserve at December 31, 2016, covers various audit issues and provisions for certain non-U.S. entities. All U.S. federal C corporation tax years are closed. Various Canadian and state tax years remain open.\n\ufeff\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment test, principally in determining the fair value of the respective indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\n\ufeff\nOther intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. These intangible assets, as well as long-lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized by the Company when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a selling arrangement exists; the Company's price to the customer is fixed; collectability is reasonably assured; and title has transferred to the customer. These criteria are met at the time of shipment. Estimated costs for sales incentives, discounts and sales returns and allowances are recorded as sales reductions in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The Company typically does not invoice its customers for shipping and handling fees, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSales Returns and Allowances. A reserve is established for expected sales returns and allowances. The amount of the reserve is based on historic sales and returns and allowances data, which is analyzed by product line and market channel to determine average returns and allowances as a percent of gross sales. This percentage is applied to recent sales activity and is adjusted, as necessary, for any significant known claims or trends.\nEmployee Benefit Plans. The Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses immediately in net periodic cost annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year and, the market-related value of plan assets used in the cost calculations is equal to fair value.\n\ufeff\nThe determination of the Company's obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits, such as retiree healthcare and life insurance, is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions include, among others and where applicable, the discount rate and rates of increase in healthcare costs. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, when appropriate.\n\ufeff\nThe discount rate is developed by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan. This portfolio is selected from a universe of over 700 Aa-graded noncallable bonds available in the market as of December 31, 2016, further limited to those bonds with average yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds selected to the discounted value of the plan's benefit payments. Based on the methodology described above, and a selected portfolio of 21 bonds, the Company selected a discount rate of 4.21% for 2016 to value year-end liabilities for the pension plans. The discount rate used at year-end 2015 was 4.58%.\n\ufeff\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is developed considering the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. Expected returns for each asset class are developed using estimates of expected real returns plus expected inflation. Long-term expected real returns are derived from future expectations for the U.S. Treasury real yield curve. Based on the assumptions and methodology described above, the Company selected 7.00% as its long-term rate of return on assets assumption for both year-end 2016 and 2015.\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect its pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental and Legal Matters\nThe Company's operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing emissions of air pollutants, discharges of wastewater and storm water, storage, treatment and disposal of materials and waste, remediation of soil, surface water and groundwater contamination and liability for damages to natural resources. In addition, the Company is also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous chemicals in the workplace.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is an important facet of the business. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately $0.2 million from 2017 and a total of approximately $.9 million from 2018 through 2022 to maintain compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations and to meet new regulatory requirements. The Company expects to continue to incur expenditures after 2022 to maintain compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations and to meet new regulatory requirements.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may be subject to strict and, under some circumstances, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination, including contamination caused by other parties, at properties that it owns or operates and at properties where the Company or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of regulated materials. As a result, the Company may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters. The total amount of any future costs with respect to legal proceedings related to environmental matters and or with respect to other environmental liabilities may be material.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company may be involved from time to time in certain administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries related to environmental matters. For a discussion of environmental matters, see Item 1. Business - Environmental\u201d and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, from time to time the Company may be subject to various demands, claims, suits or other legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. A comprehensive insurance program is maintained to provide a measure of financial protection against such matters, though not all such exposures are, or can be, addressed by insurance. Estimated costs are recorded for such demands, claims, suits or proceedings of this nature when reasonably determinable. The Company has successfully defended such claims, settling some for amounts which are not material to its business and obtaining dismissals in others. While the Company will vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in any similar cases that may be brought against it in the future, there can be no assurance that it will be successful.\nThe Company does not believe that any pending or threatened demands, claims, suits or other legal or regulatory proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.\n\ufeff", "summary": "The report provides an overview of Paperweight Development Corp.'s financial condition and results of operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless stated to the contrary or the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Company refer to Paperweight Development Corp. ( PDC\u201d or Paperweight\u201d) and its 100%-owned subsidiaries. It includes Appvion, Inc. and its 100%-owned subsidiaries (collectively Appvion\u201d).\n\ufeff\n \ufeff \ufeff \nOverview\n\ufeff\nThis discussion summarizes significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial position and liquidity of PDC as of and for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\ufeff\nAmendments to the Credit Agreement\n\ufeff\nOn June 24, 2016, Appvion, PDC, Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, Fifth Third Bank, as revolver agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the parties other than Appvion and PDC, the Lending Parties\u201d) entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fourth Amendment amends the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for an additional add-back to Consolidated Net Income for cash, fees and/or expenses paid or incurred in connection with certain financial and advisory services provided to the Company and Appvion in an aggregate amount not to exceed $6.5 million.\n\ufeff\nOn January 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fifth Amendment, among other things, (i) fixes the applicable interest rate on the Company's term and revolving loans at 5.5% per annum for base rate loans and 6.5% per annum for Eurodollar loans, regardless of the Company's then current consolidated leverage ratio, (ii) increases the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratios applicable to the Company pursuant to the maximum consolidated leverage covenant to require maintenance of a consolidated first lien leverage ratio, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.60 to 1.00, during the second fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, during the period beginning on the third fiscal quarter of 2017 though the second fiscal quarter of 2018, of not more than 3.25 to 1.00 and from and after July 1, 2018, of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 and (iii) requires the payment of a 1.5% premium on any prepayments, payments in connection with a change in control or a refinancing or payments at maturity of either term or revolving loans.\n\ufeff\nOn February 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Sixth Amendment (the Sixth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to provide for the availability of additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20.0 million, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as the term loans already existing under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of these term loans were reduced by $0.8 million for original issue discount and the net proceeds were used to pay down the revolving line of credit.\n\ufeff\n2016 Financial Highlights\n\ufeff\nNet sales totaled $690.4 million, a $9.6 million, or 1.4%, decrease from 2015 net sales. Shipment volumes were approximately 2% lower than in 2015. Thermal papers net sales were up 8.7% with shipment volumes approximately 6% higher than the prior year. Current year carbonless papers net sales were lower than 2015 net sales by 12.9% and shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower.\n\ufeff\nCurrent year cost of sales of $566.3 million was $10.1 million, or 1.8%, lower than 2015 cost of sales. Current year cost of sales includes a mark-to-market loss of $1.5 million related to the Company's retiree benefit plans. This compares to a retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $2.4 million recorded in cost of sales at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nSG&A spending of $100.6 million was $12.5 million, or 11.1%, lower than 2015 spending. During 2016, the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss in SG&A, related to its retiree benefit plans, of $0.5 million. This compares to a mark-to-market loss of $1.1 million recorded in SG&A during 2015. Current year compensation and distribution expenses were lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company paid the final payment toward the Fox River Funding Agreement, satisfying its obligations under the Funding Agreement. For further discussion, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2016, Appvion successfully completed compliance with the Boiler MACT regulations issued by the EPA. The project was completed safely, on time, and under budget.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2016 and 2015\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nOperating income of $23.5 million was recorded in 2016 compared to operating income of $10.5 million in 2015, an improvement of $13.0 million. The year-on-year operating income variance was the result of the following (dollars in millions):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCurrent year interest expense was $5.4 million lower than in 2015 as the Company used proceeds from the third quarter 2015 sale of the Encapsys Business to repay $170.0 million of first lien term debt. Prior year results also include debt modification expense of $3.6 million related to the write-off of previously-deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with this repayment of first lien term debt and the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $19.0 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $41.9 million in the previous year. Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain. The Company recorded 2016 net loss of $19.0 million compared to net income of $158.6 million in 2015.\n\ufeff\nReportable Segments\n\ufeff\nThe Company creates product solutions for customers and end users through its development and use of coating formulations and applications as well as security technologies. The Company has two reportable segments: thermal papers and carbonless papers.\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers market is growing with new applications being developed to use thermal technology. Based on its assessment of the period 2011 through 2016, the Company believes North American thermal markets expanded at a 2% compound average growth rate, with annual rates ranging from increases of 1% to 3%. The Company believes demand for thermal paper will continue to grow in North America and around the world. Sales of thermal papers accounted for approximately 59% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes with domestic producers and imports from Europe and Asia based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment includes carbonless, security and other specialty paper products. The Company believes the North American market for carbonless paper products has been in decline since 1994 as a result of greater use of competing technologies such as digital laser, inkjet and thermal printers and electronic communications. The Company believes the North American carbonless paper market declined by approximately 7% to 10% annually from 2011 through 2016. The decline is expected to continue at historical rates over the next several years. The Company believes the worldwide carbonless market is also in decline, with demand declining at approximately 3% to 6% per year. The carbonless papers segment accounted for approximately 41% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers market is highly competitive. The Company competes based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service. In addition to declining North American and foreign carbonless markets, the carbonless business continues to experience competitive pricing from foreign and domestic producers. Other domestic carbonless producers have continued their competitive pricing strategies in efforts to maintain or gain share. In addition, foreign competitors continue to sell into the North American carbonless market with low-price strategies. As a result of this increased pricing competition, the Company has continued to experience pressure on selling prices for carbonless products. Nevertheless, market conditions permit the Company to implement price increases from time to time to offset the increasing costs of raw materials.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Segment Discussion - 2016\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\nThermal papers 2016 net sales of $405.4 million were $32.5 million, or 8.7%, higher than 2015 while shipment volumes of thermal papers increased nearly 6% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products grew almost 11% year-on-year and shipments of receipt paper were approximately the same as the prior year. Net sales also benefited from favorable price and product mix.\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers segment recorded 2016 operating income of $14.3 million compared to a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million, an increase of $20.1 million. Current year operating earnings were $5.2 million higher due to increased shipment volumes. In addition, pricing and product mix were $10.0 million favorable, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of $1.9 million. Continued improvements in manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives added $4.7 million. Thermal papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $0.2 million, and unfavorable variance of $2.2 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015. In addition, distribution costs were lower by $1.4 million and other SG&A spending was $2.7 million lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2016 net sales totaled $284.9 million, a decrease of $42.3 million, or 12.9%, from the prior year. Current year shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower than 2015 shipments. Despite volume declines in this segment, specialty papers volume grew more than 13% from the prior year.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment recorded current year operating income of $17.2 million compared to 2015 operating income of $26.7 million, a decrease of $9.5 million. Current year earnings were $18.6 million lower compared to the prior year due to reduced shipment volumes, $6.8 million unfavorable due to pricing and mix, and $0.6 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $10.8 million and $4.7 million of lower SG&A spending. Carbonless papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $1.0 million and distribution costs of $2.0, and unfavorable variance of $2.0 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2016, unallocated corporate charges totaled $8.1 million compared to $10.4 million last year. Corporate unallocated charges included $1.6 million charge for consulting fees.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2015 and 2014\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\nNet sales for 2015 were $700.0 million, a $64.7 million, or 8.5%, decrease from 2014 net sales. Shipment volumes were approximately 4% lower than in 2014.\n\ufeff\nOperating income of $10.5 million was recorded in 2015 compared to an operating loss of $56.9 million in 2014. During 2015, improvements in manufacturing operations, as well as cost savings initiatives, reduced manufacturing costs by $30.1 million compared to 2014. This reduction was partially offset by $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to the downtime associated with recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring mill. In addition, a mark-to-market loss of $3.5 million, related to the Company's retiree benefit plans, was recorded in 2015 which compared to the retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $63.2 million recorded in 2014. Of this $59.7 million mark-to-market difference, $42.2 million was in cost of sales and $17.5 million was in SG&A. Unfavorable price and product mix, all of which was incurred within the thermal papers segment due to foreign competition driving down the price of receipt paper, reduced operating results by $35.7 million. Lower shipment volumes negatively impacted current year financial results by $14.3 million. SG&A spending was $27.2 million lower than 2014 due to reductions in compensation and distribution expenses. In addition, 2014 legal expenses were higher due to Fox River settlement matters and anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims related to imports of certain lightweight thermal paper. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $24.0 million charge for the Fox River Funding Agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFiscal year 2015 interest expense was $3.1 million lower than in 2014 as the Company used proceeds from the third quarter 2015 sale of the Encapsys Business to repay $170.0 million of first lien term debt. The 2015 results also include debt modification expense of $3.6 million related to the write-off of previously-deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with this repayment of first lien term debt and the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit.\n\ufeff\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a loss from continuing of operations of $41.9 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $109.0 million in the previous year. Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain. In 2014, discontinued operations recorded income of $16.2 million. The Company recorded 2015 net income of $158.6 million compared to a net loss of $92.8 million in 2014.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Segment Discussion - 2015\nDuring 2015, net sales from continuing operations were $700.0 million, $64.7 million lower than 2014 net sales. The 2015 operating income of the papers business was $20.9 million compared to an operating loss of $24.0 million recorded in 2014. The year-on-year operating income variance was the result of the following (dollars in millions):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\nThermal papers 2015 net sales of $372.8 million were $42.5 million, or 10.2%, lower than 2014 net sales of $415.3 million. During 2015, shipment volumes of thermal papers decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products were flat year-on-year while shipments of receipt paper were approximately 4% lower than in 2014. This segment recorded a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $11.4 million. The 2015 results included a $0.9 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $24.1 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results decreased by $17.6 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing and product mix of $36.8 million, largely due to foreign competition. Unfavorable pricing and product mix was partially offset by improved manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives of $15.7 million. In addition, SG&A spending was $7.7 million lower than in 2014 because 2014 expenses included higher legal fees associated with anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2015 net sales totaled $327.2 million, a decrease of $22.2 million, or 6.4%, from the prior year. The 2015 shipment volumes were approximately 6% lower than 2014 shipments. This segment recorded current year operating income of $26.7 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $12.6 million. The 2015 income included a $2.3 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $40.5 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results increased by $1.1 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $14.4 million and $3.5 million of lower SG&A spending. These favorable items were offset by $11.8 million of reduced profits due to lower shipment volumes, as well as $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania mill.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2015, unallocated corporate charges totaled $10.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. The 2014 results included the $24.0 million charge related to the Fox River Funding Agreement as well as related legal fees.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided by operations and credit available under its revolving credit facility. The Company expects that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and available credit from its revolving credit facility, will provide the necessary funds for the reasonably foreseeable operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, debt service, other contractual obligations and capital expenditures). At December 31, 2016, the Company had $6.4 million of cash and, in accordance with its debt covenants, approximately $16.3 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. At that date, the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31.9 million compared to $9.6 million at year-end 2015. Approximately $15.0 million of revolving credit facility commitment was used in the form of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2016, net debt (total debt less cash) was $432.1 million compared to $413.5 million at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nManagement reported that the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and is forecasted to remain compliant for the next 12 months. The Company's ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future depends on achieving forecasted operating results and operating cash flows. The Company's failure to comply with its covenants, or an assessment that it is likely to fail to comply with its covenants, could lead the Company to seek amendments to, or waivers of, the financial covenants. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain any amendments to or waivers of the covenants. In the event of noncompliance with debt covenants, if the lenders will not amend or waive the Company's noncompliance with the covenants, the outstanding debt would become due and the Company would need to seek alternative financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances. If the Company were not able to secure alternative financing, this would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used by operating activities during 2016 was $0.7 million compared to $9.5 million in 2015. In addition to a net loss of $19.0 million, noncash charges totaling $31.5 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $26.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $1.6 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $3.1 million of other net noncash charges. During 2016, working capital increased by $13.2 million. This was the result of a $14.4 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, largely due to the Company making the final $7.5 million payment in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement. In addition, accounts receivable increased by $0.3 million. This was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in inventories and a $0.3 million decrease in other current assets. During 2016, a mark-to-market pension loss of $3.3 million was recorded, accounting for much of the $3.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $3.6 million included a $1.4 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used by operating activities during 2015 was $9.5 million compared to $47.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. In addition to a net income of $158.6 million, noncash charges totaling $38.9 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $27.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $3.6 million of debt modification expense, $1.9 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $5.6 million of other net noncash charges. In addition, a $188.7 million gain on the sale of the Encapsys Business was recorded during the current year period. During 2015, working capital increased by $14.4 million. This was largely the result of a $26.8 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to the Company making $11.5 million of payments in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement, as well as paying its accounts payable sooner to take advantage of favorable vendor payment terms. This was partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $5.5 million decrease in inventories and a $2.0 million decrease in other current assets. During 2015, a mark-to-market pension loss of $10.3 million was recorded, accounting for the $7.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $11.8 million included an $8.3 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $47.2 million compared to $22.7 million of net cash used by operating activities in 2013. In addition to a net loss of $92.8 million, noncash charges and gains totaling $37.8 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $30.0 million in depreciation and amortization, $2.3 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP, $2.1 million of foreign exchange loss and $3.4 million of other net noncash charges. During 2014, working capital decreased by $41.4 million. A significant component of this decrease was the $23.8 million decrease in accounts receivable. During June 2014, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a commitment size of $30.0 million, whereby transactions under the program are accounted for as sales of trade receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing.\u201d Sales of trade receivables under the program are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless stated to the contrary or the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Company refer to Paperweight Development Corp. ( PDC\u201d or Paperweight\u201d) and its 100%-owned subsidiaries. It includes Appvion, Inc. and its 100%-owned subsidiaries (collectively Appvion\u201d).\n\ufeff\n \ufeff \ufeff \nOverview\n\ufeff\nThis discussion summarizes significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial position and liquidity of PDC as of and for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\ufeff\nAmendments to the Credit Agreement\n\ufeff\nOn June 24, 2016, Appvion, PDC, Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, Fifth Third Bank, as revolver agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the parties other than Appvion and PDC, the Lending Parties\u201d) entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fourth Amendment amends the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for an additional add-back to Consolidated Net Income for cash, fees and/or expenses paid or incurred in connection with certain financial and advisory services provided to the Company and Appvion in an aggregate amount not to exceed $6.5 million.\n\ufeff\nOn January 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Fifth Amendment, among other things, (i) fixes the applicable interest rate on the Company's term and revolving loans at 5.5% per annum for base rate loans and 6.5% per annum for Eurodollar loans, regardless of the Company's then current consolidated leverage ratio, (ii) increases the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratios applicable to the Company pursuant to the maximum consolidated leverage covenant to require maintenance of a consolidated first lien leverage ratio, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.60 to 1.00, during the second fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, during the period beginning on the third fiscal quarter of 2017 though the second fiscal quarter of 2018, of not more than 3.25 to 1.00 and from and after July 1, 2018, of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 and (iii) requires the payment of a 1.5% premium on any prepayments, payments in connection with a change in control or a refinancing or payments at maturity of either term or revolving loans.\n\ufeff\nOn February 16, 2017, Appvion, PDC, and the Lending Parties entered into a Sixth Amendment (the Sixth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement dated June 28, 2013. The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to provide for the availability of additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20.0 million, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as the term loans already existing under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the issuance of these term loans were reduced by $0.8 million for original issue discount and the net proceeds were used to pay down the revolving line of credit.\n\ufeff\n2016 Financial Highlights\n\ufeff\nNet sales totaled $690.4 million, a $9.6 million, or 1.4%, decrease from 2015 net sales. Shipment volumes were approximately 2% lower than in 2015. Thermal papers net sales were up 8.7% with shipment volumes approximately 6% higher than the prior year. Current year carbonless papers net sales were lower than 2015 net sales by 12.9% and shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower.\n\ufeff\nCurrent year cost of sales of $566.3 million was $10.1 million, or 1.8%, lower than 2015 cost of sales. Current year cost of sales includes a mark-to-market loss of $1.5 million related to the Company's retiree benefit plans. This compares to a retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $2.4 million recorded in cost of sales at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nSG&A spending of $100.6 million was $12.5 million, or 11.1%, lower than 2015 spending. During 2016, the Company recorded a mark-to-market loss in SG&A, related to its retiree benefit plans, of $0.5 million. This compares to a mark-to-market loss of $1.1 million recorded in SG&A during 2015. Current year compensation and distribution expenses were lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\nOn October 3, 2016, the Company paid the final payment toward the Fox River Funding Agreement, satisfying its obligations under the Funding Agreement. For further discussion, see Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2016, Appvion successfully completed compliance with the Boiler MACT regulations issued by the EPA. The project was completed safely, on time, and under budget.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2016 and 2015\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Prior year results also include debt modification expense of $3.6 million related to the write-off of previously-deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with this repayment of first lien term debt and the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $19.0 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $41.9 million in the previous year. Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain. The Company recorded 2016 net loss of $19.0 million compared to net income of $158.6 million in 2015.\n\ufeff\nReportable Segments\n\ufeff\nThe Company creates product solutions for customers and end users through its development and use of coating formulations and applications as well as security technologies. The Company has two reportable segments: thermal papers and carbonless papers.\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers market is growing with new applications being developed to use thermal technology. Based on its assessment of the period 2011 through 2016, the Company believes North American thermal markets expanded at a 2% compound average growth rate, with annual rates ranging from increases of 1% to 3%. The Company believes demand for thermal paper will continue to grow in North America and around the world. Sales of thermal papers accounted for approximately 59% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes with domestic producers and imports from Europe and Asia based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment includes carbonless, security and other specialty paper products. The Company believes the North American market for carbonless paper products has been in decline since 1994 as a result of greater use of competing technologies such as digital laser, inkjet and thermal printers and electronic communications. The Company believes the North American carbonless paper market declined by approximately 7% to 10% annually from 2011 through 2016. The decline is expected to continue at historical rates over the next several years. The Company believes the worldwide carbonless market is also in decline, with demand declining at approximately 3% to 6% per year. The carbonless papers segment accounted for approximately 41% of total company net sales in 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers market is highly competitive. The Company competes based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, quality, and customer service. In addition to declining North American and foreign carbonless markets, the carbonless business continues to experience competitive pricing from foreign and domestic producers. Other domestic carbonless producers have continued their competitive pricing strategies in efforts to maintain or gain share. In addition, foreign competitors continue to sell into the North American carbonless market with low-price strategies. As a result of this increased pricing competition, the Company has continued to experience pressure on selling prices for carbonless products. Nevertheless, market conditions permit the Company to implement price increases from time to time to offset the increasing costs of raw materials.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Segment Discussion - 2016\n\ufeff\nThermal Papers\nThermal papers 2016 net sales of $405.4 million were $32.5 million, or 8.7%, higher than 2015 while shipment volumes of thermal papers increased nearly 6% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products grew almost 11% year-on-year and shipments of receipt paper were approximately the same as the prior year. Net sales also benefited from favorable price and product mix.\n\ufeff\nThe thermal papers segment recorded 2016 operating income of $14.3 million compared to a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million, an increase of $20.1 million. Current year operating earnings were $5.2 million higher due to increased shipment volumes. In addition, pricing and product mix were $10.0 million favorable, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of $1.9 million. Continued improvements in manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives added $4.7 million. Thermal papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $0.2 million, and unfavorable variance of $2.2 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015. In addition, distribution costs were lower by $1.4 million and other SG&A spending was $2.7 million lower than in 2015.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2016 net sales totaled $284.9 million, a decrease of $42.3 million, or 12.9%, from the prior year. Current year shipment volumes were approximately 10% lower than 2015 shipments. Despite volume declines in this segment, specialty papers volume grew more than 13% from the prior year.\n\ufeff\nThe carbonless papers segment recorded current year operating income of $17.2 million compared to 2015 operating income of $26.7 million, a decrease of $9.5 million. Current year earnings were $18.6 million lower compared to the prior year due to reduced shipment volumes, $6.8 million unfavorable due to pricing and mix, and $0.6 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $10.8 million and $4.7 million of lower SG&A spending. Carbonless papers also had a favorable mark-to-market variance of $1.0 million and distribution costs of $2.0, and unfavorable variance of $2.0 million for consulting fees, compared to 2015.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2016, unallocated corporate charges totaled $8.1 million compared to $10.4 million last year. Corporate unallocated charges included $1.6 million charge for consulting fees.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nComparison 2015 and 2014\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

Shipment volumes were approximately 4% lower than in 2014.\n\ufeff\nOperating income of $10.5 million was recorded in 2015 compared to an operating loss of $56.9 million in 2014. During 2015, improvements in manufacturing operations, as well as cost savings initiatives, reduced manufacturing costs by $30.1 million compared to 2014. This reduction was partially offset by $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to the downtime associated with recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring mill. In addition, a mark-to-market loss of $3.5 million, related to the Company's retiree benefit plans, was recorded in 2015 which compared to the retiree plan mark-to-market loss of $63.2 million recorded in 2014. Of this $59.7 million mark-to-market difference, $42.2 million was in cost of sales and $17.5 million was in SG&A. Unfavorable price and product mix, all of which was incurred within the thermal papers segment due to foreign competition driving down the price of receipt paper, reduced operating results by $35.7 million. Lower shipment volumes negatively impacted current year financial results by $14.3 million. SG&A spending was $27.2 million lower than 2014 due to reductions in compensation and distribution expenses. In addition, 2014 legal expenses were higher due to Fox River settlement matters and anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims related to imports of certain lightweight thermal paper. In 2014, the Company also recorded a $24.0 million charge for the Fox River Funding Agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFiscal year 2015 interest expense was $3.1 million lower than in 2014 as the Company used proceeds from the third quarter 2015 sale of the Encapsys Business to repay $170.0 million of first lien term debt. The 2015 results also include debt modification expense of $3.6 million related to the write-off of previously-deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with this repayment of first lien term debt and the execution of the Third Amendment to the Credit.\n\ufeff\nIn 2015, the Company recorded a loss from continuing of operations of $41.9 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $109.0 million in the previous year. Discontinued operations recorded income of $11.8 million through August 2, 2015, at which time the Encapsys Business was sold, resulting in a $188.7 million gain. In 2014, discontinued operations recorded income of $16.2 million. The Company recorded 2015 net income of $158.6 million compared to a net loss of $92.8 million in 2014.\n\ufeff\nBusiness Segment Discussion - 2015\nDuring 2015, net sales from continuing operations were $700.0 million, $64.7 million lower than 2014 net sales. The 2015 operating income of the papers business was $20.9 million compared to an operating loss of $24.0 million recorded in 2014.

During 2015, shipment volumes of thermal papers decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior year. Shipment volumes of tag, label and entertainment ( TLE\u201d) products were flat year-on-year while shipments of receipt paper were approximately 4% lower than in 2014. This segment recorded a 2015 operating loss of $5.8 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $11.4 million. The 2015 results included a $0.9 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $24.1 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results decreased by $17.6 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing and product mix of $36.8 million, largely due to foreign competition. Unfavorable pricing and product mix was partially offset by improved manufacturing operations and cost savings initiatives of $15.7 million. In addition, SG&A spending was $7.7 million lower than in 2014 because 2014 expenses included higher legal fees associated with anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims.\n\ufeff\nCarbonless Papers\nCarbonless papers 2015 net sales totaled $327.2 million, a decrease of $22.2 million, or 6.4%, from the prior year. The 2015 shipment volumes were approximately 6% lower than 2014 shipments. This segment recorded current year operating income of $26.7 million compared to a 2014 operating loss of $12.6 million. The 2015 income included a $2.3 million mark-to-market loss related to the Company's retiree benefit plans whereas the 2014 operating loss included a mark-to-market loss of $40.5 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses, 2015 operating results increased by $1.1 million from the prior year. The 2015 operating results were positively impacted by improved manufacturing operations of $14.4 million and $3.5 million of lower SG&A spending. These favorable items were offset by $11.8 million of reduced profits due to lower shipment volumes, as well as $4.5 million of additional manufacturing costs related primarily to recovery boiler maintenance at the Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania mill.\n\ufeff\nUnallocated Corporate Charges\nAs of year-end 2015, unallocated corporate charges totaled $10.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. The 2014 results included the $24.0 million charge related to the Fox River Funding Agreement as well as related legal fees.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided by operations and credit available under its revolving credit facility. The Company expects that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and available credit from its revolving credit facility, will provide the necessary funds for the reasonably foreseeable operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, debt service, other contractual obligations and capital expenditures). At December 31, 2016, the Company had $6.4 million of cash and, in accordance with its debt covenants, approximately $16.3 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. At that date, the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $31.9 million compared to $9.6 million at year-end 2015. Approximately $15.0 million of revolving credit facility commitment was used in the form of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2016, net debt (total debt less cash) was $432.1 million compared to $413.5 million at year-end 2015.\n\ufeff\nManagement reported that the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and is forecasted to remain compliant for the next 12 months. The Company's ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future depends on achieving forecasted operating results and operating cash flows. The Company's failure to comply with its covenants, or an assessment that it is likely to fail to comply with its covenants, could lead the Company to seek amendments to, or waivers of, the financial covenants. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain any amendments to or waivers of the covenants. In the event of noncompliance with debt covenants, if the lenders will not amend or waive the Company's noncompliance with the covenants, the outstanding debt would become due and the Company would need to seek alternative financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances. If the Company were not able to secure alternative financing, this would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used by operating activities during 2016 was $0.7 million compared to $9.5 million in 2015. In addition to a net loss of $19.0 million, noncash charges totaling $31.5 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $26.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $1.6 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $3.1 million of other net noncash charges. During 2016, working capital increased by $13.2 million. This was the result of a $14.4 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, largely due to the Company making the final $7.5 million payment in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement. In addition, accounts receivable increased by $0.3 million. This was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in inventories and a $0.3 million decrease in other current assets. During 2016, a mark-to-market pension loss of $3.3 million was recorded, accounting for much of the $3.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $3.6 million included a $1.4 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used by operating activities during 2015 was $9.5 million compared to $47.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014. In addition to a net income of $158.6 million, noncash charges totaling $38.9 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $27.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $3.6 million of debt modification expense, $1.9 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $5.6 million of other net noncash charges. In addition, a $188.7 million gain on the sale of the Encapsys Business was recorded during the current year period. During 2015, working capital increased by $14.4 million. This was largely the result of a $26.8 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to the Company making $11.5 million of payments in accordance with the Fox River Funding Agreement, as well as paying its accounts payable sooner to take advantage of favorable vendor payment terms. This was partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $5.5 million decrease in inventories and a $2.0 million decrease in other current assets. During 2015, a mark-to-market pension loss of $10.3 million was recorded, accounting for the $7.9 million increase in accrued pension. Other, net cash used of $11.8 million included an $8.3 million postretirement health mark-to-market gain.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $47.2 million compared to $22.7 million of net cash used by operating activities in 2013. In addition to a net loss of $92.8 million, noncash charges and gains totaling $37.8 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $30.0 million in depreciation and amortization, $2.3 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP, $2.1 million of foreign exchange loss and $3.4 million of other net noncash charges. During 2014, working capital decreased by $41.4 million. A significant component of this decrease was the $23.8 million decrease in accounts receivable. During June 2014, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a commitment size of $30.0 million, whereby transactions under the program are accounted for as sales of trade receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing.\u201d Sales of trade receivables under the program are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable in"}
