Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and other materials we have filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d could,\u201d estimate,\u201d likely,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d and similar expressions, including references to assumptions.

New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, nor can we assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nKey Initiatives\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reducing costs across our entire organization,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reviewing entire portfolio of assets (complete non-core asset sales); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reviewing capital structure (allocate capital to maximize shareholder value).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Discontinued Operations / Segment Name Changes\nAt year-end 2016 we have divested substantially all of our oil and gas working interest properties. As a result of this significant change in our operations, we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these assets as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, we changed the name of the oil and gas segment to mineral resources to reflect the strategic shift from oil and gas working interest investments to owned mineral interests. We also changed the name of the other natural resources segment to other. The discussion of our results of operations is based on the results from our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended 2016, 2015 and 2014\nA summary of our consolidated results by business segment follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral resources\n</td> <td>5,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral resources\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(4,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>120,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items not allocated to segments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>(18,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based and long-term incentive compensation expense\n</td> <td>(4,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>48,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(19,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>(35,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate non-operating income\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before taxes attributable to Forestar Group Inc.\n</td> <td>90,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(15,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Forestar Group Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant aspects of our results of operations follow:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real estate segment earnings benefited from combined gains of $117,856,000 which generated combined net proceeds before debt repayment of $247,506,000 as a result of executing our key initiative to opportunistically divest non-core assets.

These impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings consideration, to market these properties for sale. In addition, earnings benefited from increased residential lot sales activity and higher undeveloped land sales from our retail sales program.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mineral resources segment earnings decreased due to lower oil and gas prices and production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other segment earnings was negatively impacted due to a $3,874,000 non-cash impairment charge of goodwill related to our central Texas water assets as a result of entering into an agreement to sell these assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative expense decreased as result of our key initiative to reduce costs across our entire organization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gain on sale of assets of $48,891,000 represents the sale of over 58,300 acres of timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and Alabama in three separate transactions for $104,172,000 in accordance with our key initiative to divest non-core assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest expense decreased primarily due to reducing our debt outstanding by $277,790,000 in 2016 and $323,303,000 since third quarter 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loss on extinguishment of debt of $35,864,000 is related to debt retirement of portions of our 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, which includes write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5,489,000 and $1,301,000 in other costs related to tender offer advisory services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real estate segment earnings declined principally due to gain on sale of assets of $25,981,000 in 2014 compared with $1,585,000 in 2015, lower undeveloped land sales and decreased residential lot sales activity.

Consumer confidence as measured by The Conference Board increased in December 2016 to its highest level since August 2001, registering 113.7 up from 109.4 in November 2016. The elevated monthly reading was attributed in part to increases in consumers' outlook for business conditions over the next six-months and more positive outlooks for the labor market and rising incomes. Builder confidence as measured by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index ended 2016 on a high note, jumping seven points to its highest reading since July 2005, largely attributable to a post-election bounce. On a monthly basis, housing starts increased significantly in December 2016 due to volatile multifamily activity, while housing permit activity, viewed as a precursor to starts increased 1.9% year over year basis ending December 2016. Home prices as measured by S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price index hit a new high in November 2016 after rising at approximately a 5.5% annual rate over the last two-and-a half years. As of the November 2016 reading, average home prices for the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the two composite indices were back to their winter 2007 levels. As of year-end 2016, finished vacant supply of new homes and vacant developed lot supply in MSAs in which Forestar's single family activity is located remained extremely tight, registering below the two month and 24 month equilibrium levels.\nOil and gas revenues are influenced by prices of, and global and domestic supply and demand for, oil and gas. These commodities as determined by both regional and global markets depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, the condition of the domestic and global economies, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, supply and demand for oil and gas and the effects of federal, state and local regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 as compared with the first half in 2015. Prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices averaged $43.33 per Bbl in 2016, nearly 11% lower than in 2015 and $48.66 per Bbl in 2015, nearly 48% lower than in 2014.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our operations through three business segments:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real estate,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mineral resources, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We evaluate performance based on segment earnings (loss) before unallocated items and income taxes. Segment earnings (loss) consist of operating income (loss), equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures', gain on sale of assets, interest income on loans secured by real estate and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Items not allocated to our business segments consist of general and administrative expenses, share-based and long-term compensation, gain on sale of strategic timberland and undeveloped land, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other corporate non-operating income and expense. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the accounting policy note to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe operate in cyclical industries. Our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates, availability of mortgage credit, consumer and home builder sentiment, new housing starts, real estate values, employment levels, changes in the market prices for oil, gas and timber, and the overall strength or weakness of the U.S. economy.\nReal Estate\nWe own directly or through ventures interests in 50 residential and mixed-use projects comprised of approximately 4,600 acres of real estate located in 10 states and 14 markets. Our real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on our lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities. We own approximately 11,000 acres of non-core timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and approximately 8,000 acres in Texas. We own and manage our projects either directly or through ventures. Our real estate segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of residential single-family lots and tracts, undeveloped land and commercial real estate, and in 2014 and 2015 from the operation of several income producing properties, primarily a hotel and multifamily properties.\nA summary of our real estate results follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>(163,095\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>(29,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(2,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on loan secured by real estate\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>117,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(1,531\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>11,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped land\n</td> <td>35,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and income producing properties\n</td> <td>13,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential real estate revenues principally consist of the sale of single-family lots to local, regional and national home builders. In 2016, residential real estate revenues increased primarily due to higher lot sales activity but were partially offset by lower average sale prices per lot as a result of selling 235 bulk lots from four non-core community development projects. Excluding these non-core sales, we sold 1,427 lots from our owned and consolidated projects at an average price of $71,300 per lot. In addition, in 2016, we sold 1,539 residential tract acres for $8,728,000 generating earnings of $847,000. In 2015, residential real estate revenues decreased primarily due to lower lot sales activity due to construction and inspection delays associated with abnormally wet weather conditions. Also, in 2015, we sold 1,062 residential tract acres for $11,223,000 generating earnings of $5,489,000, compared with 936 acres of residential tracts for $7,996,000 generating earnings of $2,988,000 in 2014.\nThe timing of commercial real estate revenues can vary depending on the demand, mix, project life-cycle, size and location of the project. In 2016, the increase in commercial real estate revenues is primarily due to selling 286 commercial acres from four non-core community development projects, of which 264 acres were sold from our San Joaquin River project in Antioch, California for $7,330,000 which provided approximately $37,400,000 in income tax losses to offset tax gains from other sales. In 2015, our commercial tract sales revenue increased principally due to higher average sales price of tracts sold. In 2015, we sold 31 commercial acres for $5,542,000 from our owned and consolidated projects, generating earnings of $3,345,000, compared with 21 commercial acres for $1,889,000, generating earnings of $444,000 in 2014.\nUndeveloped land revenues represent land sold from our retail sales program. In 2016, we sold 14,438 acres of undeveloped land for $2,485 per acre, generating approximately $28,098,000 in earnings. In 2015, we sold 9,645 acres of undeveloped land for $2,369 per acre, generating approximately $16,542,000 in earnings, compared with 21,345 acres sold for $2,181 per acre, generating earnings of $29,895,000 in 2014.\nCommercial and income producing properties revenues include revenues from sale of multifamily properties which we developed as a merchant builder and operate until sold, from hotel room sales and other guest services, rental revenues from our operating multifamily properties and reimbursement for costs paid to subcontractors plus development and construction fees from certain multifamily projects. In 2016, commercial and income producing properties revenues decreased as result of selling the Radisson Hotel & Suites, a 413 guest room hotel located in Austin, in second quarter 2016 and Eleven, a multifamily property in Austin, in first quarter 2016, and the impact of selling Midtown Cedar Hill, a multifamily property near Dallas in fourth quarter 2015 for $42,880,000. Commercial and income producing properties revenue in 2015 includes $6,238,000 in construction revenues associated with one multifamily fixed fee contract as general contractor which was substantially completed at year-end 2015, compared with $12,282,000 in 2014. The decrease in construction revenues in 2015 is primarily due to the completion of the Eleven project in second quarter 2014. In 2015, rental revenues from our multifamily operating properties were $8,380,000 compared with $1,550,000 in 2014, primarily due to the substantial completion of the Eleven multifamily project at the end of second quarter 2014 and acquiring our partner's interest in the multifamily venture in third quarter 2014.\nOther revenues primarily result from sale of stream and impervious cover credits. In 2016, we sold 24 acres of impervious cover credits to home builders for $3,232,000, generating earnings of $2,787,000 and 138,000 mitigation banking credits for $3,265,000, generating earnings of $2,137,000.\nUnits sold consist of:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned and consolidated ventures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential lots sold\n</td> <td>1,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per lot sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial acres sold\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per commercial acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped acres sold\n</td> <td>14,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ventures accounted for using the equity method:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential lots sold\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per lot sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial acres sold\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per commercial acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>589,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped acres sold\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales in 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $56,453,000 associated with six non-core community development projects and two multifamily sites, of which four non-core community development projects and one multifamily site were sold in 2016 and one multifamily site was under contract to be sold at year-end 2016 and is expected to close in 2017. The non-cash impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings considerations, to market these properties for sale. In 2015, cost of sales includes $7,781,000 related to multifamily construction contracts we incurred as general contractor and paid to subcontractors associated with our development of a multifamily venture property near Denver compared to $17,393,000 in 2014, associated with two multifamily venture properties. Included in multifamily construction contract costs are charges of $1,531,000 in 2015 reflecting estimated cost increases associated with our fixed fee contracts as general contractor for these two multifamily venture properties compared to $5,107,000 in 2014. Cost of sales in 2015 includes $33,375,000 in carrying value related to Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily property we developed as a merchant builder and sold. In addition, cost of sales includes non-cash impairment charges of $1,044,000 in 2015 and $399,000 in 2014.\nOperating expenses consist of:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property taxes\n</td> <td>5,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>5,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in operating expenses for 2016 is principally related to decrease in depreciation and amortization and property taxes associated with first quarter 2016 sale of Eleven multifamily project and fourth quarter 2015 sale of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project. The increase in operating expenses for 2015 when compared with 2014 was primarily due to increase in depreciation and amortization associated with the acquisition of Eleven multifamily project in which we previously held a 25 percent equity interest and completion of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project in 2015.\nInterest income principally represents interest received on reimbursements from utility and improvement districts. Interest income in year 2014 principally represents earnings from a loan secured by a mixed-use real estate community in Houston that was paid in full in first quarter 2015.\nIn 2016, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $95,336,000 related to sale of Radisson Hotel & Suites, a gain of $9,116,000 related to sale of Eleven, a gain of $1,223,000 associated with sale of Dillon, a gain of $10,363,000 related to sale of our interest in 3600,, a gain of $3,968,000 associated with sale of Music Row, a loss of $3,870,000 related to selling the Downtown Edge multifamily site, a gain of $1,219,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond supporting the 2014 Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) bond offering and $501,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax revenues from CCSID. The surety bond has a balance of $6,631,000 at year-end 2016. The surety bond will decrease as CCSID makes annual ad valorem tax rebate payments to San Antonio Real Estate (SARE) owner of the Resort, which obligation is scheduled to be retired in full by 2020.\nIn 2015, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $1,160,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond in connection with the CCSID bond offering in 2014 and $425,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax pledged revenues from CCSID after their payments to the debt service fund.\nIn 2014, gain on sale of assets principally includes a gain of $10,476,000 associated with a non-monetary exchange of leasehold timber rights on approximately 10,300 acres for 5,400 acres of undeveloped land with a partner in a consolidated venture, a gain of $7,610,000 related to acquiring our partner's interest in the Eleven multifamily venture, a gain of $6,577,000 related to bond proceeds received from Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) at our Cibolo Canyons project near San Antonio, and a gain of $1,318,000 associated with the sale of a land purchase option contract.\nDecreases in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower residential, commercial and undeveloped sales activity. Increase in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to increased lot sales activity associated with two projects in Houston and increased undeveloped land sales from a venture in Atlanta.\nWe underwrite real estate development projects based on a variety of assumptions incorporated into our development plans, including the timing and pricing of sales and leasing and costs to complete development. Our development plans are periodically reviewed in comparison to our return projections and expectations, and we may revise our plans as business conditions warrant. If as a result of changes to our development plans the anticipated future net cash flows are reduced such that our basis in a project is not fully recoverable, we may be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge for such project. See Part I, Item 1. Business for information about our net investment in owned and consolidated real estate by geographic location at year-end 2016.\nMineral resources\nIn 2016, we determined that our owned mineral assets were non-core and that we would explore opportunistically divesting these assets.\nAt year-end 2016, we classified our non-core mineral assets as held for sale. On February 17, 2017, we sold substantially all of our remaining oil and gas assets for a total purchase price of $85,600,000, of which $75,000,000 was received at closing. The balance of the purchase price is being held in a third-party escrow account pending completion of (a) title review, and (b) transfer of certain mineral interests owned by a venture in which the Company is a member. In first quarter 2017, we expect to recognize a gain on sale of approximately $82,400,000, of which $10,600,000 will be deferred until verification of accepted title for non-producing fee minerals in Texas and Louisiana, transfer of certain mineral interests owned by a venture in which we are a member and release of the escrowed funds. In addition, the Company expects to incur a non-cash charge of $37,900,000 related to oil and gas enterprise goodwill that is impaired due to the sale of substantially all of the Company's remaining oil and gas assets.\nOur mineral resources segment is focused on maximizing the value from our owned oil and gas mineral interests through promoting exploration, development and production activities by increasing acreage leased, lease rates, and royalty interests.\nA summary of our mineral resources results follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in cost of sales for 2016 is due to a $3,874,000 goodwill non-cash impairment charge related to our water interests in groundwater leases in central Texas as result of entering into an agreement to sell these assets which is expected to close in 2017. Excluding the non-cash impairment charge in 2016, cost of sales decreased due to deferral of timber harvest activity.\nOperating expenses principally consist of employee compensation and benefits and professional services. The decrease in operating expenses in 2016 when compared with 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to our key initiative to reduce costs across the entire organization and corresponding reduction in our workforce. Operating expenses associated with our water resources initiatives were $921,000 in 2016, $2,162,000 in 2015 and $2,437,000 in 2014.\nGain on sale and partial termination of timber lease in 2014 includes a $3,366,000 gain associated with partial terminations of a timber lease related to the remaining 2,700 acres of undeveloped land sold from a consolidated venture near Atlanta, Georgia.\nItems Not Allocated to Segments\nItems not allocated to segments consist of:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based and long-term incentive compensation expense\n</td> <td>(4,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>48,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(19,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>(35,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate non-operating income\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated items represent income and expenses managed on a company-wide basis and include general and administrative expenses, share-based and long-term incentive compensation, gain on sale of strategic timberland and undeveloped land, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other corporate non-operating income and expense.

In 2015, employee compensation and benefits include $3,314,000 of severance charges related to the departure of our former CEO and CFO under employment and separation agreements.\nShare-based compensation and Long-term incentive compensation expense\nOur share-based compensation expense principally fluctuates due to a portion of our awards being cash-settled and as a result are affected by changes in the market price of our common stock.\nIn 2016 and 2015, we granted $620,000 and $587,000 of long-term incentive compensation in the form of deferred cash compensation. The 2016 deferred cash awards vest annually over two years, and the 2015 deferred cash awards vest after three years. Both awards provide for accelerated vesting upon retirement, disability, death, or if there is a change in control. Expense associated with deferred cash awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nGain on sale of assets\nIn 2016, we sold over 58,300 acres of timber and timberland in Georgia and Alabama for $104,172,000 in three transactions generating combined net proceeds of $103,238,000. These transactions resulted in a combined gain on sale of assets of $48,891,000.\nInterest expense\nThe decrease in interest expense in 2016 is due to reducing our debt outstanding by $277,790,000 in 2016 and $323,303,000 since third quarter-end 2015.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt, net\nIn 2016, we retired portions of our 8.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 resulting in a net loss on debt extinguishment of $35,864,000, which includes write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5,489,000 and $1,301,000 in other costs related to tender offer advisory services.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations was 17 percent in 2016, 395 percent in 2015 and 36 percent in 2014. Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to a 19 percent benefit from a valuation allowance decrease due to a decrease in our deferred tax assets. Our 2015 effective tax rate is attributable almost entirely to a 348 percent detriment from the recording of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset.\nOur 2016, 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates include the effect of state income taxes, nondeductible items and benefits from noncontrolling interests.\nAt year-end 2016 and 2015, we have provided a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset of $73,405,000 and $97,068,000 respectively for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we have determined is more likely than not to be unrealizable.\nIn determining our valuation allowance, we assessed available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax asset. A significant piece of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, principally driven by impairments of oil and gas and real estate properties. Such evidence limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projected future taxable income.\nThe amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence, such as our projected future taxable income.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects cash flows from both continuing and discontinued operations. We operate in cyclical industries and our cash flows fluctuate accordingly. Our principal sources of cash are proceeds from the sale of real estate and timber, the cash flow from mineral resources and income producing properties, borrowings and reimbursements from utility and improvement districts. Our principal cash requirements are for the acquisition and development of real estate, either directly or indirectly through ventures, taxes, interest and compensation. Operating cash flows are affected by the timing of the payment of real estate development expenditures and the collection of proceeds from the eventual sale of the real estate, the timing of which can vary substantially depending on many factors\nincluding the size of the project, state and local permitting requirements and availability of utilities and by the timing of oil and gas leasing and production activities. Working capital varies based on a variety of factors, including the timing of sales of real estate and timber, oil and gas leasing and production activities, collection of receivables, reimbursement from utility and improvement districts and the payment of payables and expenses.\nWe regularly evaluate alternatives for managing our capital structure and liquidity profile in consideration of expected cash flows, growth and operating capital requirements and capital market conditions. We may, at any time, be considering or be in discussions with respect to the purchase or sale of our common stock, debt securities, convertible securities or a combination thereof.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from our real estate acquisition and development activities, retail undeveloped land sales, commercial and income producing properties, timber sales, income from oil and gas properties, recreational leases and reimbursements from utility and improvement districts are classified as operating cash flows.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $66,877,000. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities when compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower real estate acquisition and development expenditures of $81,179,000, proceeds of $34,748,000 from retail undeveloped land sales activity and higher lot sales from owned and consolidated ventures, including proceeds of $19,335,000 from sale of non-core community development projects.\nIn 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $35,126,000. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities year over year is primarily the result of lower residential lot sales activity, decrease in reimbursement from utilities and improvement districts and decrease in undeveloped land sales. In addition, oil and gas operating cash flows were negatively impacted as a result of 48 percent decline in realized oil and gas prices on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. However, the sale of Midtown Cedar Hill for $42,880,000 in fourth quarter 2015 generated positive operating cash flow of $42,640,000. These cash flows were partially offset by real estate development and acquisition expenditures of $107,998,000.\nIn 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $107,082,000 principally due to $66,047,000 of reimbursements from utilities and improvement districts. In addition, increased residential lot sales and undeveloped land sales activity contributed to our net cash from operations, which are partially offset by $114,694,000 of real estate development and acquisition expenditures exceeding $84,665,000 of real estate cost of sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCapital contributions to and capital distributions from unconsolidated ventures, costs incurred to acquire, develop and construct multifamily projects that will be held as commercial properties upon stabilization as investment property, business acquisitions and investment in oil and gas properties and equipment are classified as investing activities. In addition, proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, software costs and expenditures related to reforestation activities are also classified as investing activities.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $420,743,000. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities year over year is primarily due to $427,849,000 in net proceeds from the execution of our key initiative to opportunistically divest non-core assets. Non-core asset sales includes $128,764,000 from sale of Radisson Hotel & Suites, $103,238,000 from sale of over 58,300 acres of strategic timberland and undeveloped land, $77,105,000 from sale of certain oil and gas working interest properties, $59,719,000 from sale of Eleven, $25,428,000 from sale of Dillon, $14,703,000 from sale of Music Row, $13,917,000 from sale our interest in 3600 and $4,975,000 from sale of the Downtown Edge multifamily site.\nIn 2015, net cash used for investing activities was $60,328,000 principally due to our investment of $49,717,000 in oil and gas working interest properties associated with previously committed capital investments related to exploration and production operations and a net investment in unconsolidated ventures of $14,181,000. In addition, we invested $14,690,000 in property and equipment, software and reforestation, of which $5,953,000 is related to capital expenditures for the Radisson Hotel & Suites hotel in Austin, which we sold in 2016. These are partially offset by proceeds from sale of assets of $18,260,000 principally related to sale of certain oil and gas properties.\nIn 2014, net cash used for investing activities was $129,731,000 principally due to our investment of $101,145,000 in oil and gas properties and equipment associated with our exploration and production operations and purchase of our partner's interest in a 257-unit multifamily property in Austin for $20,155,000, net of cash. In addition, we invested $16,398,000 in property and equipment, software and reforestation, of which $8,780,000 is related to capital expenditures on our 413 guest room hotel in Austin and $4,981,000 is related to water production well development, and a net investment in unconsolidated ventures of $12,895,000. These are partially offset by proceeds from sale of assets of $21,962,000 principally related to sale of certain oil and gas properties in North Dakota and Oklahoma.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2016, net cash used for financing activities was $318,264,000 principally due to retirement of $225,245,000 of our 8.5% senior secured notes, $5,000,000 of our 3.75% convertible senior notes, $9,000,000 of payments related to amortizing notes associated with our tangible equity units which are paid in full and our payment in full of $39,336,000 in loans secured by Radisson Hotel & Suites and Eleven multifamily property, which we sold in 2016. In addition, we purchased 283,976 shares of common stock for $3,537,000.\nIn 2015, net cash used for financing activities was $48,483,000 principally due to our payment in full of a $24,166,000 loan secured by Midtown Cedar Hill, retirement of $19,440,000 of our 8.50% senior secured notes and $9,000,000 of payments related to amortizing notes associated with our tangible equity units.\nIn 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $469,000 principally due to net proceeds of $241,947,000 from the issuance of 8.5% senior secured notes, partially offset by debt payments of $225,481,000, of which $200,000,000 is related to retirement of the term loan associated with our senior secured credit facility, $9,450,000 is related to payments of our amortizing notes associated with our tangible equity units, $2,878,000 is related to debt outstanding for our Lantana partnerships and the remaining associated with payment of other indebtedness. In addition, we purchased 1,491,187 shares of our common stock for $24,595,000.\nReal Estate Acquisition and Development Activities\nWe secure entitlements and develop infrastructure, primarily for single family residential and mixed-use communities.\nWe categorize real estate development and acquisition expenditures as operating activities on the statement of cash flows. These development and acquisition expenditures include costs for development of residential lots and mixed-used communities.\nA summary of our real estate acquisition and development expenditures is shown below:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Liquidity\nSenior Credit Facility\nIn 2016, we reduced the revolving commitment provided by our senior secured credit facility, which matures on May 15, 2017 (with two one year extension options), from $300,000,000 to $125,000,000, none of which was drawn at year-end 2016. The revolving line of credit may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The revolving line of credit includes a $100,000,000 sublimit for letters of credit, of which $14,850,000 is outstanding at year-end 2016. Total borrowings under our senior secured credit facility (including the face amount of letters of credit) may not exceed a borrowing base formula.\nAt year-end 2016, net unused borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility is calculated as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Senior\nCredit Facility\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing base availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: borrowings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: letters of credit\n</td> <td>(14,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unused borrowing capacity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net unused borrowing capacity for the year 2016 ranged from a high of $284,426,000 to a low of $71,262,000. Certain non-core assets support the borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility so we expect our borrowing capacity to continue to be reduced as certain non-core assets are sold. This facility is used primarily to fund our operating cash needs, which fluctuate due to timing of residential and commercial real estate sales, undeveloped land sales, oil and gas leasing, exploration and production activities and mineral lease bonus payments received, timber sales, reimbursements from utility and improvement districts, payment of payables and expenses and capital expenditures.\nOur debt agreements contain financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage. At year-end 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of these agreements.\nThe following table details our compliance with the financial covenants calculated as provided in the senior secured credit facility:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year-End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Coverage Ratio (a)\n</td> <td>\u2265 2.50:1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.01\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Leverage Ratio (b)\n</td> <td>\u2264 50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible Net Worth (c)\n</td> <td>\u2265 $426.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$545.2 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Calculated as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization), plus non-cash compensation expense, plus other non-cash expenses, divided by interest expense excluding loan fees.

Total funded debt includes indebtedness for borrowed funds, secured liabilities, reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit or similar instruments, and our pro-rata share of joint venture debt outstanding. Adjusted asset value is defined as the sum of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, timberlands, high value timberlands, raw entitled lands, entitled land under development, minerals business, Credo asset value, special improvement district receipts (SIDR) reimbursements value and other real estate owned at book value without regard to any indebtedness and our pro rata share of joint ventures' book value without regard to any indebtedness.

At year-end 2016, the requirement is $426,312,000 computed as: $379,044,000 plus 85 percent of the aggregate net proceeds received by us from any equity offering, plus 75 percent of all positive net income, on a cumulative basis since third quarter-end 2015. This covenant is applied at the end of each quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> To make additional discretionary investments, acquisitions, or distributions, we must maintain available liquidity equal to 10 percent of the aggregate commitments in place. At year-end 2016 the minimum liquidity requirement was $12,500,000, compared with $332,927,000 in actual available liquidity based on the unused borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility plus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The failure to maintain such minimum liquidity does not constitute a default or event of default of our senior secured credit facility.\nDiscretionary investments in community development may be restricted in the event that the revenue/capital expenditure ratio is less than or equal to 1.0x. As of year-end 2016, the revenue/capital expenditure ratio was 2.4x. Revenue is defined as total gross revenues (excluding revenues attributed to certain oil and gas operations and multifamily properties), plus our pro rata share of the operating revenues from unconsolidated ventures. Capital expenditures are defined as consolidated development and acquisition expenditures (excluding investments related to certain oil and gas operations and multifamily properties), plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated ventures' development and acquisition expenditures.\nWe may elect to make distributions to stockholders so long as the total leverage ratio is less than 40 percent, the interest coverage ratio is greater than 3.0:1.0 and available liquidity is not less than $125,000,000, all of which were satisfied at year-end 2016. Regardless of whether the foregoing conditions are satisfied, we may make distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000,000 to be funded from up to 65% of the net proceeds from sales of multifamily properties and non-core assets, such as the Radisson Hotel & Suites in Austin, and any oil and gas properties.\n3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020\nIn 2013, we issued $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (Convertible Notes). Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually at a rate of 3.75 percent per annum and they mature on March 1, 2020. The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 40.8351 per $1,000 principal amount. The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Prior to November 1, 2019, the Convertible Notes are convertible only upon certain circumstances, and thereafter are convertible at any time prior to the close of business\non the second scheduled trading day prior to maturity. If converted, holders will receive cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion, with any excess conversion value to be settled in shares of our common stock. In 2016, we purchased $5,000,000 of Convertible Notes at 93.25% of face value in open market transactions for $4,662,500 and we allocated $4,452,000 to extinguish the debt and $211,000 to reacquire the equity component within the convertible notes based on the fair value of the debt component. We recognized a $110,000 loss on extinguishment of debt based on the difference between the fair value of the debt component prior to conversion and the carrying value of the debt component. Total loss on extinguishment of debt including write-off of debt issuance costs allocated to the repurchased notes was $183,000. The aggregate principal outstanding at year-end 2016, net of discount and unamortized financing fees, was $104,673,000.\n8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022\nIn 2014, we issued $250,000,000 aggregate principal of 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (Notes). The Notes will mature on June 1, 2022 and interest on the Notes is payable semiannually at a rate of 8.5 percent per annum in arrears. In 2016, we completed a cash tender offer for our Notes, pursuant to which we purchased $215,495,000 principal amount (representing approximately 97.6% outstanding) of the Notes. Total consideration paid was $245,604,000, which included $29,091,000 in premium at 113.5% and $1,018,000 in accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we received consent from holders of the Notes to eliminate or modify certain covenants, events of default and other provisions contained in the indenture governing the Notes, and to release the subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing the Notes. We also purchased $9,750,000 principal amount of the Notes between 99% and 99.95% of face value principal amount of the Notes in open market transactions. The 2016 tender offer and open market purchases resulted in a $35,681,000 loss on extinguishment of debt, which includes the premium paid to repurchase the Notes, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5,416,000 and $1,301,000 in other costs related to tender offer advisory services. In 2015, we purchased $19,440,000 principal amount of Notes at 97% of face value, resulting in a gain of $589,000 on the early extinguishment of the retired Notes, offset by the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $506,000 allocated to the retired Notes. The aggregate principal outstanding at year-end 2016, net of unamortized financing fees, was $5,200,000.\n6.00% Tangible Equity Units\nIn 2013, we issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% tangible equity units (Units). The total offering was 6,000,000 Units, including 600,000 exercised by the underwriters, each with a stated amount of $25.00. Each Unit is comprised of (i) a prepaid stock purchase contract to be settled by delivery of a number of shares of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, to be determined pursuant to a purchase contract agreement, and (ii) a senior amortizing note due December 15, 2016 that has an initial principal amount of $4.2522, bears interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum and has a final installment payment date of December 15, 2016. On December 15, 2016, we made the final installment payment of principal and accrued interest and issued 7,857,000 shares upon settlement of the stock purchase contract based on the applicable market value, as defined in the purchase contract agreement associated with issuance of the Units.\nOther Notes\nIn 2016, a secured promissory note of $15,400,000 was paid in full in connection with sale of the Radisson Hotel & Suites, a 413 guest room hotel located in Austin, for $130,000,000.\nIn 2016, other indebtedness decreased principally as result of selling Eleven, a 257-unit multifamily project in Austin, for $60,150,000 and paying in full the associated debt of $23,936,000.\nContractual Obligations\nAt year-end 2016, contractual obligations consist of:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due or Expiring by Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt (a) (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance bond (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letter of credit (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Items included in our balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Gross debt excluding unamortized discount and financing fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Interest payments on debt include interest payments related to our fixed rate debt and estimated interest payments related to our variable rate debt.

Our purchase obligations include open commitments for land acquisition and development related to community development projects.\nOur operating leases are for facilities, equipment and groundwater. We lease approximately 22,000 square feet of office space in Austin as our corporate headquarters. At year-end 2016, the remaining contractual obligation for our Austin office is $1,983,000. We also lease office space in other locations in support of our business operations. The total remaining contractual obligations for these leases is $1,925,000.

The outstanding balance was $44,446,000 at year-end 2016. We provided the lender with a guaranty of completion of the improvements; a guaranty for repayment of 25 percent of the principal balance and unpaid accrued interest; and a standard nonrecourse carve-out guaranty. The principal guaranty will reduce from 25 percent of principal to ten percent upon achievement of certain conditions.\nIn 2014, CREA FMF Nashville LLC, an equity method venture in which we own a 30 percent interest, obtained a senior secured construction loan in the amount of $51,950,000 to develop a 320-unit multifamily project located in Nashville, Tennessee. The outstanding balance at year-end 2016 was $37,446,000. We provided the lender with a guaranty of completion of the improvements; a guaranty for repayment of 25 percent of the principal balance and unpaid accrued interest; and a standard nonrecourse carve-out guaranty. The principal guaranty will reduce from 25 percent of principal to zero percent\nupon achievement of certain conditions.\nCibolo Canyons - San Antonio, Texas\nCibolo Canyons consists of the JW Marriott\u00ae San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa development owned by third parties and a mixed-use development we own. We have about $44,905,000 invested in Cibolo Canyons at year-end 2016, all of which is related to the mixed-use development.\nMixed-Use Development\nThe mixed-use development we own consists of 2,100 acres planned to include 1,791 residential lots and 155 commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses, of which 1,142 lots and 97 commercial acres have been sold through year-end 2016.\nIn 2007, we entered into an agreement with CCSID providing for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed-use development. Reimbursements are subject to review and approval by CCSID and unreimbursed amounts accrue interest at 9.75 percent. CCSID's funding for reimbursements is principally derived from its ad valorem tax collections and bond proceeds collateralized by ad valorem taxes, less debt service on these bonds and annual administrative and public service expenses.\nBecause the amount of each reimbursement is dependent on several factors, including timing of CCSID approval and CCSID having an adequate tax base to generate funds that can be used to reimburse us, there is uncertainty as to the amount and timing of reimbursements under this agreement. We expect to recover our investment from lot and tract sales and reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs from CCSID. We have not recognized income from interest due, but not collected. As these uncertainties are clarified, we will modify our accounting accordingly.\nThrough year-end 2016, we have submitted reimbursement approval for $54,376,000 of infrastructure costs, of which we have received reimbursements totaling $45,132,000, of which $10,430,000 was received in 2016. At year-end 2016, we have $9,244,000 in pending approved reimbursements, excluding interest.\nResort Hotel, Spa and Golf Development\nIn 2007, we entered into agreements to facilitate third-party construction and ownership of the JW Marriott\u00ae San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa, which includes a 1,002 room destination resort and two PGA Tour\u00ae Tournament Players Club\u00ae (TPC) golf courses.\nIn exchange for our commitment to the resort, the third-party owners assigned to us certain rights under an agreement between the third-party owners and CCSID. This agreement includes the right to receive from CCSID nine percent of hotel occupancy revenues and 1.5 percent of other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the CCSID through 2034. The amount we receive will be net of annual ad valorem tax reimbursements by CCSID to the third-party owners of the resort through 2020. In addition, these payments will be net of debt service on bonds issued by CCSID collateralized by hotel occupancy tax (HOT) and other resort sales tax through 2034. The amounts we collect under this agreement are dependent on several factors including the amount of revenues generated by and ad valorem taxes imposed on the Resort and the amount of any applicable debt service incurred by CCSID. The amount we receive is net of annual ad valorem tax reimbursements by CCSID to the third-party owners of the resort through 2020. In addition, these payments will be net of debt service on bonds issued in 2014 by CCSID as discussed below which are collateralized by hotel occupancy tax (HOT) and other resort sales tax through 2034.\nIn 2014, we received $50,550,000 from CCSID under 2007 Economic Development Agreements (EDA) related to its issuance of $48,900,000 HOT and Sales and Use Tax Revenue Bonds, resulting in recovery of our full Resort investment. These bonds are obligations solely of CCSID and are payable from HOT and sales and use taxes levied on the Resort by CCSID. To facilitate the issuance of the bonds, we provided a $6,846,000 letter of credit to the bond trustee as security for certain debt service fund obligations in the event CCSID tax collections are not sufficient to support payment of the bonds in accordance with their terms. The letter of credit must be maintained until the earlier of redemption of the bonds or scheduled bond maturity in 2034. We also entered into an agreement with the owner of the Resort to assign its senior rights to us in exchange for consideration provided by us, including a surety bond to be drawn if CCSID tax collections are not sufficient to support ad valorem tax rebates payable. The surety bond has a balance of $6,631,000 at year-end 2016. The surety bond decreases as CCSID makes annual ad valorem tax rebate payments, which obligation is scheduled to be retired in full by 2020. All future receipts are expected to be recognized as gains in the period collected. We received $501,000 in 2016.\nAccounting Policies\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements, we follow generally accepted accounting principles, which in many cases require us to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Many of these principles are relatively straightforward. There are, however, a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results of operations and involve significant assumptions, estimates and judgments that are difficult to determine. We must make these assumptions, estimates and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as future economic conditions, operating results and valuations, as well as our intentions. As the difficulty increases, the level of precision decreases, meaning actual results can, and probably will, differ from those currently estimated. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable. We have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our Audit Committee.\nAt year-end 2016, we have divested substantially all of our oil and gas working interest assets and have classified our owned mineral assets as assets held for sale. Critical accounting estimates related to oil and gas properties such as accrued oil and gas revenue, impairment of oil and gas properties, oil and gas reserves and asset retirement obligations are not material to our financial statements for year-end 2016 but are disclosed to provide our policies and impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended 2015 and 2014.\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment in Real Estate and Cost of Real Estate Sales - In allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold, we must estimate current and future real estate values. Our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods 15 to 20 years from today and are dependent on numerous assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions. In addition, when we sell real estate from projects that are\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nnot finished, we must estimate future development costs through completion. Differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of Real Estate Long-Lived Assets - Measuring real estate assets for impairment requires estimating the future undiscounted cash flows based on our intentions as to holding periods, and the residual value of assets under review, primarily undeveloped land. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the real estate long-lived assets to fair value. Depending on the asset under review, we use varying methods to determine fair value, such as discounting expected future cash flows, determining resale values by market, or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market. Changes in economic conditions, demand for real estate, and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accrued Oil and Gas Revenue - We recognize revenue as oil and gas is produced and sold. There are a significant amount of oil and gas properties which we do not operate and, therefore, revenue is typically recorded in the month of production based on an estimate of our share of volumes produced and prices realized. We obtain the most current available production data from the operators and price indices for each well to estimate the accrual of revenue. Obtaining production data on a timely basis for some wells is not feasible; therefore we utilize past production receipts and estimated sales price information to estimate accrual of working interest revenue on all other non-operated wells each month. Revisions to such estimates are recorded as actual results become known.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties - We review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures, and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment. We assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage. Due to the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Oil and Gas Reserves - The estimation of oil and gas reserves is a significant estimate which affects the amount of non-cash depletion expense we record as well as impairment analysis we perform. On an annual basis, we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to assist us in preparing estimates of oil and gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data, reservoir pressure data, core analysis reports, well logs, analogous reservoir performance history, production data and other available sources of engineering, geological and geophysical information. Oil and gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide or domestic production and consumption and are outside our control.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asset Retirement Obligations - We make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties. Estimating future costs involves significant assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as estimated costs of plugging and abandonment, timing of settlements, discount rates and inflation rates. Such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of Goodwill - Measuring goodwill for impairment annually requires estimation of future cash flows and determination of fair values using many assumptions and inputs, including estimated future selling prices and volumes, estimated future costs to develop and explore, observable market inputs, weighted average cost of capital, estimated operating expenses and various other projected economic factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in the future periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Share-Based Compensation - We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\noption exercise behaviors (term of option), risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards. The expected stock price volatility was determined using a blend of historical and implied volatility. Pre-vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity and historical trends. We use Monte Carlo simulation pricing model to determine the fair value of market-leveraged stock units (MSU's) and stock option awards with market condition. A typical Monte Carlo exercise simulates a distribution of stock prices to yield an expected distribution of stock prices at the end of the performance period. The simulations are repeated many times in order to derive a probabilistic assessment of stock performance. The stock-paths are simulated using assumptions which include expected stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Taxes - In preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant judgment is required to estimate our income taxes. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws. We estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. If needed, we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In addition, when we believe a tax position is supportable but the outcome uncertain, we include the item in our tax return but do not recognize the related benefit in our provision for taxes. Instead, we record a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our expectation of the most likely outcome considering the technical merits and specific facts of the position. Changes to liabilities are only made when an event occurs that changes the most likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in tax law, or recent court rulings. Adjustments to temporary differences, permanent differences or uncertain tax positions could materially impact our financial position, cash flow and results of operation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease read Note 2 - New and Pending Accounting Pronouncements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business. We believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses, and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position, long-term results of operations, or cash flow. It is possible, however, that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and results of operations, outlining various factors and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and other materials we have filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d could,\u201d estimate,\u201d likely,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d expect,\u201d and similar expressions, including references to assumptions. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risk and uncertainties. We note that a variety of factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors and uncertainties that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 general economic, market or business conditions in Texas or Georgia, where our real estate activities are concentrated, or on a national or global scale; \n \u2022 our ability to achieve some or all of our key initiatives; \n \u2022 the opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to us and that we may pursue; \n \u2022 our ability to hire and retain key personnel; \n \u2022 future residential or commercial entitlements, development approvals and the ability to obtain such approvals; \n \u2022 obtaining approvals of reimbursements and other payments from special improvement districts and timing of such payments; \n \u2022 accuracy of estimates and other assumptions related to investment in and development of real estate, the expected timing and pricing of land and lot sales and related cost of real estate sales, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, share-based compensation; \n \u2022 the levels of resale housing inventory in our mixed-use development projects and the regions in which they are located; \n \u2022 fluctuations in costs and expenses, including impacts from shortages in materials or labor; \n \u2022 demand for new housing, which can be affected by a number of factors including the availability of mortgage credit, job growth, fluctuations in commodity prices; \n \u2022 demand for multifamily communities, which can be affected by a number of factors including local markets and economic conditions; \n \u2022 competitive actions by other companies; \n \u2022 changes in governmental policies, laws or regulations and actions or restrictions of regulatory agencies; \n \u2022 fluctuations in oil and gas commodity prices; \n \u2022 demand by oil and gas operators to lease our minerals, which may be influenced by government regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing; \n \u2022 our ability to make interest and principal payments on our debt and satisfy the other covenants contained in our senior secured credit facility, indentures and other debt agreements; \n \u2022 our partners' ability to fund their capital commitments and otherwise fulfill their operating and financial obligations; \n \u2022 inability to obtain permits for, or changes in laws, governmental policies or regulations affecting, water withdrawal or usage; and \n \u2022 the final resolutions or outcomes with respect to our contingent and other liabilities related to our business.  Other factors, including the risk factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by our forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, nor can we assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nKey Initiatives\n \u2022 Reducing costs across our entire organization, \n \u2022 Reviewing entire portfolio of assets (complete non-core asset sales); and \n \u2022 Reviewing capital structure (allocate capital to maximize shareholder value).  Discontinued Operations / Segment Name Changes\nAt year-end 2016 we have divested substantially all of our oil and gas working interest properties. As a result of this significant change in our operations, we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these assets as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, we changed the name of the oil and gas segment to mineral resources to reflect the strategic shift from oil and gas working interest investments to owned mineral interests. We also changed the name of the other natural resources segment to other. The discussion of our results of operations is based on the results from our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended 2016, 2015 and 2014\nA summary of our consolidated results by business segment follows:\n\nSignificant aspects of our results of operations follow:\n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings benefited from combined gains of $117,856,000 which generated combined net proceeds before debt repayment of $247,506,000 as a result of executing our key initiative to opportunistically divest non-core assets. These gains were partially offset by non-cash impairment charges of $56,453,000 related to six non-core community development projects and two multifamily sites. These impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings consideration, to market these properties for sale. In addition, earnings benefited from increased residential lot sales activity and higher undeveloped land sales from our retail sales program. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased due to lower oil and gas prices and production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings was negatively impacted due to a $3,874,000 non-cash impairment charge of goodwill related to our central Texas water assets as a result of entering into an agreement to sell these assets. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense decreased as result of our key initiative to reduce costs across our entire organization. \n \u2022 Gain on sale of assets of $48,891,000 represents the sale of over 58,300 acres of timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and Alabama in three separate transactions for $104,172,000 in accordance with our key initiative to divest non-core assets. \n \u2022 Interest expense decreased primarily due to reducing our debt outstanding by $277,790,000 in 2016 and $323,303,000 since third quarter 2015. \n \u2022 Loss on extinguishment of debt of $35,864,000 is related to debt retirement of portions of our 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, which includes write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5,489,000 and $1,301,000 in other costs related to tender offer advisory services. \n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings declined principally due to gain on sale of assets of $25,981,000 in 2014 compared with $1,585,000 in 2015, lower undeveloped land sales and decreased residential lot sales activity. Segment earnings were positively impacted by higher commercial and residential tract sales and sale of Midtown Cedar Hill, a 354-unit multifamily property near Dallas for $42,880,000, which generated segment earnings of $9,265,000. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased principally due to lower oil prices, as well as lower oil and gas production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings declined principally due to gains of $3,531,000 in 2014 related to partial terminations of a timber lease related to land sold from a consolidated venture near Atlanta, Georgia and due to lower fiber volumes. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased principally as a result of severance-related charges of $3,314,000 related to departures of our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). \n \u2022 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and increased average debt outstanding. \n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings benefited from increased undeveloped land sales generating earnings of $29,895,000, a $10,476,000 gain associated with a non-monetary exchange of leasehold timber rights for 5,400 acres of undeveloped land with a partner in a consolidated venture, a $7,610,000 gain associated with the acquisition of our partner's interest in the Eleven multifamily venture, higher residential lot sales activity and a $6,577,000 gain associated with $46,500,000 of bond proceeds we received from the Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased principally due to lower oil and gas production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings declined principally due to lower fiber volumes, which were partially offset by gains of $3,531,000 primarily related to partial terminations of a timber lease related to land sold from a consolidated venture near Atlanta, Georgia. \n \u2022 Share-based compensation decreased principally as result of a 28% decrease in our stock price since year-end 2013 and its impact on cash-settled awards. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and increased debt outstanding.  Current Market Conditions\nSales of new U.S. single-family homes according to U.S Census Bureau Department of Commerce declined 0.4% on a year over year basis as of December 31, 2016 and 10.4% below prior month's rate in December 2016, suggesting that the 40 basis point rise in mortgage rates and the return of winter weather affected December 2016 sales. Consumer confidence as measured by The Conference Board increased in December 2016 to its highest level since August 2001, registering 113.7 up from 109.4 in November 2016. The elevated monthly reading was attributed in part to increases in consumers' outlook for business conditions over the next six-months and more positive outlooks for the labor market and rising incomes. Builder confidence as measured by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index ended 2016 on a high note, jumping seven points to its highest reading since July 2005, largely attributable to a post-election bounce. On a monthly basis, housing starts increased significantly in December 2016 due to volatile multifamily activity, while housing permit activity, viewed as a precursor to starts increased 1.9% year over year basis ending December 2016. Home prices as measured by S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price index hit a new high in November 2016 after rising at approximately a 5.5% annual rate over the last two-and-a half years. As of the November 2016 reading, average home prices for the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the two composite indices were back to their winter 2007 levels. As of year-end 2016, finished vacant supply of new homes and vacant developed lot supply in MSAs in which Forestar's single family activity is located remained extremely tight, registering below the two month and 24 month equilibrium levels.\nOil and gas revenues are influenced by prices of, and global and domestic supply and demand for, oil and gas. These commodities as determined by both regional and global markets depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, the condition of the domestic and global economies, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, supply and demand for oil and gas and the effects of federal, state and local regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 as compared with the first half in 2015. Prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices averaged $43.33 per Bbl in 2016, nearly 11% lower than in 2015 and $48.66 per Bbl in 2015, nearly 48% lower than in 2014.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our operations through three business segments:\n \u2022 Real estate, \n \u2022 Mineral resources, and \n \u2022 Other.  We evaluate performance based on segment earnings (loss) before unallocated items and income taxes. Segment earnings (loss) consist of operating income (loss), equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures', gain on sale of assets, interest income on loans secured by real estate and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Items not allocated to our business segments consist of general and administrative expenses, share-based and long-term compensation, gain on sale of strategic timberland and undeveloped land, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other corporate non-operating income and expense. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the accounting policy note to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe operate in cyclical industries. Our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates, availability of mortgage credit, consumer and home builder sentiment, new housing starts, real estate values, employment levels, changes in the market prices for oil, gas and timber, and the overall strength or weakness of the U.S. economy.\nReal Estate\nWe own directly or through ventures interests in 50 residential and mixed-use projects comprised of approximately 4,600 acres of real estate located in 10 states and 14 markets. Our real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on our lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities. We own approximately 11,000 acres of non-core timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and approximately 8,000 acres in Texas. We own and manage our projects either directly or through ventures. Our real estate segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of residential single-family lots and tracts, undeveloped land and commercial real estate, and in 2014 and 2015 from the operation of several income producing properties, primarily a hotel and multifamily properties.\nA summary of our real estate results follows:\n\nRevenues in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of:\n\nResidential real estate revenues principally consist of the sale of single-family lots to local, regional and national home builders. In 2016, residential real estate revenues increased primarily due to higher lot sales activity but were partially offset by lower average sale prices per lot as a result of selling 235 bulk lots from four non-core community development projects. Excluding these non-core sales, we sold 1,427 lots from our owned and consolidated projects at an average price of $71,300 per lot. In addition, in 2016, we sold 1,539 residential tract acres for $8,728,000 generating earnings of $847,000. In 2015, residential real estate revenues decreased primarily due to lower lot sales activity due to construction and inspection delays associated with abnormally wet weather conditions. Also, in 2015, we sold 1,062 residential tract acres for $11,223,000 generating earnings of $5,489,000, compared with 936 acres of residential tracts for $7,996,000 generating earnings of $2,988,000 in 2014.\nThe timing of commercial real estate revenues can vary depending on the demand, mix, project life-cycle, size and location of the project. In 2016, the increase in commercial real estate revenues is primarily due to selling 286 commercial acres from four non-core community development projects, of which 264 acres were sold from our San Joaquin River project in Antioch, California for $7,330,000 which provided approximately $37,400,000 in income tax losses to offset tax gains from other sales. In 2015, our commercial tract sales revenue increased principally due to higher average sales price of tracts sold. In 2015, we sold 31 commercial acres for $5,542,000 from our owned and consolidated projects, generating earnings of $3,345,000, compared with 21 commercial acres for $1,889,000, generating earnings of $444,000 in 2014.\nUndeveloped land revenues represent land sold from our retail sales program. In 2016, we sold 14,438 acres of undeveloped land for $2,485 per acre, generating approximately $28,098,000 in earnings. In 2015, we sold 9,645 acres of undeveloped land for $2,369 per acre, generating approximately $16,542,000 in earnings, compared with 21,345 acres sold for $2,181 per acre, generating earnings of $29,895,000 in 2014.\nCommercial and income producing properties revenues include revenues from sale of multifamily properties which we developed as a merchant builder and operate until sold, from hotel room sales and other guest services, rental revenues from our operating multifamily properties and reimbursement for costs paid to subcontractors plus development and construction fees from certain multifamily projects. In 2016, commercial and income producing properties revenues decreased as result of selling the Radisson Hotel & Suites, a 413 guest room hotel located in Austin, in second quarter 2016 and Eleven, a multifamily property in Austin, in first quarter 2016, and the impact of selling Midtown Cedar Hill, a multifamily property near Dallas in fourth quarter 2015 for $42,880,000. Commercial and income producing properties revenue in 2015 includes $6,238,000 in construction revenues associated with one multifamily fixed fee contract as general contractor which was substantially completed at year-end 2015, compared with $12,282,000 in 2014. The decrease in construction revenues in 2015 is primarily due to the completion of the Eleven project in second quarter 2014. In 2015, rental revenues from our multifamily operating properties were $8,380,000 compared with $1,550,000 in 2014, primarily due to the substantial completion of the Eleven multifamily project at the end of second quarter 2014 and acquiring our partner's interest in the multifamily venture in third quarter 2014.\nOther revenues primarily result from sale of stream and impervious cover credits. In 2016, we sold 24 acres of impervious cover credits to home builders for $3,232,000, generating earnings of $2,787,000 and 138,000 mitigation banking credits for $3,265,000, generating earnings of $2,137,000.\nUnits sold consist of:\n\nCost of sales in 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $56,453,000 associated with six non-core community development projects and two multifamily sites, of which four non-core community development projects and one multifamily site were sold in 2016 and one multifamily site was under contract to be sold at year-end 2016 and is expected to close in 2017. The non-cash impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings considerations, to market these properties for sale. In 2015, cost of sales includes $7,781,000 related to multifamily construction contracts we incurred as general contractor and paid to subcontractors associated with our development of a multifamily venture property near Denver compared to $17,393,000 in 2014, associated with two multifamily venture properties. Included in multifamily construction contract costs are charges of $1,531,000 in 2015 reflecting estimated cost increases associated with our fixed fee contracts as general contractor for these two multifamily venture properties compared to $5,107,000 in 2014. Cost of sales in 2015 includes $33,375,000 in carrying value related to Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily property we developed as a merchant builder and sold. In addition, cost of sales includes non-cash impairment charges of $1,044,000 in 2015 and $399,000 in 2014.\nOperating expenses consist of:\n\nThe decrease in operating expenses for 2016 is principally related to decrease in depreciation and amortization and property taxes associated with first quarter 2016 sale of Eleven multifamily project and fourth quarter 2015 sale of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project. The increase in operating expenses for 2015 when compared with 2014 was primarily due to increase in depreciation and amortization associated with the acquisition of Eleven multifamily project in which we previously held a 25 percent equity interest and completion of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project in 2015.\nInterest income principally represents interest received on reimbursements from utility and improvement districts. Interest income in year 2014 principally represents earnings from a loan secured by a mixed-use real estate community in Houston that was paid in full in first quarter 2015.\nIn 2016, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $95,336,000 related to sale of Radisson Hotel & Suites, a gain of $9,116,000 related to sale of Eleven, a gain of $1,223,000 associated with sale of Dillon, a gain of $10,363,000 related to sale of our interest in 3600,, a gain of $3,968,000 associated with sale of Music Row, a loss of $3,870,000 related to selling the Downtown Edge multifamily site, a gain of $1,219,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond supporting the 2014 Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) bond offering and $501,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax revenues from CCSID. The surety bond has a balance of $6,631,000 at year-end 2016. The surety bond will decrease as CCSID makes annual ad valorem tax rebate payments to San Antonio Real Estate (SARE) owner of the Resort, which obligation is scheduled to be retired in full by 2020.\nIn 2015, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $1,160,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond in connection with the CCSID bond offering in 2014 and $425,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax pledged revenues from CCSID after their payments to the debt service fund.\nIn 2014, gain on sale of assets principally includes a gain of $10,476,000 associated with a non-monetary exchange of leasehold timber rights on approximately 10,300 acres for 5,400 acres of undeveloped land with a partner in a consolidated venture, a gain of $7,610,000 related to acquiring our partner's interest in the Eleven multifamily venture, a gain of $6,577,000 related to bond proceeds received from Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) at our Cibolo Canyons project near San Antonio, and a gain of $1,318,000 associated with the sale of a land purchase option contract.\nDecreases in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower residential, commercial and undeveloped sales activity. Increase in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to increased lot sales activity associated with two projects in Houston and increased undeveloped land sales from a venture in Atlanta.\nWe underwrite real estate development projects based on a variety of assumptions incorporated into our development plans, including the timing and pricing of sales and leasing and costs to complete development. Our development plans are periodically reviewed in comparison to our return projections and expectations, and we may revise our plans as business conditions warrant. If as a result of changes to our development plans the anticipated future net cash flows are reduced such that our basis in a project is not fully recoverable, we may be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge for such project. See Part I, Item 1. Business for information about our net investment in owned and consolidated real estate by geographic location at year-end 2016.\nMineral resources\nIn 2016, we determined that our owned mineral assets were non-core and that we would explore opportunistically divesting these assets.\nAt year-end 2016, we classified our non-core mineral assets as held for sale. On February 17, 2017, we sold substantially all of our remaining oil and gas assets for a total purchase price of $85,600,000, of which $75,000,000 was received at closing. The balance of the purchase price is being held in a third-party escrow account pending completion of (a) title review, and (b) transfer of certain mineral interests owned by a venture in which the Company is a member. In first quarter 2017, we expect to recognize a gain on sale of approximately $82,400,000, of which $10,600,000 will be deferred until verification of accepted title for non-producing fee minerals in Texas", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and other materials we have filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Discontinued Operations / Segment Name Changes\nAt year-end 2016 we have divested substantially all of our oil and gas working interest properties. As a result of this significant change in our operations, we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these assets as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, we changed the name of the oil and gas segment to mineral resources to reflect the strategic shift from oil and gas working interest investments to owned mineral interests. We also changed the name of the other natural resources segment to other. The discussion of our results of operations is based on the results from our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended 2016, 2015 and 2014\nA summary of our consolidated results by business segment follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral resources\n</td> <td>5,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral resources\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(4,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>120,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items not allocated to segments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>(18,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based and long-term incentive compensation expense\n</td> <td>(4,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>48,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(19,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>(35,864\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate non-operating income\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before taxes attributable to Forestar Group Inc.\n</td> <td>90,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(15,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Forestar Group Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant aspects of our results of operations follow:\n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings benefited from combined gains of $117,856,000 which generated combined net proceeds before debt repayment of $247,506,000 as a result of executing our key initiative to opportunistically divest non-core assets. These gains were partially offset by non-cash impairment charges of $56,453,000 related to six non-core community development projects and two multifamily sites. These impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings consideration, to market these properties for sale. In addition, earnings benefited from increased residential lot sales activity and higher undeveloped land sales from our retail sales program. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased due to lower oil and gas prices and production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings was negatively impacted due to a $3,874,000 non-cash impairment charge of goodwill related to our central Texas water assets as a result of entering into an agreement to sell these assets. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense decreased as result of our key initiative to reduce costs across our entire organization. \n \u2022 Gain on sale of assets of $48,891,000 represents the sale of over 58,300 acres of timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and Alabama in three separate transactions for $104,172,000 in accordance with our key initiative to divest non-core assets. \n \u2022 Interest expense decreased primarily due to reducing our debt outstanding by $277,790,000 in 2016 and $323,303,000 since third quarter 2015. \n \u2022 Loss on extinguishment of debt of $35,864,000 is related to debt retirement of portions of our 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, which includes write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5,489,000 and $1,301,000 in other costs related to tender offer advisory services. \n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings declined principally due to gain on sale of assets of $25,981,000 in 2014 compared with $1,585,000 in 2015, lower undeveloped land sales and decreased residential lot sales activity. Segment earnings were positively impacted by higher commercial and residential tract sales and sale of Midtown Cedar Hill, a 354-unit multifamily property near Dallas for $42,880,000, which generated segment earnings of $9,265,000. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased principally due to lower oil prices, as well as lower oil and gas production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings declined principally due to gains of $3,531,000 in 2014 related to partial terminations of a timber lease related to land sold from a consolidated venture near Atlanta, Georgia and due to lower fiber volumes. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense increased principally as a result of severance-related charges of $3,314,000 related to departures of our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). \n \u2022 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and increased average debt outstanding. \n \u2022 Real estate segment earnings benefited from increased undeveloped land sales generating earnings of $29,895,000, a $10,476,000 gain associated with a non-monetary exchange of leasehold timber rights for 5,400 acres of undeveloped land with a partner in a consolidated venture, a $7,610,000 gain associated with the acquisition of our partner's interest in the Eleven multifamily venture, higher residential lot sales activity and a $6,577,000 gain associated with $46,500,000 of bond proceeds we received from the Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District. \n \u2022 Mineral resources segment earnings decreased principally due to lower oil and gas production volumes associated with royalty interests and reduced lease bonus and delay rental payments received from our owned mineral interests. \n \u2022 Other segment earnings declined principally due to lower fiber volumes, which were partially offset by gains of $3,531,000 primarily related to partial terminations of a timber lease related to land sold from a consolidated venture near Atlanta, Georgia. \n \u2022 Share-based compensation decreased principally as result of a 28% decrease in our stock price since year-end 2013 and its impact on cash-settled awards. \n \u2022 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average borrowing rates and increased debt outstanding.  Current Market Conditions\nSales of new U.S. single-family homes according to U.S Census Bureau Department of Commerce declined 0.4% on a year over year basis as of December 31, 2016 and 10.4% below prior month's rate in December 2016, suggesting that the 40 basis point rise in mortgage rates and the return of winter weather affected December 2016 sales. Consumer confidence as measured by The Conference Board increased in December 2016 to its highest level since August 2001, registering 113.7 up from 109.4 in November 2016. The elevated monthly reading was attributed in part to increases in consumers' outlook for business conditions over the next six-months and more positive outlooks for the labor market and rising incomes. Builder confidence as measured by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index ended 2016 on a high note, jumping seven points to its highest reading since July 2005, largely attributable to a post-election bounce. On a monthly basis, housing starts increased significantly in December 2016 due to volatile multifamily activity, while housing permit activity, viewed as a precursor to starts increased 1.9% year over year basis ending December 2016. Home prices as measured by S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price index hit a new high in November 2016 after rising at approximately a 5.5% annual rate over the last two-and-a half years. As of the November 2016 reading, average home prices for the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the two composite indices were back to their winter 2007 levels. As of year-end 2016, finished vacant supply of new homes and vacant developed lot supply in MSAs in which Forestar's single family activity is located remained extremely tight, registering below the two month and 24 month equilibrium levels.\nOil and gas revenues are influenced by prices of, and global and domestic supply and demand for, oil and gas. These commodities as determined by both regional and global markets depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, the condition of the domestic and global economies, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, supply and demand for oil and gas and the effects of federal, state and local regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price of crude oil decreased during the first half of 2016 as compared with the first half in 2015. Prices increased during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and inventories declined in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016. Natural gas prices decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to domestic oversupply driven by lack of a normal winter withdrawal cycle in the winter of 2015-2016. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices averaged $43.33 per Bbl in 2016, nearly 11% lower than in 2015 and $48.66 per Bbl in 2015, nearly 48% lower than in 2014.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage our operations through three business segments:\n \u2022 Real estate, \n \u2022 Mineral resources, and \n \u2022 Other.  We evaluate performance based on segment earnings (loss) before unallocated items and income taxes. Segment earnings (loss) consist of operating income (loss), equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures', gain on sale of assets, interest income on loans secured by real estate and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Items not allocated to our business segments consist of general and administrative expenses, share-based and long-term compensation, gain on sale of strategic timberland and undeveloped land, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other corporate non-operating income and expense. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the accounting policy note to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe operate in cyclical industries. Our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates, availability of mortgage credit, consumer and home builder sentiment, new housing starts, real estate values, employment levels, changes in the market prices for oil, gas and timber, and the overall strength or weakness of the U.S. economy.\nReal Estate\nWe own directly or through ventures interests in 50 residential and mixed-use projects comprised of approximately 4,600 acres of real estate located in 10 states and 14 markets. Our real estate segment secures entitlements and develops infrastructure on our lands, primarily for single-family residential and mixed-use communities. We own approximately 11,000 acres of non-core timberland and undeveloped land in Georgia and approximately 8,000 acres in Texas. We own and manage our projects either directly or through ventures. Our real estate segment revenues are principally derived from the sales of residential single-family lots and tracts, undeveloped land and commercial real estate, and in 2014 and 2015 from the operation of several income producing properties, primarily a hotel and multifamily properties.\nA summary of our real estate results follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>(163,095\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>(29,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(2,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on loan secured by real estate\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>117,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(1,531\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>11,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped land\n</td> <td>35,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and income producing properties\n</td> <td>13,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential real estate revenues principally consist of the sale of single-family lots to local, regional and national home builders. In 2016, residential real estate revenues increased primarily due to higher lot sales activity but were partially offset by lower average sale prices per lot as a result of selling 235 bulk lots from four non-core community development projects. Excluding these non-core sales, we sold 1,427 lots from our owned and consolidated projects at an average price of $71,300 per lot. In addition, in 2016, we sold 1,539 residential tract acres for $8,728,000 generating earnings of $847,000. In 2015, residential real estate revenues decreased primarily due to lower lot sales activity due to construction and inspection delays associated with abnormally wet weather conditions. Also, in 2015, we sold 1,062 residential tract acres for $11,223,000 generating earnings of $5,489,000, compared with 936 acres of residential tracts for $7,996,000 generating earnings of $2,988,000 in 2014.\nThe timing of commercial real estate revenues can vary depending on the demand, mix, project life-cycle, size and location of the project. In 2016, the increase in commercial real estate revenues is primarily due to selling 286 commercial acres from four non-core community development projects, of which 264 acres were sold from our San Joaquin River project in Antioch, California for $7,330,000 which provided approximately $37,400,000 in income tax losses to offset tax gains from other sales. In 2015, our commercial tract sales revenue increased principally due to higher average sales price of tracts sold. In 2015, we sold 31 commercial acres for $5,542,000 from our owned and consolidated projects, generating earnings of $3,345,000, compared with 21 commercial acres for $1,889,000, generating earnings of $444,000 in 2014.\nUndeveloped land revenues represent land sold from our retail sales program. In 2016, we sold 14,438 acres of undeveloped land for $2,485 per acre, generating approximately $28,098,000 in earnings. In 2015, we sold 9,645 acres of undeveloped land for $2,369 per acre, generating approximately $16,542,000 in earnings, compared with 21,345 acres sold for $2,181 per acre, generating earnings of $29,895,000 in 2014.\nCommercial and income producing properties revenues include revenues from sale of multifamily properties which we developed as a merchant builder and operate until sold, from hotel room sales and other guest services, rental revenues from our operating multifamily properties and reimbursement for costs paid to subcontractors plus development and construction fees from certain multifamily projects. In 2016, commercial and income producing properties revenues decreased as result of selling the Radisson Hotel & Suites, a 413 guest room hotel located in Austin, in second quarter 2016 and Eleven, a multifamily property in Austin, in first quarter 2016, and the impact of selling Midtown Cedar Hill, a multifamily property near Dallas in fourth quarter 2015 for $42,880,000. Commercial and income producing properties revenue in 2015 includes $6,238,000 in construction revenues associated with one multifamily fixed fee contract as general contractor which was substantially completed at year-end 2015, compared with $12,282,000 in 2014. The decrease in construction revenues in 2015 is primarily due to the completion of the Eleven project in second quarter 2014. In 2015, rental revenues from our multifamily operating properties were $8,380,000 compared with $1,550,000 in 2014, primarily due to the substantial completion of the Eleven multifamily project at the end of second quarter 2014 and acquiring our partner's interest in the multifamily venture in third quarter 2014.\nOther revenues primarily result from sale of stream and impervious cover credits. In 2016, we sold 24 acres of impervious cover credits to home builders for $3,232,000, generating earnings of $2,787,000 and 138,000 mitigation banking credits for $3,265,000, generating earnings of $2,137,000.\nUnits sold consist of:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned and consolidated ventures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential lots sold\n</td> <td>1,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per lot sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial acres sold\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per commercial acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped acres sold\n</td> <td>14,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ventures accounted for using the equity method:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential lots sold\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per lot sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial acres sold\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per commercial acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>589,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undeveloped acres sold\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per acre sold\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales in 2016 included non-cash impairment charges of $56,453,000 associated with six non-core community development projects and two multifamily sites, of which four non-core community development projects and one multifamily site were sold in 2016 and one multifamily site was under contract to be sold at year-end 2016 and is expected to close in 2017. The non-cash impairments were a result of our key initiative to review our entire portfolio of assets which resulted in business plan changes, inclusive of cash tax savings considerations, to market these properties for sale. In 2015, cost of sales includes $7,781,000 related to multifamily construction contracts we incurred as general contractor and paid to subcontractors associated with our development of a multifamily venture property near Denver compared to $17,393,000 in 2014, associated with two multifamily venture properties. Included in multifamily construction contract costs are charges of $1,531,000 in 2015 reflecting estimated cost increases associated with our fixed fee contracts as general contractor for these two multifamily venture properties compared to $5,107,000 in 2014. Cost of sales in 2015 includes $33,375,000 in carrying value related to Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily property we developed as a merchant builder and sold. In addition, cost of sales includes non-cash impairment charges of $1,044,000 in 2015 and $399,000 in 2014.\nOperating expenses consist of:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property taxes\n</td> <td>5,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>5,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in operating expenses for 2016 is principally related to decrease in depreciation and amortization and property taxes associated with first quarter 2016 sale of Eleven multifamily project and fourth quarter 2015 sale of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project. The increase in operating expenses for 2015 when compared with 2014 was primarily due to increase in depreciation and amortization associated with the acquisition of Eleven multifamily project in which we previously held a 25 percent equity interest and completion of Midtown Cedar Hill multifamily project in 2015.\nInterest income principally represents interest received on reimbursements from utility and improvement districts. Interest income in year 2014 principally represents earnings from a loan secured by a mixed-use real estate community in Houston that was paid in full in first quarter 2015.\nIn 2016, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $95,336,000 related to sale of Radisson Hotel & Suites, a gain of $9,116,000 related to sale of Eleven, a gain of $1,223,000 associated with sale of Dillon, a gain of $10,363,000 related to sale of our interest in 3600,, a gain of $3,968,000 associated with sale of Music Row, a loss of $3,870,000 related to selling the Downtown Edge multifamily site, a gain of $1,219,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond supporting the 2014 Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) bond offering and $501,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax revenues from CCSID. The surety bond has a balance of $6,631,000 at year-end 2016. The surety bond will decrease as CCSID makes annual ad valorem tax rebate payments to San Antonio Real Estate (SARE) owner of the Resort, which obligation is scheduled to be retired in full by 2020.\nIn 2015, gain on sale of assets includes a gain of $1,160,000 associated with the reduction of a surety bond in connection with the CCSID bond offering in 2014 and $425,000 of excess hotel occupancy and sales and use tax pledged revenues from CCSID after their payments to the debt service fund.\nIn 2014, gain on sale of assets principally includes a gain of $10,476,000 associated with a non-monetary exchange of leasehold timber rights on approximately 10,300 acres for 5,400 acres of undeveloped land with a partner in a consolidated venture, a gain of $7,610,000 related to acquiring our partner's interest in the Eleven multifamily venture, a gain of $6,577,000 related to bond proceeds received from Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) at our Cibolo Canyons project near San Antonio, and a gain of $1,318,000 associated with the sale of a land purchase option contract.\nDecreases in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower residential, commercial and undeveloped sales activity. Increase in equity earnings from our unconsolidated ventures in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to increased lot sales activity associated with two projects in Houston and increased undeveloped land sales from a venture in Atlanta.\nWe underwrite real estate development projects based on a variety of assumptions incorporated into our development plans, including the timing and pricing of sales and leasing and costs to complete development. Our development plans are periodically reviewed in comparison to our return projections and expectations, and we may revise our plans as business conditions warrant. If as a result of changes to our development plans the anticipated future net cash flows are reduced such that our basis in a project is not fully recoverable, we may be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge for such project. See Part I, Item 1. Business for information about our net investment in owned and consolidated real estate by geographic location at year-end 2016.\nMineral resources\nIn 2016, we determined that our owned mineral assets were non-core and that we would explore opportunistically divesting these assets.\nAt year-end 2016, we classified our non-core mineral assets as held for sale. On February 17, 2017, we sold substantially all of our remaining oil and gas assets for a total purchase price of $85,600,000, of which $75,000,000 was received at closing. The balance of the purchase price is being held in a third-party escrow account pending completion of (a) title review, and (b) transfer of certain mineral interests owned by a venture in which the Company is a member. In first quarter 2017, we expect to recognize a gain on sale of approximately $82,400,000, of which $10,600,000 will be deferred until verification of accepted title for non-producing fee minerals in Texas"}
