Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a comparison of the 2019 results to the 2018 results and other 2018 information not included herein, refer to the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecent Developments: Pending Acquisition of AmeriHome\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Aris Mortgage Holding Company, LLC (\"Aris\"), the parent company of AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC ( AmeriHome\u201d), and certain other parties, pursuant to which Aris will merge with an indirect subsidiary of the Bank. Following the merger, AmeriHome will continue to use its trade name, continuing to operate as AmeriHome, a Western Alliance Bank company. Pursuant to the agreement, WAB will pay cash consideration of $275 million plus the adjusted tangible book value of Aris at closing, for an estimated aggregate cash consideration of $1.0 billion (inclusive of certain transaction expenses and management bonus payments) based on December 31, 2020 financial statements of Aris. James Furash, Chief Executive Officer of AmeriHome, and other founding management team members of AmeriHome will continue in their roles following the merger. The merger, which remains subject to required regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.\nRecent Developments: COVID-19 and the CARES Act\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Many states, including Arizona, where we are headquartered, and California and Nevada, in which we have significant operations, continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nThe CARES Act was enacted in March 2020 and provides for approximately $2.2 trillion in emergency economic relief measures including, among other things, loan programs for small and mid-sized businesses and other economic relief for impacted businesses and industries, including financial institutions. Separately, and also in response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve's FOMC has set the federal funds target rate - i.e., the interest rate at which depository institutions such as the Bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis - to a historic low. In March 2020, the FOMC set the federal funds target rate at 0 to 0.25 percent.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and certain provisions of the CARES Act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on the Company's operations, as further discussed below.\nFinancial position and results of operations\nThe Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current uncertainty in the overall economy attributable to the pandemic contributed to the $123.6 million provision for credit losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020. While the Company has not to date experienced significant writeoffs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect the Company's estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions continue to worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company's interest income also may be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments, interest and fees. Additionally, net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, slow growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios.\nThe below table details the Company's exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total Loan Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry (1): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,163.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor dependent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,240.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>491.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,555.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Balances capture credit exposures in the business segments that manage the significant majority of industry relationships.\n(2)Consists of real estate secured loan amounts that have significant retail dependency.\nWhile the Company has not experienced disproportionate impacts among its business segments to date, borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines.\nLending operations and accommodations to borrowers\nThe Company assisted our customers with applications for resources through the PPP and approved over 4,700 applications under the original program. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of loans originated under the original PPP totaled $1.5 billion.\nThe original PPP terminated on August 8, 2020, but was reopened in January 2021, with $284 billion in additional funding. As part of the resumption of program, significant clarifications and modifications were made related to the scope of businesses eligible, expansion of the scope of expenses eligible for forgiveness, and simplification of forgiveness mechanisms for loans of $150,000 or less. Eligible businesses may apply for and receive PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and certain small businesses that previously received a loan under the original program may be eligible to obtain an additional loan. These loans have a five-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%.\nThe CARES Act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. This includes the following (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications. The types of loan modifications granted to borrowers include extensions of loan maturity dates, covenant waivers, interest only payments for a specified period of time, and loan payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding modifications meeting these conditions on loans with a net balance of $538.3 million as of December 31, 2020, of which, modifications involving loan payment deferrals total $190.0 million. Further, residential mortgage loans in forbearance have a net balance of $77.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2020, the balance of loans with an outstanding loan modification was reduced to $293.0 million, with only $10.7 million involving a loan payment deferral.\nThe MSLP supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates through five facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility, the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, the Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility, and the Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not originated a significant amount of these loans.\nCapital and liquidity\nWhile the Company has sufficient capital and does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions include issuance of $225 million in subordinated debt at our bank subsidiary in May 2020, establishing a Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and medium-sized businesses, and temporarily suspending stock repurchases since mid-April. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. Further, management has elected to take advantage of the capital relief option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay.\nAsset valuation\nContinued and sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur processes, controls and business continuity plan\nThe Company has focused first on ensuring the well-being of our people, customers, and communities. Preventive health measures were put in place, which included establishing social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers visiting branches, preventive cleaning at offices and branches, and elimination of business related travel. The Company has returned employees to the office in certain locations subject to applicable health and safety procedures in accordance with guidance from the CDC and local authorities, including regular symptom checks, requiring face cloth coverings, increasing physical space between employees, monitoring the number of employees in the workplace, and requiring employees with COVID-19 related symptoms or exposure to quarantine away from the office.\nThe Company has also concentrated on implementing additional business continuity measures that include establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 team, monitoring potential business interruptions, making improvements to its remote working technology, and conducting regular discussions with its technology vendors. The Company has not experienced significant disruption to its business as the Company has been able to facilitate remote work for its employees and has online tools in place for its customers. The Company believes that it is positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future; however, no assurances can be provided as these circumstances may change depending on the duration of the pandemic.\nFinancial Overview and Highlights\nWAL is a bank holding company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware.

The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At or for the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repossessed assets </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets </td> <td> </td> <td>149.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and still accruing </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and still accruing to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset and Liability Growth\nThe Company's assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company's growth.\nTotal assets increased to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2020 from $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets of $9.6 billion, or 35.9%, relates primarily to loan growth. Total loans increased by $5.9 billion, or 28.1%, to $27.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in loans from December 31, 2019, which includes $1.5 billion in PPP loans, was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $4.9 billion, with smaller increases in construction and land development, CRE, non-owner occupied, and residential real estate loans of $479.2 million, $409.1 million, and $286.9 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $160.1 million.\nTotal deposits increased $9.1 billion, or 40.1%, to $31.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 from $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by an increase of $4.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $3.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, and interest bearing demand deposits of $1.6 billion. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $719.5 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable periods:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Income Statement Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,261.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,225.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>94.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>1,166.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>123.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income after provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,021.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>70.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>491.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>622.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>604.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>115.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share - basic </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share - diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP.

Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nPre-Provision Net Revenue\nPPNR is defined by the Federal Reserve in SR 14-3, which requires companies subject to the rule to project PPNR over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators. Banking regulations define PPNR as net interest income plus non-interest income less non-interest expense. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies.\nThe following table shows the components of PPNR for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,166.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,040.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>915.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>70.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,237.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>959.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>491.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-provision net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>746.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>123.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>115.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTangible Common Equity\nThe following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars and shares in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,413.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,016.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: goodwill and intangible assets </td> <td>298.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tangible stockholders' equity </td> <td>3,115.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,719.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: deferred tax -

The FRB and other banking regulators use CET1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy; therefore, management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis. Specifically, the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In addition, management believes that the classified assets to CET1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality.\nAs permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on its regulatory capital over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of December 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,465.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,016.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualifying goodwill and intangibles </td> <td>296.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disallowed deferred tax asset </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AOCI related adjustments </td> <td>91.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,076.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,693.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divided by: Risk-weighted assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,015.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,390.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 ratio </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,076.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,693.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Trust preferred securities </td> <td>81.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disallowed deferred tax asset </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on changes in fair value liabilities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,158.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,775.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divided by: Tangible average assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,349.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,110.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,158.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,775.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt </td> <td>454.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted allowances for credit losses </td> <td>259.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Tier 2 qualifying capital deductions </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 2 capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>713.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,872.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,257.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital ratio </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Classified assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Divided by: Tier 1 capital </td> <td>3,158.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,775.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Adjusted allowances for credit losses </td> <td>259.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Tier 1 capital plus adjusted allowances for credit losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,417.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,952.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Classified assets to tier 1 capital plus allowance </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Margin\nThe net interest margin is reported on a TEB.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $36.8 million, or 3.0%, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily the result of a $5.2 billion increase in the average loan balance that drove a $51.3 million increase in loan interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income from investment securities decreased by $3.5 million for the comparable period primarily due to a decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in the average investment balance of $499.6 million. Other interest income decreased $11.0 million from the comparable period due primarily to a decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2019, despite an increase in interest-bearing cash account balances of $803.7 million. Average yield on interest earning assets decreased to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 5.30% in 2019, which was primarily the result of a lower rate environment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $94.9 million, compared to $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on deposits decreased $88.0 million for the same period while average interest-bearing deposits increased $2.7 billion, which due to the lower rate environment, reduced the average cost of interest-bearing deposits by 79 basis points. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased by $2.2 million as a result of a $14.9 million decrease in average short-term borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest income reflects a $6.5 billion increase in average interest earning assets, offset by a $2.8 billion increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest margin of 55 basis points compared to 2019 is the result of lower deposit and funding costs in a lower rate environment.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and, upon the adoption of CECL, includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for credit losses was $123.6 million, compared to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The significant increase in the provision for credit losses from the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily related to the current economic environment and estimating expected credit losses under the new CECL accounting standard. This standard changes the methodology for estimating credit losses on financial instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected total loss model. This results in the recognition of expected losses over the life of loans and HTM investment securities at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased, rather than after a loss has been incurred, which results in an acceleration in the timing of loss recognition. Further, as the Company's CECL models incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses, the worsening of economic assumptions due to the ongoing pandemic has also contributed to an elevated provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-interest Income\nThe following table presents a summary of non-interest income for the periods presented:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges and fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from equity investments </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card income </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency income </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lending related income and gains (losses) on sale of loans, net </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of investment securities, net </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value gain (loss) adjustments on assets measured at fair value, net </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, increased by $5.7 million, or 8.8%. The increase is due primarily to a one-time BOLI enhancement fee and an increase in income from equity investments from the prior year. A BOLI enhancement fee of $5.6 million was the predominant driver of the $6.3 million increase in income from BOLI from the prior year, and resulted from a surrender and replacement of certain policies, which was intended to offset an increase in tax expense related to the surrender. Income from equity investments was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to an increase in SBIC and warrant income of $3.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively. These increases to non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in investment security sales and lending related income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold investment securities as part of a portfolio balancing initiative that resulted in a net gain on sale of $3.1 million that did not recur during the current year. The decrease in lending related income of $2.2 million is primarily due to loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 that resulted in a net loss of $1.7 million, compared to a net gain of $0.7 million in 2019.\nNon-interest Expense\nThe following table presents a summary of non-interest expense for the periods presented:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal, professional, and directors' fees </td> <td>42.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy </td> <td>34.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit costs </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan and repossessed asset expenses </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business development </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card expense </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible amortization </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain) loss on sales / valuations of repossessed and other assets </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>491.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, increased $9.6 million, or 2.0%. This increase primarily relates to salaries and employee benefits, legal, professional, and director's fees, and data processing costs. Salaries and employee benefits have increased as the Company supports its continued growth through hiring efforts and performance incentives offered to employees. Full-time equivalent employees increased 4.4% to 1,915 from December 31, 2019. Legal, professional, and directors' fees and data processing expenses increased year-over-year by $5.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as the Company continues to build out its infrastructure through technology initiatives that position the Company for continued growth. These increases to non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in deposit costs, other non-interest expenses, and net losses on the sale of other assets. Deposit costs consist of earnings credits on select deposits and fees to the Promontory Interfinancial Network and others for reciprocal deposits. The decrease in deposit costs of $13.2 million for 2020 compared to 2019 relates primarily to a decline in deposit earnings credits paid to account holders due to a lower rate environment. The decrease in other non-interest expense of $7.3 million is primarily due to decreases in business related travel and entertainment expenses of $5.3 million as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. The change in net (gain) loss on sales/valuations of repossessed and other assets of $5.3 million primarily relates to gains recognized in the current year on the sale of OREO properties, compared to a net loss in the prior year from impairment charges on OREO.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company's effective tax rate was 18.62%, 17.39% and 14.61%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is due primarily to tax expense associated with the surrender of bank owned life insurance, no valuation allowance release in 2020 and return to provision adjustments. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is due primarily to management's decision during the third quarter of 2018 to carryback its 2017 federal NOLs.\nBusiness Segment Results\nThe Company has made changes to its reportable segments, which have been reflected in the Company's operating segment results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company's reportable segments are aggregated with a focus on products and services offered and consist of three reportable segments:\n\u2022Commercial segment: provides commercial banking and treasury management products and services to small and middle-market businesses, specialized banking services to sophisticated commercial institutions and investors within niche industries, as well as financial services to the real estate industry.\n\u2022Consumer Related segment: offers both commercial banking services to enterprises in consumer-related sectors and consumer banking services, such as residential mortgage banking.\n\u2022Corporate & Other segment: consists of the Company's investment portfolio, Corporate borrowings and other related items, income and expense items not allocated to our other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations.\nThe following tables present selected operating segment information for the periods presented:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Consolidated Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>Consumer Related </td> <td> </td> <td>Corporate & Other </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,053.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,245.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,798.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>31,930.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,448.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,936.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,123.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,767.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,352.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>22,796.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,067.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,644.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,084.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>622.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>612.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(210.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>555.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(58.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nTotal assets increased $9.6 billion, or 35.9%, to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets relates primarily to organic loan growth and increases in cash and investment securities. Loans increased $5.9 billion, or 28.1%, to $27.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $21.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans from December 31, 2019 was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $4.9 billion, construction and land development loans of $479.2 million, CRE, non-owner occupied loans of $409.1 million, and residential real estate loans of $286.9 million.\nTotal liabilities increased $9.2 billion, or 38.8%, to $33.0 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $23.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in liabilities is due primarily to an increase in total deposits. Total deposits increased $9.1 billion, or 40.1%, to $31.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by an increase in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $4.9 billion, savings and money market deposits of $3.3 billion, and interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.6 billion, offset in part by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $719.5 million.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $396.8 million, or 13.2%, to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity relates primarily to net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and an increase in the fair value of the Company's AFS portfolio, which is recognized as part of AOCI, partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases under its common stock repurchase plan.\nInvestment securities\nDebt securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either HTM, AFS, or trading based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. AFS securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities are recorded as part of AOCI in stockholders' equity, net of tax. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on MBS is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in current period earnings.\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements, and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio for each of the periods below:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

increased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase is largely attributable to purchases of tax-exempt municipal securities during the year, an increase of $716.2 million from December 31, 2019. The Company increased its investments in these types of securities to take advantage of dislocations in the municipal market as credit spreads widened significantly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these purchases consisted of essential service revenue bonds, rated AA to A.\nThe Company also deployed excess liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2020, with purchases of private label residential MBS, corporate debt securities, and CLOs. Private label residential MBS increased $347.7 million from December 31, 2019 and consist of senior tranche bonds, rated AAA. The Company's corporate debt securities portfolio increased $170.3 million from December 31, 2019, resulting from purchases of subordinated debt of other financial institutions. The Company considered the financial condition of these financial institutions and the yield relative to other similarly rated securities in its decision to increase its corporate debt securities portfolio. The Company also began purchasing CLOs as these are floating rate investments that generate yields that are higher than those for MBS and will benefit from future increases in interest rates. The Company's CLO portfolio consists of second or third credit tranche bonds of structured transactions, rated AA to A.\nWeighted average yield on investment securities is calculated by dividing income within each maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment and has not been tax-effected on tax-exempt obligations. For purposes of calculating the weighted average yield, AFS securities are carried at amortized cost in the table below. The maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the Company's investment security portfolios at December 31, 2020 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

any subprime MBS in its investment portfolio. Approximately half of its MBS are GSE issued. The MBS that are not GSE issued consist primarily of $1.4 billion rated AAA, $90.1 million rated AA, with only $0.9 million that are non-investment grade.\nGross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 relate primarily to changes in interest rates and other market conditions that are not considered to be credit-related issues. The Company has reviewed its securities on which there is an unrealized loss in accordance with its allowance for credit losses policy described in \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. Based on the analysis performed, management determined that an allowance for credit losses on the Company's AFS securities was not necessary at December 31, 2020.\nThe credit loss model under ASC 326-20, applicable to HTM debt securities, requires recognition of lifetime expected credit losses through an allowance account at the time the security is purchased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for credit losses on HTM debt securities was $4.1 million resulting in a total allowance of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2020.\nLoans\nThe Company's primary portfolio segments have changed to align with the methodology applied in estimating the allowance for credit losses under CECL. In addition, as the concept of impaired loans does not exist under CECL, disclosures that related solely to impaired loans have been removed.\nThe table below summarizes the distribution of the Company's held for investment loan portfolio at the end of each of the periods indicated:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse lending </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,340.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal & nonprofit </td> <td> </td> <td>1,728.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tech & Innovation </td> <td> </td> <td>2,548.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>5,911.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRE - owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>1,909.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel Franchise Finance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,983.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other CRE - non-owned occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>3,640.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>2,378.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td>2,429.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>183.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans HFI </td> <td> </td> <td>27,053.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>(278.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans HFI, net of allowance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,774.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, held for investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,391.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,765.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,841.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,859.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>5,261.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,223.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,911.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,549.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate - owner occupied </td> <td> </td> <td>2,320.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,329.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,245.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,015.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td>1,971.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,155.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,647.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,489.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>2,147.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,203.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td>56.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred loan fees and costs </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs </td> <td> </td> <td>21,101.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,710.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,093.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,189.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>(167.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(152.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans HFI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,933.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,557.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,953.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,064.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans that are held for investment are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for net deferred fees and costs, premiums and discounts on acquired and purchased loans, and an allowance for credit losses. Net deferred loan fees of $75.4 million and $47.7 million reduced the carrying value of loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Net unamortized purchase premiums on acquired and purchased loans of $26.0 million and $19.6 million increased the carrying value of loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company also had $21.8 million of HFS loans.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of loans outstanding by type of loan as of December 31, 2020 that were contractually due in one year or less, more than one year and less than five years, and more than five years based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal.

The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to a borrower's financial situation include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity or renewal of the loan at an interest rate below current market, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction in the accrued interest, or deferral of interest payments. The majority of the Company's modifications are extensions in terms or deferral of payments which result in no lost principal or interest followed by reductions in interest rates or accrued interest. Consistent with regulatory guidance, a TDR loan that is subsequently modified in another restructuring agreement but has shown sustained performance and classification as a TDR, will be removed from TDR status provided that the modified terms were market-based at the time of modification.\nThe CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that would otherwise be characterized as TDRs and suspend any determination related thereto if (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. In addition, federal bank regulatory authorities have issued guidance to encourage financial institutions to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and have assured financial institutions that they will neither receive supervisory criticism for such prudent loan modifications, nor be required by examiners to automatically categorize COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications. The types of loan modifications granted to borrowers include extensions of loan maturity dates, covenant waivers, interest only payments for a specified period of time, and loan payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding modifications meeting these conditions on loans with a net balance of $538.3 million as of December 31, 2020, of which, modifications involving loan payment deferrals total $190.0 million. Further, residential mortgage loans in forbearance have a net balance of $77.1 million as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's TDR loans totaled $61.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had 17 new TDR loans with a recorded investment of $37.3 million. The Company has a $2.7 million allowance allocated to these loans as of December 31, 2020 and has committed to lend additional amounts totaling $0.6 million.\nThe following table presents TDR loans

Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subsequently evaluated for impairment at least annually. The Company has goodwill totaling $289.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. While the Company's stock price has experienced volatility and periodic declines in value during the pandemic, management did not consider this decline to be a triggering event that would indicate that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary during 2020. Based on the Company's annual goodwill and intangibles impairment tests as of October 1 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, it was determined that goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired.\nThe following is a summary of acquired intangible assets:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Accumulated Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Accumulated Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Carrying Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subject to amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationship intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Impairment </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Carrying Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Impairment </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Carrying Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not subject to amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade name </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred Tax Assets\nNet deferred tax assets increased $13.3 million to $31.3 million from December 31, 2019. This overall increase in net deferred tax assets was primarily the result of an increase in the allowance for credit losses under the new CECL accounting guidance and deferred insurance premiums deduction which were not fully offset by additional unrealized gains on AFS securities and increases to unearned insurance premiums.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has no deferred tax valuation allowance.\nDeposits\nDeposits are the primary source for funding the Company's asset growth. Total deposits increased to $31.9 billion at December 31, 2020, from $22.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.1 billion, or 40.1%. The increase in deposits is attributable to increases in non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $4.9 billion, savings and money market deposits of $3.3 billion, and interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $719.5 million from December 31, 2019.\nWAB is a participant in the Promontory Interfinancial Network, a network that offers deposit placement services such as CDARS and ICS, which offer products that qualify large deposits for FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2020, the Company has $496.4 million of CDARS deposits and $1.3 billion of ICS deposits, compared to $407.7 million of CDARS deposits and $661.8 million of ICS deposits at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company also has wholesale brokered deposits of $554.8 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nIn addition, deposits for which the Company provides account holders with earnings credits or referral fees totaled $5.9 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company incurred $17.0 million and $30.5 million in deposit related costs on these deposits during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These costs are\nreported in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense. The decrease in these costs largely relates to a decrease in earnings credits paid in 2020 due to a lower rate environment.\nThe average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits are presented below:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing transaction accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,488.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,545.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,891.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings and money market accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>10,008.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,125.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,501.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit </td> <td> </td> <td>1,997.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,117.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,748.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest-bearing deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>15,494.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,788.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,141.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest-bearing demand deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>11,465.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,246.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,712.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,960.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,035.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,853.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of Deposit of $100,000 or More\nThe table below discloses the remaining maturity for certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>945.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 to 6 months </td> <td> </td> <td>403.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>596.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 to 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td>494.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td>128.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,451.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,241.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Borrowings\nThe Company from time to time utilizes short-term borrowed funds to support short-term liquidity needs generally created by increased loan demand. The majority of these short-term borrowed funds consist of advances from the FHLB and customer repurchase agreements. The Company's borrowing capacity with the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. In addition, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources, collateralized by securities, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, and may require additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. At December 31, 2020, total short-term borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements of $16.0 million and short-term FHLB advances of $5.0 million. At December 31, 2019, total short-term borrowed funds consisted of customer repurchase agreements of $16.7 million.\nQualifying Debt\nQualifying debt consists of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt, inclusive of issuance costs and fair market value adjustments. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of qualifying debt was $469.8 million, compared to $319.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in qualifying debt from December 31, 2019 is due to issuance of $225.0 million of subordinated debt, recorded net of issuance costs, in May 2020, offset in part by a $75 million redemption of subordinated debt in October 2020.\nThe junior subordinated debt has contractual balances and maturity dates as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name of Trust </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At fair value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BankWest Nevada Capital Trust II </td> <td> </td> <td>2033 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intermountain First Statutory Trust I </td> <td> </td> <td>2034 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Independent Statutory Trust I </td> <td> </td> <td>2035 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAL Trust No. 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>2036 </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAL Statutory Trust No. 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAL Statutory Trust No. 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FVO on junior subordinated debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior subordinated debt, at fair value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge Capital Holdings Trust I </td> <td> </td> <td>2035 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge Capital Holdings Trust II </td> <td> </td> <td>2036 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase accounting adjustment, net of accretion (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior subordinated debt, at amortized cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total junior subordinated debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The purchase accounting adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the trusts, pursuant to accounting guidance.\nThe weighted average interest rate of all junior subordinated debt as of December 31, 2020 was 2.58%, which is three-month LIBOR plus the contractual spread of 2.34%, compared to a weighted average interest rate of 4.25% at December 31, 2019.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could trigger certain mandatory or discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's business and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items (discussed in \"Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nIn March 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provides banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. The Company has elected the five-year CECL transition option in connection with its adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. As a result, capital ratios and amounts as of December 31, 2020 exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of ASC 326.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company and the Bank exceeded the capital levels necessary to be classified as well-capitalized, as defined by the banking agencies. The actual capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables as of the periods indicated:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Capital </td> <td> </td> <td>Tier 1 Capital </td> <td> </td> <td>Risk-Weighted Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Tangible Average Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Capital Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>Tier 1 Capital Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>Tier 1 Leverage Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>Common Equity\nTier 1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAL </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,872.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,158.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,015.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,349.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAB </td> <td> </td> <td>3,619.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,078.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,140.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,367.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum capital ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAL </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,257.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,775.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,390.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,110.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WAB </td> <td> </td> <td>3,030.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,703.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,452.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,134.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum capital ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Stock Repurchase Plan\nThe Company has previously adopted common stock repurchase programs, the most recent of which authorized the Company to repurchase up to $250.0 million of its common stock. The Company had $178.4 million in authorized common stock repurchase capacity that expired under the program as of December 31, 2020.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company enters into contracts for services in the ordinary course of business that may require payment for services to be provided in the future and may contain penalty clauses for early termination of the contracts. To meet the financing needs of customers, the Company has financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Company has also committed to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the payments or distributions with respect to the holders of preferred securities of the Company's eight statutory business trusts to the extent that the trusts have not made such payments or distributions, including: 1) accrued and unpaid distributions; 2) the redemption price; and 3) upon a dissolution or termination of the trust, the lesser of the liquidation amount and all accrued and unpaid distributions and the amount of assets of the trust remaining available for distribution. The Company does not believe that these off-balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. However, there can be no assurance that such arrangements will not have a future effect.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposit maturities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,657.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,515.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualifying debt </td> <td> </td> <td>559.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>559.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,408.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,568.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations primarily relate to contracts for software licensing, maintenance, and outsourced service providers.\nOff-balance sheet commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, commitments to extend credit, and credit card guarantees as of December 31, 2020 are summarized below.

accounting policies, including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, adoption of such policies, and the related impact of their adoption. The Company believes that certain of these policies, along with various estimates that it is required to make in recording its financial transactions, are important to have a complete understanding of the Company's financial position. In addition, these estimates require management to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty. The following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates.\nAllowance for credit losses\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the ASUs related to credit losses, which include ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, and ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. The new standards significantly change the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, including off-balance sheet credit exposures, from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses and credit loss expense in those future periods. The allowance level is influenced by loan volumes, loan asset quality ratings, delinquency status, historical credit loss experience, loan performance characteristics, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. Changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. See \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for a detailed discussion of the Company's methodologies for estimating expected credit losses.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent operating results. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelve-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets.\nWhile the Company does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity, in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its liquidity position. These actions include establishing a $1.5 billion Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and\nmedium-sized businesses and suspending stock repurchases effective as of April 17, 2020. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary.\nLiquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Company's business operations or unanticipated events.\nThe ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. The Company's liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and non-pledged marketable securities, is a result of the Company's operating, investing, and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure that funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, the Company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a 12-month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets.\nThe following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the Company's lines of credit:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Available\nBalance </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,452.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to lines of credit, the Company has borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB from pledged loans and securities. The borrowing capacity, outstanding borrowings, and available credit as of December 31, 2020 are presented in the following table:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,986.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,960.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRB: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowing capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,706.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,706.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has a formal liquidity policy and, in the opinion of management, its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next 90-120 days. At December 31, 2020, there is $6.6 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.9 billion in unpledged marketable securities. At December 31, 2019, the Company maintained $2.9 billion in liquid assets, comprised of $434.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and money market investments, and $2.5 billion in unpledged marketable securities.\nThe Parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain non-bank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted. Since deposits are taken by WAB and not by the Parent, Parent liquidity is not dependent on the Bank's deposit balances. In the Company's analysis of Parent liquidity, it is assumed that the Parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders, while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the Parent and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the Parent and its non-bank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the Parent liquidity analysis. Management believes the Parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over 12 months.\nWAB maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements, such as deposit outflows. This capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources. On a long-term basis, the Company's liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios (for example, by reducing\ninvestment or loan volumes, or selling or encumbering assets). Further, the Company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from the FHLB of San Francisco and the FRB. At December 31, 2020, the Company's long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations, commitments, and deposit withdrawals, which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities, and investment sales, if necessary.\nThe Company's liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: 1) cash flows provided by operating activities; 2) cash flows used in investing activities; and 3) cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain non-cash income and expense items, such as the provision for credit losses, investment and other amortization and depreciation. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $670.2 million, $717.8 million, and $541.0 million, respectively.\nThe Company's primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans, the collection of repayments of these loans, and the purchase and sale of securities. The Company's net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities. The net increase in loans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $5.9 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.6 billion, respectively. The net increase in investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $1.5 billion, $109.5 million, and $12.4 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net deposits increased $9.1 billion, $3.6 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively.\nFluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the Company's need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity, and as non-maturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits, due in part to the FDIC limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors. To mitigate the uninsured deposit risk, the Company participates in the CDARS and ICS programs, which allow an individual customer to invest up to $50.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, through one participating financial institution, or a combined total of $200.0 million per individual customer, with the entire amount being covered by FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $496.4 million of CDARS and $1.3 billion of ICS deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has $554.8 million of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts.\nFederal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid. The total amount of dividends that may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank. Dividends paid by WAB to the Parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $160.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, WAB paid dividends to the Parent of $15.0 million.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on recent and recently adopted accounting pronouncements and their expected impact, if any, on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nWAL, WAB, and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies such as WAL.\nSet forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company.\nOverview\nWAL is a separate and distinct legal entity from WAB and its other subsidiaries. As a registered bank holding company, WAL is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision by the FRB, and is regulated under the BHCA. WAL is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol WAL\u201d and the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. The Company is a financial institution holding company within the meaning of Arizona law. WAL provides a full spectrum of deposit, lending, treasury management, and online banking products and services through WAB, its wholly-owned banking subsidiary. WAB is an Arizona chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, Bridge, FIB, and TPB. WAB is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, the FRB as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC as its deposit insurer. WAB's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services providers.\nWAL and WAB are also supervised by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company's non-bank subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the federal banking agencies.\nEnacted in 2018, the EGRRCPA, among other things, amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The EGRRCPA provides limited regulatory relief to certain financial institutions while preserving the existing framework under which U.S. financial institutions are regulated. The EGRRCPA relieves bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as the Company, from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements). In addition to amending the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA also includes certain additional banking-related provisions, consumer protection provisions and securities law-related provisions. While many of the EGRRCPA's changes have been implemented through rules adopted by federal agencies, the Company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of the EGRRCPA as it is further implemented\nCARES Act\nThe CARES Act was enacted in March 2020 to provide economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Many of the CARES Act's programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions like the Company and the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other federal bank regulatory authorities, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and the Bank. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance and regulations with respect to the implementation, lifecycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19.\nThe Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act, the potential impact of new COVID-19 legislation, and other statutes, regulations, and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CARES Act amended the SBA's loan program, in which the Bank participates, to create a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, the PPP, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during COVID-19. In December 2020, Congress revived the PPP and allocated additional PPP funds for 2021. As a result, the SBA is anticipated to modify prior guidance and promulgate new regulations and guidance to conform with and implement the new provisions during the first quarter of 2021. As a participating PPP lender, the Bank continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto.\nBank Holding Company Regulation\nWAL is a bank holding company as defined under the BHCA. The BHCA generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Business activities that have been determined to be related to banking, and therefore appropriate for bank holding companies and their affiliates to engage in, include securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and certain management advisory and data processing services, among others. Bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either: (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nThe BHCA, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions. The BHCA requires prior FRB approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. In April 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule codifying the presumptions used in determinations of whether a company has the ability to exercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the BHCA, and providing greater transparency on the types of relationships that the Federal Reserve generally views as supporting a determination of control. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days' prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency.\nUnder the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and purchase and assumption transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. For further information relating to the CRA, see the section titled Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.\u201d\nUnder Section 6-142 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, no person may acquire control of a company that controls an Arizona bank without the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or Arizona Superintendent. A person who has the power to vote 15% or more of the voting stock of a controlling company is presumed to control the company.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nSection 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations, with certain of these standards applicable to banking organizations over $10 billion, including WAL and WAB, as of the quarter ending June 30, 2014. In October 2012, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB issued separate but similar rules requiring covered banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion to $50 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct an annual company-run stress test. WAL and WAB conducted a company-run capital stress test as required by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2017 and provided the results to the FRB. WAL found the Company would have sufficient capital to maintain regulatory capital levels throughout an economic downturn.\nAs a result of passage of the EGRRCPA, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (including, but not limited to, the resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements therein). Notwithstanding these changes, the capital planning and risk management practices of the Company and the Bank will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory processes of the FRB.\nIn February 2014, the FRB issued a rule further implementing the enhanced prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Although most of the standards apply only to bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the rule contains certain standards that apply to bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets, including a requirement to establish a risk committee of the Company's BOD to manage enterprise-wide risk. The Company meets these requirements. The EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for requiring a bank holding company to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors from $10 billion to $50 billion. Notwithstanding this change, the Company has retained its separate risk committee of independent directors.\nVolcker Rule\nSection 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as the Company and WAB, from: (i) engaging in proprietary trading\u201d and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term \"covered funds\" is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, which includes CLO and CDO securities. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund, including, among other things, loan securitizations, joint ventures, certain types of foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. Further, the final rules permit banking entities, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to invest in or sponsor a covered fund in connection with: (1) organizing and offering the covered fund; (2) certain risk-mitigating hedging activities; and (3) de minimis investments in covered funds. Compliance with the Volcker Rule was required by July 21, 2017.\nThe EGRRCPA and subsequent promulgation of inter-agency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the Volcker Rule, including by eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than $20 billion in average trading assets and liabilities. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve - along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC - issued a final rule modifying the Volcker Rule's prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds ( covered funds\u201d). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund. The final rule modifies three areas of the Volcker Rule by: (1) streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule; (2) addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds; and (3) permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address. The new rule became effective October 1, 2020. The Company believes it is fully compliant with the Volcker Rule, including as modified by the new rule.\nDividends\nThe Company has paid regular quarterly dividends since the third quarter of 2019. Whether the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of WAL's BOD and will depend on the Company's earnings, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the BOD may deem relevant.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the FRB. The supervisory concern of the FRB focuses on a bank holding company's capital position, its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due, and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries. In addition, FRB policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings.\nAs a Delaware corporation, the Company is also subject to limitations under Delaware law on the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year, and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the Company's net assets.\nFrom time to time, the Company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances. Holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt also may limit or impair the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends.\nSince the Company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries, it currently depends on dividends from WAB and, to a lesser extent, its non-bank subsidiaries, for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow. The ability of a state member bank, such as WAB, to pay cash dividends is restricted by the FRB and the State of Arizona. The FRB's Regulation H states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the bank's net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years. Further, without receiving prior approval from both the FRB and two-thirds of its shareholders, a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital.\nUnder Section 6-187 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, WAB may pay dividends on the same basis as any other Arizona corporation, except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the Arizona Superintendent. Under Section 10-640 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due. However, an Arizona bank may not declare a non-stock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the Arizona Superintendent.\nFederal Reserve System\nAs a member of the Federal Reserve System, WAB has historically been required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits, which were to be held in cash or with the FRB. Effective on March 26, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent. The total of reserve balance was $164.1 million as of December 31, 2019.\nSource of Strength Doctrine\nFRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support WAB, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nCapital Adequacy\nThe Capital Rules established a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee's Basel III final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach.\nThe Capital Rules: (i) include CET1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital\u201d instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules' specific requirements.\nPursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:\n\u20224.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\u20226.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;\n\u20228.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and\n\u20224.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (called leverage ratio\u201d).\nThe Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer,\u201d composed entirely of CET1, in addition to these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity, and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Capital Rules became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Thus, the capital standards applicable to the Company include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.\nThe Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. The Capital Rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders' equity be included in CET1 capital; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. The Company, as a non-advanced approaches institution, has made this one-time election.\nThe Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from inclusion in bank holding companies' Tier 1 capital. The Company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional Tier 1 capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios. Although the Company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, the prohibition on the use of these securities as Tier 1 capital going forward may limit the Company's ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.\nAs of April 1, 2020, final rules became effective simplifying the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. Management believes the Company is in compliance, and will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios.\nConcurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule in late March 2020 that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. Subsequently, on August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that allows institutions that adopt the CECL accounting standard in 2020 to mitigate CECL's estimated effects on regulatory capital for two years. The CECL final rule is substantially similar to the interim final rule issued in March 2020 in connection with other CARES Act related regulatory relief. The final rule gives eligible institutions the option to mitigate the estimated capital effects of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The Company has elected this capital relief option.\nPrompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness\nPursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action\u201d should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.\nFor purposes of prompt corrective action, to be: (i) well-capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%; (ii) adequately capitalized, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%; (iii) undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than\n4%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%; (v) critically undercapitalized, a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2%.\nBank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include: (i) the issuance of directives to increase capital; (ii) the issuance of formal and informal agreements; (iii) the imposition of civil monetary penalties; (iv) the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; (v) the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; (vi) the termination of the bank's deposit insurance; (vii) the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and (viii) the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nUnder federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and implementing Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices.\nFurther, Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders ( insiders\u201d). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution's total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the BOD. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank's employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers.\nLending Limits\nIn addition to the requirements set forth above, state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a state-chartered bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Section 6-352 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20% of the bank's capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral.\nBrokered Deposits\nSection 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is well capitalized\u201d or, with the FDIC's approval, adequately capitalized.\u201d However, as a result of the EGRRCPA, the FDIC has undertaken a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than \"well capitalized.\" On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued final rules that amend the FDIC's methodology for calculating interest rate caps, provide a new process for banks that seek FDIC approval to offer a competitive rate on deposits when the prevailing rate in the bank's local market exceeds the national rate cap, and provides specific exemptions and streamlined application and notice procedures for certain deposit-placement arrangements that are not subject to brokered deposit restrictions. These final rules are effective on April 1, 2021. The Company and the Bank do not anticipate a material impact at this time from the new rule.\nConsumer Protection and CFPB Supervision\nThe Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Practices Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or operations.\nDepositor Preference\nThe FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution\u201d of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nSubstantially all of the deposits of WAB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC's DIF. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance is $250,000 per depositor. WAB is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.\nThe FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's CAMELS rating. The risk matrix utilizes different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. WAB is classified as, and subject to the scorecard for, a large and highly complex institution to determine its total base assessment rate.\nUnder the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company's management is not aware of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance.\nFinancial Privacy and Data Security\nThe Company is subject to federal laws, including the GLBA, and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt out\u201d or opt in\u201d authorizations.\nFor example, in August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended GLBA. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions that do not trigger a customer's statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption.\nThe GLBA also requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information.\nFor example, under California law, every business that owns or licenses personal information about a California resident must maintain reasonable security procedures and policies to protect that information and comply with specific requirements relating to the destruction of records containing personal information and disclosure of breaches to customers, and restrictions on the use of customer information unless the customer \"opts in.\" Other states, including Arizona and Nevada where WAB has branches, may also have applicable laws requiring businesses that retain consumer personal information to develop reasonable security policies and procedures, notify consumers of a security breach, or provide disclosures about the use and sharing of consumer personal information.\nThe federal banking agencies, including the FRB, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third-party services providers. In October 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies' expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of financial institutions with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.\nThese laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and obligations require significant resources of WAL and WAB.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws\nWAB has a responsibility under the CRA to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. WAB's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. WAB's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions. WAB received a rating of Satisfactory\u201d in its most recent CRA examination, in January 2019.\nOn December 17, 2019, the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the regulations implementing the CRA. While the proposed rule will not apply to WAB because its primary federal regulator is the FRB, it may impact the overall environment as it relates to CRA compliance and portend future changes by the FRB. Under the rulemaking, the federal banking agencies intend to: (i) clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) update where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) create a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) provide for more transparent, consistent, and timely CRA-related data collection, record keeping, and reporting.\nOn May 20, 2020, the OCC issued its final rule on CRA modernization. However, at the same time, the FDIC announced its withdrawal from the joint rulemaking with the OCC, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for its withdrawal. WAL and WAB expect to monitor developments with respect to the OCC's final rule and assess the impact, if any, of changes to the CRA regulations as a result thereof, including any further proposals from the FRB or FDIC.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco\nWAB is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members to support residential lending, as well as affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. As a member, WAB must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of San Francisco. At December 31, 2020, WAB's total investment in FHLB stock was $17.3 million.\nIncentive Compensation\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Company and WAB, with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on so-called golden parachute\u201d payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. WAL gives stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation annually.\nPreventing Suspicious Activity\nUnder Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the GLBA and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign shell banks\u201d and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. The new Customer Due Diligence Rule, that was effective beginning May 11, 2018, clarified and strengthened the existing obligations for identifying new and existing customers and explicitly included risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Company has a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act Board-approved compliance program and engages in relatively few transactions with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons.\nThe FCRA's Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons\u201d engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.\nFuture Legislative Initiatives\nFederal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry. In addition, federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry, generally. However it is not clear whether such changes will be enacted or, if enacted, what their effect on the Company will be. New legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to WAL or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.", "summary": "The report discusses various aspects of Western Alliance Bancorporation's financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. It includes a pending acquisition of AmeriHome and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations.

following discussion is designed to provide insight on the financial condition and results of operations of Western Alliance Bancorporation and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a comparison of the 2019 results to the 2018 results and other 2018 information not included herein, refer to the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecent Developments: Pending Acquisition of AmeriHome\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Aris Mortgage Holding Company, LLC (\"Aris\"), the parent company of AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC ( AmeriHome\u201d), and certain other parties, pursuant to which Aris will merge with an indirect subsidiary of the Bank. Following the merger, AmeriHome will continue to use its trade name, continuing to operate as AmeriHome, a Western Alliance Bank company. Pursuant to the agreement, WAB will pay cash consideration of $275 million plus the adjusted tangible book value of Aris at closing, for an estimated aggregate cash consideration of $1.0 billion (inclusive of certain transaction expenses and management bonus payments) based on December 31, 2020 financial statements of Aris. James Furash, Chief Executive Officer of AmeriHome, and other founding management team members of AmeriHome will continue in their roles following the merger. The merger, which remains subject to required regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.\nRecent Developments: COVID-19 and the CARES Act\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Many states, including Arizona, where we are headquartered, and California and Nevada, in which we have significant operations, continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nThe CARES Act was enacted in March 2020 and provides for approximately $2.2 trillion in emergency economic relief measures including, among other things, loan programs for small and mid-sized businesses and other economic relief for impacted businesses and industries, including financial institutions. Separately, and also in response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve's FOMC has set the federal funds target rate - i.e., the interest rate at which depository institutions such as the Bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis - to a historic low. In March 2020, the FOMC set the federal funds target rate at 0 to 0.25 percent.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and certain provisions of the CARES Act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on the Company's operations, as further discussed below.\nFinancial position and results of operations\nThe Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current uncertainty in the overall economy attributable to the pandemic contributed to the $123.6 million provision for credit losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020. While the Company has not to date experienced significant writeoffs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect the Company's estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions continue to worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company's interest income also may be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments, interest and fees. Additionally, net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, slow growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios.\nThe below table details the Company's exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n(1)Balances capture credit exposures in the business segments that manage the significant majority of industry relationships.\n(2)Consists of real estate secured loan amounts that have significant retail dependency.\nWhile the Company has not experienced disproportionate impacts among its business segments to date, borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines.\nLending operations and accommodations to borrowers\nThe Company assisted our customers with applications for resources through the PPP and approved over 4,700 applications under the original program. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of loans originated under the original PPP totaled $1.5 billion.\nThe original PPP terminated on August 8, 2020, but was reopened in January 2021, with $284 billion in additional funding. As part of the resumption of program, significant clarifications and modifications were made related to the scope of businesses eligible, expansion of the scope of expenses eligible for forgiveness, and simplification of forgiveness mechanisms for loans of $150,000 or less. Eligible businesses may apply for and receive PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and certain small businesses that previously received a loan under the original program may be eligible to obtain an additional loan. These loans have a five-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%.\nThe CARES Act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. This includes the following (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications. The types of loan modifications granted to borrowers include extensions of loan maturity dates, covenant waivers, interest only payments for a specified period of time, and loan payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding modifications meeting these conditions on loans with a net balance of $538.3 million as of December 31, 2020, of which, modifications involving loan payment deferrals total $190.0 million. Further, residential mortgage loans in forbearance have a net balance of $77.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2020, the balance of loans with an outstanding loan modification was reduced to $293.0 million, with only $10.7 million involving a loan payment deferral.\nThe MSLP supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates through five facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility, the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, the Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility, and the Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not originated a significant amount of these loans.\nCapital and liquidity\nWhile the Company has sufficient capital and does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions include issuance of $225 million in subordinated debt at our bank subsidiary in May 2020, establishing a Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and medium-sized businesses, and temporarily suspending stock repurchases since mid-April. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. Further, management has elected to take advantage of the capital relief option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay.\nAsset valuation\nContinued and sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur processes, controls and business continuity plan\nThe Company has focused first on ensuring the well-being of our people, customers, and communities. Preventive health measures were put in place, which included establishing social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers visiting branches, preventive cleaning at offices and branches, and elimination of business related travel. The Company has returned employees to the office in certain locations subject to applicable health and safety procedures in accordance with guidance from the CDC and local authorities, including regular symptom checks, requiring face cloth coverings, increasing physical space between employees, monitoring the number of employees in the workplace, and requiring employees with COVID-19 related symptoms or exposure to quarantine away from the office.\nThe Company has also concentrated on implementing additional business continuity measures that include establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 team, monitoring potential business interruptions, making improvements to its remote working technology, and conducting regular discussions with its technology vendors. The Company has not experienced significant disruption to its business as the Company has been able to facilitate remote work for its employees and has online tools in place for its customers. The Company believes that it is positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future; however, no assurances can be provided as these circumstances may change depending on the duration of the pandemic.\nFinancial Overview and Highlights\nWAL is a bank holding company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware.

The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics:\n\nAsset and Liability Growth\nThe Company's assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company's growth.\nTotal assets increased to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2020 from $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets of $9.6 billion, or 35.9%, relates primarily to loan growth. Total loans increased by $5.9 billion, or 28.1%, to $27.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in loans from December 31, 2019, which includes $1.5 billion in PPP loans, was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $4.9 billion, with smaller increases in construction and land development, CRE, non-owner occupied, and residential real estate loans of $479.2 million, $409.1 million, and $286.9 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $160.1 million.\nTotal deposits increased $9.1 billion, or 40.1%, to $31.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 from $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by an increase of $4.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $3.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, and interest bearing demand deposits of $1.6 billion. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $719.5 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable periods:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nPre-Provision Net Revenue\nPPNR is defined by the Federal Reserve in SR 14-3, which requires companies subject to the rule to project PPNR over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators. Banking regulations define PPNR as net interest income plus non-interest income less non-interest expense. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies.\nThe following table shows the components of PPNR for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n\nTangible Common Equity\nThe following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide insight on the financial condition and results of operations of Western Alliance Bancorporation and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K and those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a comparison of the 2019 results to the 2018 results and other 2018 information not included herein, refer to the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecent Developments: Pending Acquisition of AmeriHome\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Aris Mortgage Holding Company, LLC (\"Aris\"), the parent company of AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC ( AmeriHome\u201d), and certain other parties, pursuant to which Aris will merge with an indirect subsidiary of the Bank. Following the merger, AmeriHome will continue to use its trade name, continuing to operate as AmeriHome, a Western Alliance Bank company. Pursuant to the agreement, WAB will pay cash consideration of $275 million plus the adjusted tangible book value of Aris at closing, for an estimated aggregate cash consideration of $1.0 billion (inclusive of certain transaction expenses and management bonus payments) based on December 31, 2020 financial statements of Aris. James Furash, Chief Executive Officer of AmeriHome, and other founding management team members of AmeriHome will continue in their roles following the merger. The merger, which remains subject to required regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.\nRecent Developments: COVID-19 and the CARES Act\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. Many states, including Arizona, where we are headquartered, and California and Nevada, in which we have significant operations, continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nThe CARES Act was enacted in March 2020 and provides for approximately $2.2 trillion in emergency economic relief measures including, among other things, loan programs for small and mid-sized businesses and other economic relief for impacted businesses and industries, including financial institutions. Separately, and also in response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve's FOMC has set the federal funds target rate - i.e., the interest rate at which depository institutions such as the Bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis - to a historic low. In March 2020, the FOMC set the federal funds target rate at 0 to 0.25 percent.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and certain provisions of the CARES Act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on the Company's operations, as further discussed below.\nFinancial position and results of operations\nThe Company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current uncertainty in the overall economy attributable to the pandemic contributed to the $123.6 million provision for credit losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020. While the Company has not to date experienced significant writeoffs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect the Company's estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses. To the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions continue to worsen or persist longer than forecast, such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future. The Company's interest income also may be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments, interest and fees. Additionally, net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment. These uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings, slow growth, and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the Company's loan and investment portfolios.\nThe below table details the Company's exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total Loan Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry (1): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,163.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor dependent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,240.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>491.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,555.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Balances capture credit exposures in the business segments that manage the significant majority of industry relationships.\n(2)Consists of real estate secured loan amounts that have significant retail dependency.\nWhile the Company has not experienced disproportionate impacts among its business segments to date, borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines.\nLending operations and accommodations to borrowers\nThe Company assisted our customers with applications for resources through the PPP and approved over 4,700 applications under the original program. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of loans originated under the original PPP totaled $1.5 billion.\nThe original PPP terminated on August 8, 2020, but was reopened in January 2021, with $284 billion in additional funding. As part of the resumption of program, significant clarifications and modifications were made related to the scope of businesses eligible, expansion of the scope of expenses eligible for forgiveness, and simplification of forgiveness mechanisms for loans of $150,000 or less. Eligible businesses may apply for and receive PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and certain small businesses that previously received a loan under the original program may be eligible to obtain an additional loan. These loans have a five-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1%.\nThe CARES Act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. This includes the following (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. The Company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications. The types of loan modifications granted to borrowers include extensions of loan maturity dates, covenant waivers, interest only payments for a specified period of time, and loan payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding modifications meeting these conditions on loans with a net balance of $538.3 million as of December 31, 2020, of which, modifications involving loan payment deferrals total $190.0 million. Further, residential mortgage loans in forbearance have a net balance of $77.1 million as of December 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2020, the balance of loans with an outstanding loan modification was reduced to $293.0 million, with only $10.7 million involving a loan payment deferral.\nThe MSLP supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates through five facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility, the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, the Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility, and the Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not originated a significant amount of these loans.\nCapital and liquidity\nWhile the Company has sufficient capital and does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position. These actions include issuance of $225 million in subordinated debt at our bank subsidiary in May 2020, establishing a Federal Reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and medium-sized businesses, and temporarily suspending stock repurchases since mid-April. In addition, the Company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the FRB, if necessary. Further, management has elected to take advantage of the capital relief option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay.\nAsset valuation\nContinued and sustained declines in the Company's stock price and/or other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a write-down in the value of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur processes, controls and business continuity plan\nThe Company has focused first on ensuring the well-being of our people, customers, and communities. Preventive health measures were put in place, which included establishing social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers visiting branches, preventive cleaning at offices and branches, and elimination of business related travel. The Company has returned employees to the office in certain locations subject to applicable health and safety procedures in accordance with guidance from the CDC and local authorities, including regular symptom checks, requiring face cloth coverings, increasing physical space between employees, monitoring the number of employees in the workplace, and requiring employees with COVID-19 related symptoms or exposure to quarantine away from the office.\nThe Company has also concentrated on implementing additional business continuity measures that include establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 team, monitoring potential business interruptions, making improvements to its remote working technology, and conducting regular discussions with its technology vendors. The Company has not experienced significant disruption to its business as the Company has been able to facilitate remote work for its employees and has online tools in place for its customers. The Company believes that it is positioned to continue these business continuity measures for the foreseeable future; however, no assurances can be provided as these circumstances may change depending on the duration of the pandemic.\nFinancial Overview and Highlights\nWAL is a bank holding company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware.

The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes the Company's key asset quality metrics:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At or for the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repossessed assets </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets </td> <td> </td> <td>149.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and still accruing </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual and repossessed assets to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and still accruing to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to funded loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset and Liability Growth\nThe Company's assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. Therefore, the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company's growth.\nTotal assets increased to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2020 from $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets of $9.6 billion, or 35.9%, relates primarily to loan growth. Total loans increased by $5.9 billion, or 28.1%, to $27.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in loans from December 31, 2019, which includes $1.5 billion in PPP loans, was driven by commercial and industrial loans of $4.9 billion, with smaller increases in construction and land development, CRE, non-owner occupied, and residential real estate loans of $479.2 million, $409.1 million, and $286.9 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CRE, owner occupied loans of $160.1 million.\nTotal deposits increased $9.1 billion, or 40.1%, to $31.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 from $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 was driven by an increase of $4.9 billion in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $3.3 billion in savings and money market accounts, and interest bearing demand deposits of $1.6 billion. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in certificates of deposit of $719.5 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable periods:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Income Statement Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,261.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,225.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>94.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>1,166.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>123.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income after provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,021.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>70.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>491.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>622.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>604.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>115.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share - basic </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share - diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company. Since the presentation of these non-GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, these non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nPre-Provision Net Revenue\nPPNR is defined by the Federal Reserve in SR 14-3, which requires companies subject to the rule to project PPNR over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators. Banking regulations define PPNR as net interest income plus non-interest income less non-interest expense. Management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the Company, it enables investors and others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies.\nThe following table shows the components of PPNR for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,166.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,040.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>915.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>70.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,237.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>959.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>491.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-provision net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>746.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>123.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>115.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTangible Common Equity\nThe following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents total stockholders' equity, less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses. In addition, management believes that these measures improve comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars and shares in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,413.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,016.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: goodwill and intangible assets </td> <td>298.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tangible stockholders' equity </td> <td>3,115.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,719.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: deferred tax - attributed to intangible assets </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tangible common equity, net of tax </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,116.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,721.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,461.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,821.9 </td> <td>"}
