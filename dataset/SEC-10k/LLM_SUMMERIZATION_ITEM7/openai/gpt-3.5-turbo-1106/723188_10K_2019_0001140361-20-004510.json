Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the past two years, although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with SEC disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long-term trends. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Information beginning on page 26 and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that appear on pages 60 through 111. All references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations refer to the consolidated position and results of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.\nUnless otherwise noted, all earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) figures disclosed in the MD&A refer to diluted EPS; interest income, net interest income, and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax-equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The term this year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year 2019, last year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to calendar year 2018, and all references to income statement results correspond to full-year activity unless otherwise noted.\nThis MD&A contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of the Company. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements are set herein under the caption Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 54.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company's business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but also reflects management's discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company's financial performance. It is management's opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include the allowance for loan losses, actuarial assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit plans, the provision for income taxes, investment valuation and other-than-temporary impairment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and acquired loan valuations. A summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note A, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, starting on page 65.\nSupplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations\nThe Company also provides supplemental reporting of its results on an operating,\u201d adjusted net\u201d or tangible\u201d basis, from which it excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts), accretion on non-impaired purchased loans, acquisition expenses, the unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and the one-time benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Although adjusted net income\u201d as defined by the Company is a non-GAAP measure, the Company's management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisitions and other non-recurring activity in its reported results. Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in Table 20.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services to retail, commercial and municipal customers. The Company's banking subsidiary is Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank\u201d or CBNA\u201d). The Company also provides employee benefit and trust related services via its Benefit Plans Administrative Services, Inc. ( BPAS\u201d) subsidiary, and wealth management and insurance-related services.\nThe Company's core operating objectives are: (i) grow the branch network, primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy, and certain selective de novo expansions, (ii) build profitable loan and deposit volume using both organic and acquisition strategies, (iii) manage an investment securities portfolio to complement the Company's loan and deposit strategies and optimize interest rate risk, yield and liquidity, (iv) increase the noninterest component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income, growth in existing financial services business units, and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses, and (v) utilize technology to deliver customer-responsive products and services and improve efficiencies.\nSignificant factors reviewed by management to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share; return on assets and equity; components of net interest margin; noninterest revenues; noninterest expenses; asset quality; loan and deposit growth; capital management; performance of individual banking and financial services units; performance of specific product lines and customers; liquidity and interest rate sensitivity; enhancements to customer products and services and their underlying performance characteristics; technology advancements; market share; peer comparisons; and the performance of recently acquired businesses.\nOn October 21, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Steuben Trust Corporation ( Steuben\u201d), parent company of Steuben Trust Company, a New York State chartered bank headquartered in Hornell, New York, for approximately $104.4 million in Company stock and cash. Steuben currently operates 14 branch locations in Western New York. The acquisition will extend the Company's footprint into two new counties in Western New York State and enhance the Company's presence in four Western New York State counties in which it currently operates. The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020, pending both customary regulatory and Steuben shareholder approval. The Company expects to incur certain one-time, transaction-related costs in 2020 in connection with the Steuben acquisition.\nOn September 18, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, Community Investment Services, Inc. ( CISI\u201d), completed its acquisition of certain assets of a practice engaged in the financial services business headquartered in Syracuse, New York. The Company paid $0.5 million in cash to acquire a customer list, and recorded a $0.5 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Company completed its merger with Kinderhook Bank Corp. ( Kinderhook\u201d), parent company of The National Union Bank of Kinderhook, headquartered in Kinderhook, New York, for $93.4 million in cash. The merger added 11 branch locations across a five county area in the Capital District of Upstate New York. The merger resulted in the acquisition of $642.8 million of assets, including $479.9 million of loans and $39.8 million of investment securities, as well as $568.2 million of deposits and $40.3 million in goodwill.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, CISI, completed its acquisition of certain assets of Wealth Resources Network, Inc. ( Wealth Resources\u201d), a financial services business headquartered in Liverpool, New York. The Company paid $1.2 million in cash to acquire a customer list from Wealth Resources, and recorded a $1.2 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nThe Company reported net income of $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 that was 0.3% above the prior year, while earnings per share of $3.23 for the year was 0.3% below the prior year. The increase in net income was due in part to the expanded business activities from the Kinderhook acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2019. Contributing to the increase in net income was an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses, an increase in gain on sales of investment securities, higher noninterest revenues and lower income taxes. Partially offsetting these items were an increase in acquisition expenses, an increase in noninterest expenses and an increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding attributable to shares issued in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. Net income adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Net Income\u201d), increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Earnings per share adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Earnings Per Share\u201d), of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe Company experienced year-over-year growth in average interest-earning assets, primarily reflective of the Kinderhook acquisition completed in July 2019. Average deposits increased in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflective of organic growth and the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition. Average external borrowings in 2019 decreased from 2018 reflective of a decrease in securities sold under an agreement to repurchase ( customer repurchase agreements\u201d) as well as a decrease in overnight borrowings and a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT Statutory Trust I ( MBVT I\u201d) and the Kinderhook Capital Trust ( KCT\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by subordinated debt acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. Asset quality in 2019 remained stable and favorable in comparison to the end of 2018, with nonperforming loan ratios, the delinquency ratio and the full year net charge-off ratio at December 31, 2019 all improved from one year earlier.\nNet Income and Profitability\nNet income for 2019 was $169.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.3%, from 2018's earnings. Earnings per share for 2019 was $3.23, down $0.01, or 0.3%, from 2018's results. Net income and earnings per share for 2019 were impacted by $8.6 million of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, while the Company recovered $0.8 million of vendor contract termination charges in 2018 that were initially recorded as an acquisition expense in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nNet income for 2018 was $168.6 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 11.9%, from 2017's earnings, while earnings per share for 2018 was $3.24, up $0.21, or 6.9%. The 2018 results included the aforementioned $0.8 million recovery of vendor contract termination charges, while the 2017 results included $26.0 million, or $0.37 per share, of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Merchants and NRS acquisitions. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.39 in 2018 increased $0.59, or 21.1%, compared to the prior year.

The banking segment provides a wide array of lending and depository-related products and services to individuals, businesses and municipal enterprises. In addition to these general intermediation services, the Banking segment provides treasury management solutions and payment processing services. Employee Benefit Services, consisting of BPAS and its subsidiaries, provides the following on a national basis: employee benefit trust services; collective investment fund; fund administration, transfer agency; retirement plan and VEBA/HRA and health savings account plan administration services; actuarial services; and healthcare consulting services. BPAS services more than 3,800 benefit plans with approximately 450,000 plan participants and holds more than $89.3 billion in employee benefit trust assets. In addition, BPAS employs 370 professionals located in 18 states, and occupies 11 offices located in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Puerto Rico. The All Other segment is comprised of wealth management and insurance services. Wealth management activities include trust services provided by the personal trust unit of CBNA, investment products and services provided by CISI and The Carta Group, Inc. ( The Carta Group\u201d), and asset advisory services provided by Nottingham Advisors, Inc. ( Nottingham\u201d). The insurance services activities include the offerings of personal and commercial property insurance and other risk management products and services provided by OneGroup NY, Inc. ( OneGroup\u201d). For additional financial information on the Company's segments, refer to Note U - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe primary factors explaining 2019 earnings performance are discussed in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized by segment as follows:\nBANKING\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Net interest income increased $13.8 million, or 4.0%. This was the result of a $295.4 million increase in average interest earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loans grew $278.9 million driven primarily by the Kinderhook acquisition, and the yield on loans increased 15 basis points from the prior year. Also contributing to the growth in interest income was a $16.6 million increase in the average book value of investments, including cash equivalents. The increase in the average book balance of investments was the net result of investment purchases of $810.1 million in investment purchases during the year and $39.8 million of investments acquired with the Kinderhook transaction, partially offset by $209.9 million in investment maturities, calls and principal payments, as well as the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities. The average yield on investments, including cash equivalents, was consistent with the prior year at 2.58%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $178.5 million due primarily to the addition of deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Borrowing interest expense decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in average balances of $81.0 million, or 19.8%, partially offset by a blended rate that was 14 basis points higher than the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The loan loss provision of $8.4 million decreased $2.4 million, or 22.2%, from the prior year level. Net charge-offs of $7.8 million were $1.3 million less than 2018. This resulted in an annual net charge-off ratio (net charge-offs / total average loans) of 0.12%, which was three basis points lower than the prior year. Year-end nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned both decreased five basis points compared to December 31, 2018 levels.

The decrease in noninterest revenue included an $0.11 per diluted share impact on deposit service fees due to the debit interchange fee limitations established by the Durbin amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Durbin amendment\u201d) that were effective for the Company beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This negative impact of the Durbin amendment was partially offset by an increase in the volume of deposit services fees related to deposit relationships acquired with the Kinderhook transaction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Total banking noninterest expenses, including acquisition expenses, increased $23.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2019 reflective of the $8.6 million in one-time acquisition expenses incurred in 2019, additional expenses associated with an expanded branch network from the Kinderhook acquisition, as well as continued investment in risk management initiatives, business development and marketing, technology and data processing costs.

The decrease in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in average assets, primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, which outpaced the increase in net income that was impacted by $8.6 million in acquisition expenses incurred in 2019. The return on average equity ratio decreased in 2019 as the increase in average equity outpaced net income that was impacted by the aforementioned acquisition expenses. The return on average assets ratio in 2018 increased nine basis points, while the return on average equity ratio decreased one basis point as compared to 2017. The increase in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in net income, reflective of a full year of activities from the Merchants and NRS transactions, which outpaced the increase in average assets. The return on average equity ratio decreased slightly in 2018 as the increase in average equity due primarily to the impact of the shares issued for the Merchants and NRS acquisitions and earnings retention slightly outpaced the increase in net income. The return on average assets adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased two basis points to 1.63% in 2019, as compared to 1.65% in 2018. The return on average equity adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased 61 basis points to 10.03% in 2019, from 10.64% in 2018. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe dividend payout ratio for 2019 increased 4.6% from 2018 as the 10.7% increase in dividends declared from 2018 was higher than the 0.3% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2019 was a result of a 9.7% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. The dividend payout ratio for 2018 increased 0.3% from 2017 as the 12.7% increase in dividends declared from 2017 was modestly higher than the 11.9% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2018 was a result of a 9.1% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan.\nThe average equity to average assets ratio continued to increase in 2019 as the growth in common shareholders' equity outpaced the growth in assets. During 2019, average equity increased 8.5% while average assets increased at a rate of 3.5%. In 2018 average equity rose 12.0% and average assets grew 5.7% in comparison to 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the amount by which interest and fees on earning assets (loans, investments and cash equivalents) exceeds the cost of funds, which consists primarily of interest paid to the Company's depositors and interest on borrowings. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of earning assets.\nAs disclosed in Table 3, net interest income (with nontaxable income converted to a fully tax-equivalent basis) totaled $363.2 million in 2019, an increase of $13.8 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year. The increase is a result of a $295.4 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. As reflected in Table 4, the favorable impact of the increase in interest-earning assets ($11.8 million) and increase in the yield ($10.9 million) was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the increase in interest-bearing liabilities ($0.3 million) and the higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities ($8.6 million).\nThe 2019 net interest margin increased three basis points to 3.76% from 3.73% reported in 2018. The increase was attributable to an 11 basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a 13 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.73% yield on loans increased 15 basis points in 2019 as compared to 4.58% in 2018, including the impact of acquired loan accretion associated with the Kinderhook acquisition. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, of 2.58% in 2019 was consistent with 2018. The yield on investments included the impact of the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities in the second quarter of 2019 with subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds occurring primarily in the fourth quarter. The proceeds from the sale of securities in the second quarter were held in interest-earning cash until more attractive reinvestment options became available in the fourth quarter. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.40% during 2019 as compared to 0.27% for 2018. The increased cost reflects the 10 basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 14 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2019.\nThe net interest margin in 2018 increased four basis points to 3.73% from 3.69% reported in 2017. The increase was attributable to an eight basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a five basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.58% yield on loans increased 19 basis points in 2018 as compared to 4.39% in 2017, including the impact of incremental acquired loan accretion on the Merchants portfolio. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, decreased from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This lower yield on investments is reflective of maturing higher rate investments being replaced with lower-yielding securities and interest-earning cash, as well as the result of a lower fully tax-equivalent adjustment due to the lower federal tax rate associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.27% during 2018 as compared to 0.22% for 2017. The increased cost reflects the three basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 21 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2018.\nAs shown in Table 3, total FTE-basis interest income increased by $22.7 million, or 6.2%, in 2019 in comparison to 2018. Table 4 indicates that a higher average earning-asset balance created $11.8 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $10.9 million on interest income. Average loans increased $278.9 million, or 4.5%, in 2019. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Kinderhook acquisition, which accounted for $217.6 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $22.1 million, or 7.7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, attributable to the higher average balances and a 15 basis point increase in the loan yield.\nInvestment interest income (FTE basis) in 2019 was $0.6 million, or 0.7%, higher than the prior year as a result of a $16.6 million increase in the average book basis balance of investments (including cash equivalents) and an average investment yield of 2.58% that was consistent with the prior year. The higher average investment book balance is inclusive of the $37.7 million of available-for-sale securities and $2.1 million of equity and other securities acquired with the Kinderhook transaction.\nTotal interest income in 2018 increased $28.2 million, or 8.3%, from 2017's level. As shown in table 4, the higher average earning-asset balance created $21.6 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $6.6 million on interest income. Average loans increased $445.5 million, or 7.7%, in 2018. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Merchants acquisition, which accounted for $351.9 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $31.8 million, or 12.5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, attributable to the higher average balances and a 19 basis point increase in the loan yield. On a FTE basis, investment interest income, including interest on cash equivalents, totaled $80.0 million in 2018, $3.6 million, or 4.3%, lower than the prior year as a result of a 21 basis point decrease in the average investment yield from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This decrease in yield was partially offset by a $108.2 million, or 3.6%, higher average book basis balance (including cash equivalents) for 2018 versus the prior year. The lower average investment yield in 2018 was reflective of cash flows from higher rate maturing instruments in the investment portfolio being reinvested at lower interest rates or held in interest-earning cash.\nTotal interest expense increased by $8.9 million, or 50.2%, to $26.6 million in 2019. As shown in Table 4, higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of $8.6 million, while higher deposit balances resulted in a $0.3 million increase in interest expense. Interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets for 2019 increased eight basis points to 0.27%. The rate on interest-bearing deposits of 0.32% was 15 basis points higher than 2018, primarily due to an increase in certain product rates in response to changes in market interest rates during 2018 and 2019. The rate on borrowings increased 14 basis points to 1.86% in 2019, primarily due to the increase in the average variable rate paid on subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts and overnight borrowings. Total average funding balances (deposits and borrowings) in 2019 increased $196.1 million, or 2.2%. Average deposits increased $277.1 million, with $260.0 million of the increase from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average non-time ( core\u201d) deposit balances increased $184.9 million and accounted for 90.3% of total average deposits compared to 91.1% in 2018, due to the addition of $185.9 million in core deposit balances with the Kinderhook acquisition, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in legacy deposits. Average time deposits increased by $92.2 million year-over-year, including $74.1 million in average time deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average time deposits represented 9.7% of total average deposits for 2019 compared to 8.9% in 2018. Average external borrowings decreased $81.0 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to a decrease in average customer repurchase agreements of $42.6 million, a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts of $20.1 million and a decrease in FHLB borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average subordinated notes payable of $6.5 million associated with subordinated notes acquired in the Kinderhook transaction. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT I and the KCT during the third quarter of 2019 for a total of $22.7 million, offset by a partial year of subordinated debt acquired with the Kinderhook transaction.\nTotal interest expense increased by $3.9 million, or 28.3%, to $17.7 million in 2018. As shown in Table 4, higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of $3.5 million, while higher deposit balances resulted in a $0.4 million increase in interest expense. Interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets for 2018 increased three basis points to 0.19%. The rate on interest-bearing deposits of 0.17% was four basis points higher than 2017, primarily due to an increase in certain product rates in response to the increase in market interest rates during 2018. The rate on borrowings increased 21 basis points to 1.72% in 2018, primarily due to the increase in the variable rate paid on subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts and overnight borrowings. Total average funding balances (deposits and borrowings) in 2018 increased $433.4 million, or 5.1%. Average deposits increased $405.3 million, representing an increase of $428.6 million from the Merchants acquisition offset by a decrease of $23.3 million in legacy deposits. Average non-time ( core\u201d) deposit balances increased $420.1 million to 91.1% of total average deposits compared to 90.5% in 2017, while average time deposits decreased by $14.9 million year-over-year, representing 8.9% of total average deposits for 2018 compared to 9.5% in 2017. Average external borrowings increased $28.1 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, as a year-over-year increase in average customer repurchase agreements of $88.9 million was partially offset by a decrease in average FHLB borrowings of $57.9 million and a decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts of $2.9 million. The increase in average customer repurchase agreements is primarily related to a full year of customer activity from the Merchants acquisition, while the decrease in FHLB borrowings is due to cash flows from investment maturities being used to pay down overnight borrowings. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by Community Statutory Trust III during the third quarter of 2018 for a total of $25.2 million, offset by a full year of subordinated debt acquired with the Merchants transaction.\nThe following table sets forth information related to average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Interest income and yields are on a fully tax-equivalent basis using marginal income tax rates of 24.0% in 2019, 24.4% in 2018 and 37.7% in 2017. Average balances are computed by totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of days in that period. Loan interest income and yields include loan fees and acquired loan accretion. Average loan balances include acquired loan purchase discounts and premiums, nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale.\nTable 3: Average Balance Sheet\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Year

The increase was comprised of growth in revenue from the Company's employee benefit services businesses, an increase in wealth management and insurance services revenue and an increase in other banking revenues, partially offset by a decrease in debit card-related revenue related to Durbin amendment mandated debit interchange price restrictions. Noninterest revenues, excluding unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of investment securities, increased by $21.3 million, or 10.5%, to $223.7 million in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was comprised of growth in revenue from the Company's employee benefit services businesses, primarily from a full year of activity associated with the NRS acquisition and organic growth, an increase in wealth management and insurance services revenue and an increase in other banking revenues, partially offset by a decrease in debit card-related revenue related to Durbin amendment mandated debit interchange price restrictions.\nNoninterest revenues as a percent of operating revenues (FTE basis) were 38.7% in 2019, down 0.9% from the prior year. The current year decrease was due to the 4.6% increase in adjusted net interest income (FTE basis), while noninterest revenues increased by the 0.9% mentioned above. The 0.8% increase in this ratio from 2017 to 2018 was driven by a 10.5% increase in noninterest revenues mentioned above, while net interest income increased 7.0%.\nA significant portion of the Company's recurring noninterest revenue is comprised of the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services provided through the branch network, electronic banking channels and other banking revenues, which totaled $70.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 6.4%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in debit card-related revenue due to the impact of Durbin amendment mandated debit interchange price restrictions that were effective beginning in the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by the addition of new deposit relationships from the Kinderhook acquisition. Fees from general banking services were $75.4 million in 2018, an increase of $2.0 million, or 2.7%, from 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of new deposit relationships from the Merchants acquisition, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.1 million in debit card-related revenue due to the impact of Durbin amendment mandated debit interchange price restrictions that were effective beginning in the third quarter of 2018.\nAs disclosed in Table 5, noninterest revenue from financial services (revenues from employee benefit services, wealth management services and insurance services) increased $6.9 million, or 4.6%, in 2019 to $155.2 million. In 2019, financial services revenue accounted for 67% of total noninterest revenues, as compared to 66% in 2018. Employee benefit services generated revenue of $97.2 million in 2019 that reflected growth of $4.9 million, or 5.3%, primarily due to organic increases in the number of supported plans and related participant levels. Employee benefit services revenue in 2018 of $92.3 million reflected growth of $11.4 million, or 14.2%, driven primarily by a full year of activity from NRS.\nWealth management and insurance services revenues increased $2.0 million, or 3.3%, in 2019 due primarily to an increase in OneGroup revenue. Wealth management and insurance services revenue increased $7.9 million, or 16.3%, in 2018 due to revenue growth from OneGroup, which represented $4.2 million of the increase, an increase in revenue from CISI of $2.2 million and an increase in personal trust revenue of $1.5 million.\nEmployee benefit trust assets increased $14.9 billion to $89.3 billion for the employee benefit services segment in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to organic growth in the collective investment trust business. Assets under management increased $793.8 million to $6.6 billion for the wealth management businesses at year end 2019 as compared to one year earlier due to organic growth. Trust assets within the Company's employee benefit services segment increased $11.5 billion to $74.4 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to organic growth in the collective investment trust business. Assets under management with the Company's wealth management services segment decreased $667.9 million to $5.8 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to year-end 2017 due in part to a general decline in overall market valuations late in 2018.\nNoninterest Expenses\nAs shown in Table 6, noninterest expenses of $372.0 million in 2019 were $26.7 million, or 7.7%, higher than 2018, primarily reflective of the $8.6 million in one-time expenses incurred in 2019 related to the Kinderhook acquisition and the additional expenses associated with operating an expanded branch network subsequent to the Kinderhook transaction. Noninterest expenses in 2018 decreased $1.9 million, or 0.5%, from 2017 to $345.3 million, primarily reflective of the $26.0 million in one-time expenses incurred in 2017 related to the Merchants and NRS acquisitions, offset by the expenses associated with operating an expanded branch network and other business activities acquired with the Merchants and NRS transactions for a full year.\nOperating expenses (excluding acquisition expenses and amortization of intangible assets) as a percent of average assets for 2019 was 3.15%, an increase of eight basis points from 3.07% in 2018 and 13 basis points higher than the 3.02% in 2017. The increase in this ratio for 2019 was due to a 6.0% increase in operating expenses, primarily a result of expanded operations from the Kinderhook acquisition, while average assets grew by 3.5% due primarily to net assets and intangibles from the Kinderhook acquisition and organic growth. The increase in this ratio for 2018 was due to a 7.8% increase in operating expenses, primarily a result of a full year of expanded operations from the Merchants and NRS acquisitions, while average assets grew by 5.7% due primarily to a full year of acquired net assets and intangibles from the Merchants and NRS transactions.\nThe efficiency ratio, a performance measurement tool widely used by banks, is defined by the Company as operating expenses (excluding acquisition expenses and intangible amortization) divided by operating revenue (fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest revenue, excluding acquired non-impaired loan accretion, unrealized gain on equity securities, and insurance-related recoveries). Lower ratios are correlate to higher operating efficiency. In 2019, the efficiency ratio was 1.6% higher than 2018 as the 6.0% increase in operating expenses grew at a faster pace than the 3.1% increase in operating revenue, comprised of a 4.6% increase in adjusted net interest income and a 0.9% increase in adjusted noninterest revenue, as defined above. The ratio for 2018 was 0.3% below 2017 as the 8.4% increase in operating revenue, comprised of a 7.0% increase in adjusted net interest income and a 10.5% increase in noninterest revenue, as defined above, grew at a faster pace than the 7.8% increase in operating expenses.

See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal salaries and employee benefits increased $12.6 million, or 6.1%, in 2019, due to the impact of annual merit increases, a partial year expanded operations associated with the Kinderhook acquisition, higher incentive compensation, and an increase in medical expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased $20.5 million, or 10.9%, in 2018, due to the impact of annual merit increases, a full year of expenses related to the employees from the Merchants acquisition in May 2017, a full year of expenses related to the employees from the NRS acquisition in February 2017, higher incentive compensation, an increase in retirement plan costs and higher severance expense. Total full-time equivalent staff at the end of 2019 was 2,763 compared to 2,675 at December 31, 2018 and 2,617 at the end of 2017. The increase in retirement plan expense in 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to the increase in service cost associated with an increase in the number of employees participating in the plan combined with an increase in eligible compensation associated with merit increases and increases in incentive compensation. See Note K to the financial statements for further information about the pension plan.\nTotal non-personnel, noninterest expenses, excluding one-time acquisition expenses, increased $4.8 million, or 3.5%, in 2019, mostly reflective of a partial year of the additional costs associated with the acquired Kinderhook business activities. Increases in data processing and communications, legal and professional fees, business development and marketing and other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. Total non-personnel noninterest expenses, excluding one-time acquisition expenses, increased $4.4 million, or 3.3%, in 2018, mostly reflective of a full year of the additional costs associated with the acquired Merchants and NRS business activities. Increases in occupancy and equipment, data processing and communications, and amortization of intangible assets, all primarily a result of the additional costs associated with a full year of expanded business activities from the Merchants and NRS acquisitions, were partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees, business development and marketing and other expenses.\nAcquisition expenses for 2019 totaled $8.6 million, including $8.0 million associated with the Kinderhook acquisition and $0.6 million associated with the Steuben acquisition. During 2018, the Company recovered $0.8 million of vendor contract termination charges associated with the Merchants acquisition, which were recorded as an acquisition expense during the second quarter of 2017. Acquisition expenses for 2017 totaled $26.0 million, including $24.6 million associated with the Merchants acquisition, $1.2 million associated with the NRS acquisition and $0.2 related to all other acquisitions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company estimates its income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective taxing authorities, plus the impact of deferred tax items. Taxes are discussed in more detail in Note I of the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 90. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company's tax position. If the final resolution of taxes payable differs from its estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions, adjustments to tax expense may be required.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanently lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from a maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when the temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, as of the December 22, 2017 date of enactment, deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new 21% tax rate. Prior to the change in tax rate in 2017, the Company had recorded net deferred tax liabilities based on a marginal tax rate of 37.70%. The change in tax rate resulted in a decrease in the marginal tax rate to 24.29% and a deferred tax benefit of $38.0 million from the write-down of the net deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effect of this change in tax law was recorded as a component of the income tax provision including those deferred assets and liabilities that were established through a financial statement component other than continuing operations.\nThe effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.2%, compared to 20.8% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2017. The effective tax rate of 5.8% for 2017 included the impact of the $38.0 million one-time gain from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate for 2017, excluding the one-time gain from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities, was 29.5%. The decline in the effective rate for 2019, compared to the effective tax rate for 2018, is primarily attributable to an increase in windfall tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation activity and a reduction in certain activity-based state income tax expenses.\nShareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity ended 2019 at $1.86 billion, up $141.5 million, or 8.3%, from the end of 2018. This increase reflects net income of $169.1 million, $6.9 million from the issuance of shares through the employee stock plans, $6.9 million for treasury stock issued to the Company's 401(k) plan, $5.3 million from stock-based compensation and a $35.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. These increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of $81.8 million. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income was comprised of a $37.1 million increase due to changes in the unrealized gains and losses in the Company's available-for-sale investment portfolio, partially offset by a $2.0 million adjustment in the overfunded status of the Company's employee retirement plans. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both 2019 and 2018, shareholders' equity increased by $106.4 million, or 6.0%. Shares outstanding increased by 0.5 million during the year due to share issuances under the employee stock plan, deferred compensation arrangements and to the Company's 401(k) plan.\nShareholders' equity ended 2018 at $1.71 billion, up $78.5 million, or 4.8%, from the end of 2017. This increase reflects net income of $168.6 million, $6.4 million from the issuance of shares through the employee stock plan, $12.6 million for treasury stock issued to the Company's 401(k) plan and $6.1 million from stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of $73.8 million and a $41.4 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income was comprised of a $30.2 million decrease due to changes in the unrealized gains and losses in the Company's available-for-sale investment portfolio and an $11.2 million net decline in the overfunded status of the Company's employee retirement plans. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both 2018 and 2017, shareholders' equity rose by $120.1 million, or 7.3%. Shares outstanding increased by 0.6 million during the year due to share issuances under the employee stock plan, deferred compensation arrangements and to the Company's 401(k) plan.\nThe Company's ratio of ending tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (or tier 1 leverage ratio), the primary measure for which regulators have established a 5% minimum for an institution to be considered well-capitalized,\u201d decreased 0.28% from the prior year to end the year at 10.80%. This was the result of an increase of 7.8% in average adjusted net assets (excludes investment market value adjustment, and a portion of intangible assets net of related deferred tax liabilities), while tier 1 capital increased by 5.0% from the prior year. For additional financial information on the Company's regulatory capital, refer to Note P - Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The tangible equity-to-tangible assets ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 10.01% at the end of 2019 versus 9.68% one year earlier (See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures). The increase was due to tangible common shareholders' equity increasing by 11.6% from the prior year, while tangible assets increased at a lesser 7.8% from the prior year. The Company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to maintain and grow its capital base and maintain its ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities.\nCash dividends declared on common stock in 2019 of $81.8 million represented an increase of 10.7% over the prior year. This growth was a result of the increase in outstanding shares as noted above and a $0.14 increase in dividends per share for the year. Dividends per share for 2019 of $1.58 represents a 9.7% increase from $1.44 in 2018, a result of quarterly dividends per share increasing from $0.34 to $0.38, or 11.8%, during the third quarter of 2018 and from $0.38 to $0.41, or 7.9%, in the third quarter of 2019. The 2019 increase in quarterly dividends marked the 27th consecutive year of dividend increases for the Company. The dividend payout ratio for this year was 48.4% compared to 43.8% in 2018, and 43.5% in 2017. The dividend payout ratio increased during 2019 because dividends declared increased 10.7% while net income increased 0.3% from 2018. The payout ratio increased during 2018 because dividends declared increased 12.7% while net income increased 11.9% from 2017.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity risk is a measure of the Company's ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss. The Company maintains appropriate liquidity levels in both normal operating environments as well as stressed environments. The Company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and, therefore, the active management of its liquidity position remains an important management objective. The Bank has appointed the Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d) to manage liquidity risk using policy guidelines and limits on indicators of potential liquidity risk. The indicators are monitored using a scorecard with three risk level limits. These risk indicators measure core liquidity and funding needs, capital at risk and change in available funding sources. The risk indicators are monitored using such statistics as the core basic surplus ratio, unencumbered securities to average assets, free loan collateral to average assets, loans to deposits, deposits to total funding and borrowings to total funding ratios.\nGiven the uncertain nature of the Company's customers' demands, as well as the Company's desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities, the Company must have adequate sources of on and off-balance sheet funds available that can be utilized in time of need. Accordingly, in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows, liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks and borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( Federal Reserve\u201d). Other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time, including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements, large certificates of deposit and the brokered CD market. The primary source of non-deposit funds is FHLB overnight advances, of which there were $8.3 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are its liquid assets, as well as unencumbered loans and securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had $205.0 million of cash and cash equivalents of which $43.2 million are interest-earning deposits held at the Federal Reserve, FHLB and other correspondent banks. The Company also had $1.8 billion in unused FHLB borrowing capacity based on the Company's quarter-end collateral levels. Additionally, the Company has $1.7 billion of unencumbered securities that could be pledged at the FHLB or Federal Reserve to obtain additional funding. There is $25.0 million available in unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks.\nThe Company's primary approach to measuring short-term liquidity is known as the Basic Surplus/Deficit model. It is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods: first, the amount of cash that could be made available within 30 days (calculated as liquid assets less short-term liabilities as a percentage of average assets); and second, a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional 60 days. As of December 31, 2019, this ratio was 13.9% for 30-days and 13.9% for 90-days, excluding the Company's capacity to borrow additional funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB\u201d) and other sources. This is considered to be a sufficient amount of liquidity based on the Company's internal policy requirement of 7.5%.\nA sources and uses statement is used by the Company to measure intermediate liquidity risk over the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2019, there is more than enough liquidity available during the next year to cover projected cash outflows. In addition, stress tests on the cash flows are performed in various scenarios ranging from high probability events with a low impact on the liquidity position to low probability events with a high impact on the liquidity position. The results of the stress tests as of December 31, 2019 indicate the Company has sufficient sources of funds for the next year in all simulated stressed scenarios.\nTo measure longer-term liquidity, a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time. This five-year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan and other asset growth over the next five years.\nThough remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. Accordingly, management has addressed this issue by formulating a Liquidity Contingency Plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) and the Company's ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to both a short-term and long-term funding crisis.\nA short-term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system, either internal or external, which disrupts orderly short-term funding operations. Such a crisis would likely be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings. A long-term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the Company. Management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events.\nIntangible Assets\nThe changes in intangible assets by reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows:\nTable 7: Intangible Assets\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Balance at\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Additions /\nAdjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance at\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Banking Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629,916\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,307\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670,223\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core deposit intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,573\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,751\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,418\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Banking Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>648,512\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,880\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,751\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>686,641\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee Benefit Services Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,275\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,275\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,545\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,770\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,775\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Employee Benefit Services Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,770\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,050\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>All Other Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,312\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,312\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,705\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,435\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,920\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total All Other Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,435\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,232\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>807,349\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,956\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>836,923\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets at the end of 2019 totaled $836.9 million, an increase of $29.6 million from the prior year due to the addition of $40.3 million of goodwill, $3.6 million of core deposit intangibles and $1.7 million of other intangibles arising from acquisition activity, partially offset by $16.0 million of amortization during the year. The additional goodwill and core deposit intangibles recorded in 2019 resulted from the Kinderhook acquisition, and the other intangibles recorded resulted from the two financial services acquisitions completed by CISI in 2019. Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill at December 31, 2019 totaled $773.8 million, comprised of $670.2 million related to banking acquisitions and $103.6 million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses. Goodwill is subject to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the identified businesses exceeds their fair value, which would necessitate a write-down of goodwill. The Company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 and no adjustments were necessary for the banking or financial services businesses. The impairment analyses were based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also requires the selection of discount rates that reflect the current return characteristics of the market in relation to present risk-free interest rates, estimated equity market premiums and company-specific performance and risk indicators. Management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with its whole-bank, branch and financial services business acquisitions.\nCore deposit intangibles represent the value of acquired non-time deposits in excess of funding that could have been obtained in the capital markets. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years. The recognition of customer relationship intangibles was determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future net income derived from the acquired customer base. These customer relationship intangibles are being amortized on an accelerated basis over periods ranging from eight to twelve years.\nLoans\nThe Company's loans outstanding, by type, as of December 31 are as follows:\nTable 8: Loans Outstanding\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Business lending\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,775,876\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,396,977\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,424,223\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,490,076\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,497,271\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,430,902\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,235,408\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,220,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,819,701\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,769,754\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer indirect\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,113,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,083,207\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,011,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,044,972\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935,760\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer direct\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,378\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,929\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,815\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195,076\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,325\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,709\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>403,514\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,890,543\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,281,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,256,757\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,948,562\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,801,375\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,583\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,233\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans, net of allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,840,632\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,231,837\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,209,174\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,901,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,755,974\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Daily average of total gross loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,542,716\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,263,843\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,818,367\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,881,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,288,091\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs disclosed in Table 8 above, gross loans outstanding of $6.89 billion as of December 31, 2019 increased $609.4 million, or 9.7%, compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting growth in the business lending, consumer mortgage, consumer indirect and consumer direct portfolios, partially offset by a slight decrease in the home equity portfolio. The growth in the loan portfolio was primarily attributable to the Kinderhook acquisition combined with organic growth. Excluding loans acquired from Kinderhook, loans increased $159.7 million, or 2.5%. Gross loans outstanding of $6.28 billion as of December 31, 2018 increased $24.4 million, or 0.4%, compared to December 31, 2017, reflecting growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer indirect portfolios, partially offset by decreases in the business lending, home equity and consumer direct portfolios.\nThe compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR\u201d) for the Company's total loan portfolio between 2014 and 2019 was 10.2%, with approximately 11% of the total growth for the period attributable to organic growth and 89% attributable to acquired balances. The greatest overall expansion occurred in business loans, which grew at a 17.1% CAGR driven mostly by acquisitions during the five year period. The consumer mortgage portfolio grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.5% from 2014 to 2019. The consumer installment segment, including indirect and direct loans, grew at a CAGR of 5.0%. The home equity lending segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.4% from 2014 to 2019, including the impact from acquisitions.\nThe weighting of the components of the Company's loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified. Approximately 60% of loans outstanding at the end of 2019 were made to consumers borrowing on an installment, line of credit or residential mortgage loan basis. The business lending portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year-end 2019: commercial real estate (41%), restaurant & lodging (10%), general services (8%), retail trade (8%), healthcare (6%), manufacturing (6%), construction (4%), agriculture (3%), wholesale trade (3%) and motor vehicle and parts dealers (3%). A variety of other industries with less than a 3% share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 8%.\nThe combined total of general-purpose business lending to commercial, industrial, non-profit and municipal customers, mortgages on commercial property and dealer floor plan financing is characterized as the Company's business lending activity. The business lending portfolio increased $378.9 million, or 15.8%, in 2019 due to loans acquired in the Kinderhook transaction and organic growth. Excluding loans from the Kinderhook acquisition, the portfolio increased $67.7 million, or 2.8%. The portfolio decreased $27.2 million, or 1.1%, in 2018 as contractual and unscheduled principal reductions outpaced organic loan originations. Highly competitive conditions continue to prevail in the small and middle market commercial segments in which the Company primarily operates. The Company strives to generate growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology, and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities in this important product category.\nThe following table shows the maturities and type of interest rates for business and construction loans as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 9: Maturity Distribution of Business and Construction Loans (1)\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td>Maturing in\nOne Year or\nLess\n</td> <td>Maturing After\nOne but Within\nFive Years\n</td> <td>Maturing\nAfter Five\nYears\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural\n</td> <td>$277,442\n</td> <td>$618,034\n</td> <td>$1,739,646\n</td> <td>$2,635,122\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate - construction\n</td> <td>63,155\n</td> <td>37,526\n</td> <td>43,923\n</td> <td>144,604\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$340,597\n</td> <td>$655,560\n</td> <td>$1,783,569\n</td> <td>$2,779,726\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed interest rates\n</td> <td>$84,106\n</td> <td>$381,253\n</td> <td>$734,660\n</td> <td>$1,200,019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating or adjustable interest rates\n</td> <td>256,491\n</td> <td>274,307\n</td> <td>1,048,909\n</td> <td>1,579,707\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$340,597\n</td> <td>$655,560\n</td> <td>$1,783,569\n</td> <td>$2,779,726\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe consumer mortgage loans include no exposure to high-risk mortgage products and are comprised of fixed (98%) and adjustable rate (2%) residential lending. Consumer mortgages increased $195.5 million, or 8.7%, in 2019, including $115.2 million of loans acquired with the Kinderhook acquisition. In 2018, consumer mortgages increased $15.1 million, or 0.7%. The Company's solid performance is a reflection of the attractiveness of its product offerings and its ability to successfully meet customer needs. Market interest rates, expected duration, and the Company's overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the Company chooses to retain versus sell and service portions of its new consumer mortgage generation. The Company is currently holding primarily all of its new consumer mortgage production due to current market conditions. Home equity loans decreased $0.4 million, or 0.1%, from the end of 2018, including $16.1 million of home equity loans acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. The Company continues to experience a low level of utilization of home equity loans.\nConsumer installment loans, both those originated directly in the branches (referred to as consumer direct\u201d) and indirectly in automobile, marine, and recreational vehicle dealerships (referred to as consumer indirect\u201d), increased $35.4 million, or 2.8%, from one year ago. Excluding the $7.3 million in consumer direct loans from the Kinderhook acquisition, the portfolio increased $28.1 million, or 2.2% in 2019. Although the consumer indirect loan market is highly competitive, the Company is focused on maintaining the solid profitability produced by its in-market and contiguous market indirect portfolio, while continuing to pursue its disciplined, long-term approach to expanding its dealer network.\nAsset Quality\nThe following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of December

due, or sooner if management concludes collection of interest is doubtful, except when, in the opinion of management, it is well-collateralized and in the process of collection. As shown in Table 10 above, nonperforming loans, defined as nonaccruing loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due, ended 2019 at $24.3 million. This represents a decrease of $0.7 million from the $25.0 million in nonperforming loans at the end of 2018. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans at December 31, 2019 decreased five basis points from the prior year to 0.35%. Excluding acquired loans, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans at the end of 2019 was down three basis points from the prior year to 0.33%. The ratio of nonperforming assets (which includes other real estate owned, or OREO\u201d, in addition to nonperforming loans) to total loans plus OREO decreased to 0.37% at year-end 2019, down five basis points from one year earlier. The Company's success at keeping these ratios at favorable levels throughout varying economic conditions is the result of continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards, early problem recognition, and effective collection and recovery efforts. At December 31, 2019, OREO consisted of 16 residential properties with a total value of $1.0 million and two commercial real estate properties with a total value of $0.3 million. This compares to 18 residential properties with a total value of $1.3 million at December 31, 2018.\nApproximately 61% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019 are related to the consumer mortgage portfolio. Collateral values of residential properties within the Company's market area have generally increased over the past several years. Additionally, economic conditions, including lower unemployment levels, have positively impacted consumers and resulted in more favorable nonperforming mortgage ratios in 2018 and 2019. Approximately 28% of the nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019 are related to the business lending portfolio, which is comprised of business loans broadly diversified by industry type. The level of nonperforming business loans decreased from the prior year due primarily to the payoff of one nonperforming commercial credit during the fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining 11% percent of nonperforming loans relate to consumer installment and home equity loans. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio, a general measure of coverage adequacy, was 206% at the end of 2019 compared to 197% at year-end 2018 and 173% at December 31, 2017. Excluding acquired loans, the ratio of allowance for legacy loans to nonperforming legacy loans was 262% at the end of 2019, compared to 256% at year-end 2018 and 244% at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's senior management, special asset officers and lenders review all delinquent and nonaccrual loans and OREO regularly in order to identify deteriorating situations, monitor known problem credits and discuss any needed changes to collection efforts, if warranted. Based on the group's consensus, a relationship may be assigned a special assets officer or other senior lending officer to review the loan, meet with the borrowers, assess the collateral and recommend an action plan. This plan could include foreclosure, restructuring loans, issuing demand letters or other actions. The Company's larger criticized credits are also reviewed on a quarterly basis by senior credit administration management, special assets officers and commercial lending management to monitor their status and discuss relationship management plans. Commercial lending management reviews the criticized loan portfolio on a monthly basis.\nTotal delinquencies, defined as loans 30 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status, finished the current year at 0.94% of total loans outstanding, compared to 1.00% at the end of 2018. As of year-end 2019, delinquency ratios for business lending, consumer installment loans, consumer mortgages and home equity loans were 0.69%, 1.12%, 1.10%, and 1.21%, respectively. These ratios compare to the year-end 2018 delinquency rates for business lending, consumer installment loans, consumer mortgages and home equity loans of 0.62%, 1.34%, 1.22%, and 1.21%, respectively. Delinquency levels, particularly in the 30 to 89 days category, tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time, and therefore management believes that it is useful to evaluate this ratio over a longer time period. The average quarter-end delinquency ratio for total loans in 2019 was 0.89%, as compared to an average of 0.96% in 2018, and 1.02% in 2017, reflective of management's continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards, as well as the effective utilization of its collection capabilities.\nLoans are considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) when, due to a borrower's financial difficulties, the Company makes one or more concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These modifications primarily include, among others, an extension of the term of the loan or granting a period with reduced or no principal and/or interest payments, which can be recaptured through payments made over the remaining term of the loan or at maturity. Historically, the Company has created very few TDRs. Regulatory guidance by the OCC requires certain loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be reported as TDRs. In accordance with this guidance, loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy but not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified and the Company's lien position against the underlying collateral remains unchanged. Pursuant to that guidance, the Company records a charge-off equal to any portion of the carrying value that exceeds the net realizable value of the collateral. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 80 loans totaling $3.6 million considered to be nonaccruing TDRs and 168 loans totaling $3.4 million considered to be accruing TDRs. This compares to 62 loans totaling $2.4 million considered to be nonaccruing TDRs and 156 loans totaling $3.1 million considered to be accruing TDRs at December 31, 2018.\nThe changes in the allowance

</tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Legacy loans exclude loans acquired after January 1, 2009.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs displayed in Table 11 above, total net charge-offs in 2019 were $7.8 million, $1.3 million less than the prior year due to a decrease in net charge-offs in the business lending, consumer indirect and home equity portfolios, partially offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the consumer mortgage and consumer direct portfolios. Net charge-offs in 2018 were $1.5 million less than 2017 due to a decrease in net charge-offs in the business lending, consumer indirect and consumer direct portfolios, partially offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the home equity and consumer mortgage portfolios.\nDue to the significant increases in average loan balances over time as a result of acquisitions and organic growth, management believes that net charge-offs as a percent of average loans ( net charge-off ratio\u201d) offers the most meaningful representation of charge-off trends. The total net charge-off ratio of 0.12% for 2019 was three basis points lower than the 0.15% ratio from 2018, and six basis points lower than the 0.18% ratio from 2017. Gross charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.21% in 2019, as compared to 0.25% in 2018, and 0.29% in 2017, evidence of management's continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards. Recoveries were $5.9 million in 2019, representing 41% of average gross charge-offs for the latest two years, compared to 39% in 2018 and 42% in 2017.\nBusiness loan net charge-offs decreased in 2019, totaling $1.5 million, or 0.06% of average business loans outstanding, compared to $3.5 million, or 0.14% of the average outstanding balance in 2018. Consumer installment loan net charge-offs increased to $4.7 million this year from $4.5 million in 2018, with a net charge-off ratio of 0.37% in 2019 and 0.36% in 2018. The dollar amount of consumer mortgage net charge-offs increased to $1.3 million in 2019 compared to $0.7 million in 2018, with a net charge-off ratio of 0.06% in 2019 compared to 0.03% in 2018. Home equity net charge-offs decreased $0.2 million in 2019 and the net charge-off ratio decreased four basis points to 0.08%.\nManagement continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations. Measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to repay. Impaired loans with outstanding balances that are greater than $0.5 million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations. Consumer mortgages, consumer installment and home equity loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively. The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more.\nThe second component of the allowance establishment process, general loan loss allocations, is composed of two calculations that are computed on the five main loan segments: business lending, consumer mortgage, consumer indirect, consumer direct, and home equity. The first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest 36 months of historical net charge-off data for each loan category (business loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations). The second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration eight qualitative environmental factors: levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedure, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. The allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined with unallocated allowances, if any, to derive the required allowance for loan losses to be reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Condition. This allowance methodology was replaced with a new approach beginning with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020. This new accounting guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology under existing guidance with a current expected credit loss methodology, also known as CECL.\nThe loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan losses, net of the interim period net charge-offs, from the current required allowance level. This provision is then recorded in the income statement for that period. Members of senior management and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors ( Audit Committee\u201d) review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly. Management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the Company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations.\nAcquired loans are recorded at their acquisition date fair values and, therefore, are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date. To the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from the acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition, the Company records a provision for potential losses. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, an additional provision for loan losses related to acquired impaired loans of $0.1 million and $0.3 million was recorded, respectively.\nFor acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, a fair value adjustment is recorded that includes both credit and interest rate considerations. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans, however, the Company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining purchased discounts. During 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses on acquired non-impaired loans of $0.9 million. For 2018, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses on acquired non-impaired loans of $1.9 million, of which $1.1 million related to the partial charge-off of a single commercial relationship. During 2017, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses on acquired non-impaired loans of $4.5 million, with approximately $3.1 million related to the partial charge-off of a single commercial relationship in the fourth quarter.\nThe allowance for loan losses increased to $49.9 million at the end of 2019 from $49.3 million as of year-end 2018. The $0.6 million increase was primarily due to changes in asset quality metrics and the composition of the loan portfolio. The allowance for legacy loan losses increased $0.6 million, while the allowance for acquired loan losses was consistent with the prior year. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans of 0.72% for year-end 2019 decreased six basis points from the 0.78% ratio for 2018 and was down four basis points from the 0.76% ratio for 2017, due in part to acquired growth in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance for legacy loan losses to total legacy loans decreased six basis points to 0.87% for 2019 as compared 2018. Management believes the year-end 2019 allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio.\nThe loan loss provision for legacy loans of $7.4 million in 2019, was $1.3 million lower than the prior year, and reflects management's assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio, as discussed above. The loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans was 0.13% in 2019 as compared to 0.17% in 2018 and 0.19% in 2017. The loan loss provision was 108% of net charge-offs this year versus 119% in 2018 and 103% in 2017, reflective of the assessed risk in the overall portfolio.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the end of the years indicated, as well as the proportional share each category is to total loans. This allocation is based on management's assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes when the risk factors of each component part change. The allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends. The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.\nTable 12: Allowance for Loan Losses by Loan Type\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(000's omitted except for ratios)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>Loan Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>Loan Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>Loan Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>Loan Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance\n</td> <td>Loan Mix\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Business lending\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$19,426\n</td> <td>40.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$18,522\n</td> <td>38.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$17,257\n</td> <td>38.5%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$17,220\n</td> <td>30.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$15,749\n</td> <td>31.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,269\n</td> <td>35.3%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,124\n</td> <td>35.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,465\n</td> <td>35.5%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,094\n</td> <td>36.8%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,198\n</td> <td>36.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer indirect\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13,712\n</td> <td>16.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>14,366\n</td> <td>17.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13,468\n</td> <td>16.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13,782\n</td> <td>21.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>12,422\n</td> <td>19.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer direct\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3,255\n</td> <td>2.7%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3,095\n</td> <td>2.8%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3,039\n</td> <td>2.9%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,979\n</td> <td>3.9%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,997\n</td> <td>4.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,129\n</td> <td>5.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,144\n</td> <td>6.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,107\n</td> <td>6.7%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,399\n</td> <td>8.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,666\n</td> <td>8.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquired impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>163\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>33\n</td> <td>0.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>147\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>108\n</td> <td>0.1%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>168\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$49,911\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$49,284\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$47,583\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$47,233\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$45,401\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs demonstrated in Table 12 above and discussed previously, business lending and consumer installment by their nature carry higher credit risk than residential real estate, and as a result these loans carry allowance for loan losses that cover a higher percentage of their total portfolio balances. The unallocated allowance is maintained for inherent losses in the portfolio that are not reflected in the historical loss ratios, model imprecision, and for acquired loan portfolios in the process of being fully integrated at year-end. The unallocated allowance of $1.0 million at year-end 2019 was consistent with December 31, 2018. The changes in year-over-year allowance allocations reflect management's continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques. However, given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management remained conservative in establishing the overall allowance for loan losses. Management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for loan losses to be prudent and reasonable. Furthermore, the Company's allowance for loan losses is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan category.\nFunding Sources\nThe Company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning-asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives. Overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity, stability, and price characteristics; deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations (nonpublic deposits), municipal deposits that are collateralized for amounts not covered by FDIC insurance (public funds), and external borrowings. The average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated:\nTable 13: Average Deposits\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(000's omitted, except rates)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>Average\nRate Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>Average\nRate Paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>Average\nRate Paid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest checking deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$2,401,413\n</td> <td>0.00%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$2,302,806\n</td> <td>0.00%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$2,048,414\n</td> <td>0.00%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest checking deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,048,142\n</td> <td>0.18%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,898,118\n</td> <td>0.09%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,782,668\n</td> <td>0.06%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Savings deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,507,728\n</td> <td>0.06%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,458,676\n</td> <td>0.06%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,385,386\n</td> <td>0.06%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Money market deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,933,437\n</td> <td>0.30%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,046,219\n</td> <td>0.18%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,069,228\n</td> <td>0.14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>843,024\n</td> <td>1.19%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>750,814\n</td> <td>0.58%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>765,666\n</td> <td>0.41%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$8,733,744\n</td> <td>0.23%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$8,456,633\n</td> <td>0.13%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$8,051,362\n</td> <td>0.10%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs displayed in Table 13, average total deposits in 2019 increased $277.1 million, or 3.3%, from the prior year comprised of a $184.9 million, or 2.4%, increase in non-time ( core\u201d) deposits, and a $92.2 million, or 12.3%, increase in time deposits. Excluding the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition, average total deposits increased $17.1 million, or 0.2%, as compared to 2018. Average core deposit balances, excluding deposits acquired in the Kinderhook acquisition, decreased $1.0 million as compared to 2018, and time deposits, excluding the impact of Kinderhook acquired balances, increased $18.1 million, or 2.4%. The cost of deposits, including the impact of non-interest checking deposits, increased 10 basis points from 0.13% in 2018 to 0.23% in 2019.\nTotal average deposits for 2018 equaled $8.46 billion, up $405.3 million, or 5.0%, from 2017 comprised of a $420.1 million, or 5.8%, increase in core deposits, and a $14.8 million, or 1.9%, decrease in time deposits. Excluding the impact of the Merchants acquisition, average total deposits decreased $23.3 million, or 0.3%, as compared to 2017. Average core deposit balances, excluding deposits acquired in the Merchants acquisition, grew $27.8 million, or 0.4%, as compared to 2017, while time deposits, excluding the impact of Merchants acquired balances, declined $51.1 million, or 7.8%. The cost of deposits, including the impact of non-interest checking deposits, increased three basis points from 0.10% in 2017 to 0.13% in 2018.\nNonpublic, core deposits are frequently considered to be a bank's most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable, do not need to be collateralized, carry a relatively low rate, generate solid fee income, and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan, deposit and other financial service-related products can be cross-sold. The Company's funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of nonpublic deposits, which reached an all-time high in 2019 with an average balance of $7.74 billion, an increase of $313.0 million, or 4.2%, over the comparable 2018 period. Excluding the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition, average nonpublic deposits increased $73.1 million during 2019.\nFull-year average public fund deposits decreased $35.9 million, or 3.5%, during 2019 to $995.0 million. Excluding the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition, average public fund deposits decreased $56.1 million, or 5.4%, during 2019. Public fund deposit balances tend to be more volatile than nonpublic deposits because they are heavily impacted by the seasonality of tax collection and fiscal spending patterns, as well as the longer-term financial position of the local government entities, which can change from year to year. However, the Company has many strong, long-standing relationships with municipal entities throughout its markets and the diversified core deposits held by these customers have provided an attractive and comparatively stable funding source over an extended time period. The Company is required to collateralize local government deposits in excess of FDIC coverage with marketable securities from its investment portfolio. Due to this stipulation, as well as the competitive bidding nature of municipal time deposits, management considers this funding source to share some of the attributes of borrowings.\nThe mix of average deposits is largely consistent with the prior year. Core deposits (noninterest checking, interest checking, savings and money markets) represent approximately 90% of the Company's deposit funding base, while non-core time deposits represent approximately 10% of total average deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits of 0.32% in 2019 was 15 basis points higher than the 0.17% cost of interest-bearing deposits in 2018. The total cost of deposit funding, which includes noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.23% in 2019, a 10 basis point increase from the prior year.\nThe remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding as of December 31 are as follows:\nTable 14: Maturity of Time Deposits $250,000 or More\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less than three months\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,306\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,621\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months to six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,028\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,032\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Six months to one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,559\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,307\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,624\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,660\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,517\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,620\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowing sources for the Company include the FHLB, Federal Reserve, and other correspondent banks, as well as access to the brokered CD and repurchase markets through established relationships with primary market security dealers. The Company also had $77.3 million in floating-rate subordinated debt that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts and $13.8 million in fixed-rate subordinated notes acquired with the Kinderhook acquisition outstanding at the end of 2019.\nAs shown in Table 15, year-end 2019 borrowings totaled $344.9 million, a decrease of $68.8 million from the $413.7 million outstanding at the end of 2018 primarily due to the redemption of the trust preferred subordinated debt held by MBVT I, an unconsolidated subsidiary trust, during 2019, a decrease in securities sold under an agreement to repurchase ( customer repurchase agreements\u201d) and a decrease in FHLB overnight borrowings, partially offset by subordinated notes and other FHLB borrowings acquired in the Kinderhook transaction. Borrowings averaged $327.1 million, or 3.6% of total funding sources for 2019, as compared to $408.1 million, or 4.6% of total funding sources for 2018. As shown in Table 16, at the end of 2019 the Company had $264.1 million, or 60% of borrowings, that had remaining terms of one year or less as compared to 76% of borrowings maturing within one year at December 31, 2018.\nAs displayed in Table 3 on page 34, the percentage of funding from deposits in 2019 was slightly higher than the level in 2018 due in part to the redemption of subordinated debt, a decrease in average customer repurchase agreements and a decrease in overnight borrowings. The percentage of average funding derived from deposits was 96.4% in 2019 as compared to 95.4% in 2018 and 95.5% in 2017. During 2019, average deposits increased 3.3%, while average borrowings decreased 19.8%.\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding balance of borrowings of the Company as of December 31:\nTable

financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. These commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. The credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be required based on management's assessment of the customer's creditworthiness. The fair value of these commitments is considered immaterial for disclosure purposes.\nThe contractual amounts of these off-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31 were as follows:\nTable 17: Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143,780\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,134,576\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,872\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,169\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,181,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,167,745\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments\nThe objective of the Company's investment portfolio is to hold low-risk, high-quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its earning asset/funding liability position in order to maximize future net interest income opportunities. This must be accomplished within the following constraints: (a) implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income; (b) providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day-to-day business activities; (c) considering investment risk-weights as determined by the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines; and (d) generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements.\nThe carrying value of the Company's investment portfolio ended 2019 at $3.09 billion, an increase of $106.7 million, or 3.6%, from the end of 2018. The book value (excluding unrealized gains and losses) of the portfolio increased $57.6 million from December 31, 2018. The unrealized gain on the portfolio was $33.8 million as of December 31, 2019. During 2019, the Company purchased $98.6 million of government agency mortgage-backed securities with an average yield of 2.93%, $111.3 million of obligations of state and political subdivisions with an average fully tax-equivalent yield of 3.31%, $542.2 million in U.S. Treasury securities with an average yield of 1.98% and $58.0 million in U.S. agency securities with an average yield of 2.40%. The Company also acquired $37.7 million of available-for-sale securities and $2.1 million of equity and other securities as part of the Kinderhook transaction. These additions were offset by $209.9 million of investment maturities, calls, and principal payments in 2019, and the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities with a remaining maturity of less than five years and a 2.09% yield to maturity. The sale of investment securities in the second quarter of 2019 resulted in a $4.9 million net realized gain. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 4.3 years at the end of 2019, as compared to 2.7 years at year end 2018.\nThe carrying value of the Company's investment portfolio decreased $99.7 million during 2018 to end the year at $2.98 billion. The book value of available-for-sale investments decreased $60.5 million from December 31, 2017, and the unrealized loss on the portfolio was $15.3 million as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, the Company purchased $78.1 million of government agency mortgage-backed securities at an average yield of 3.64%. Offsetting these purchases were $140.8 million of maturities, calls and paydowns of available for sale securities and $5.9 million of maturities and redemptions of other securities.\nThe investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor U.S. Treasury debentures, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs, U.S. Agency CMOs and municipal bonds. The U.S. Treasury debentures, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs and U.S. Agency CMOs are all rated AAA (highest possible rating) by Moody's and AA+ by Standard and Poor's. The majority of the municipal bonds are rated A or higher. The portfolio does not include any private label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or private label collateralized mortgage obligations. The overall mix of securities within the portfolio over the last year has changed modestly, with a decrease in the proportion of U.S. Treasury and agency securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, while the proportion of obligations of state and political subdivisions and government agency mortgage-backed securities increased.\nThe net pre-tax unrealized market value gain on the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019 was $33.8 million, as compared to an unrealized loss of $15.3 million one year earlier. This increase is indicative of interest rate movements over the period and modest changes in the composition of the portfolio.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized cost and market value for

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effect of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Notwithstanding this, inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral, real estate in particular.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d Section of Note A of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 74 for recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company that have not yet been adopted.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report, including management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains comments or information that constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), which involve significant risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipate,\u201d could,\u201d target,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d goal,\u201d forecast, \u201d believe,\u201d or other words of similar meaning. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, the Company's plans, objectives and intentions are subject to change based on various factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control).\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include: (1) risks related to credit quality, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity; (2) the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies where the Company conducts its business; (3) the effect of, and changes in, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; (4) inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; (5) the timely development of new products and services and customer perception of the overall value thereof (including features, pricing and quality) compared to competing products and services; (6) changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; (7) technological changes and implementation and financial risks associated with transitioning to new technology-based systems involving large multi-year contracts; (8) the ability of the Company to maintain the security of its financial, accounting, technology, data processing and other operating systems and facilities; (9) effectiveness of the Company's risk management processes and procedures, reliance on models which may be inaccurate or misinterpreted, the Company's ability to manage its credit or interest rate risk, the sufficiency of its allowance for loan losses and the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates used in preparing the Company's financial statements and disclosures; (10) failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to the Company's operations; (11) any acquisitions or mergers that might be considered or consummated by the Company and the costs and factors associated therewith, including differences in the actual financial results of the acquisition or merger compared to expectations and the realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements; (12) the ability to maintain and increase market share and control expenses; (13) the nature, timing and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries, including changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, accounting, banking, risk management, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; (14) changes in the Company's organization, compensation and benefit plans and in the availability of, and compensation levels for, employees in its geographic markets; (15) the outcome of pending or future litigation and government proceedings; (16) other risk factors outlined in the Company's filings with the SEC from time to time; and (17) the success of the Company at managing the risks of the foregoing.\nThe foregoing list of important factors is not all-inclusive. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. If the Company does update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should not conclude that the Company will make additional updates or corrections with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nTable 20: GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>(000's omitted)\n</td> <td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the past two years, although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with SEC disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long-term trends. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Information beginning on page 26 and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that appear on pages 60 through 111. All references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations refer to the consolidated position and results of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.\nUnless otherwise noted, all earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) figures disclosed in the MD&A refer to diluted EPS; interest income, net interest income, and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax-equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The term this year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year 2019, last year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to calendar year 2018, and all references to income statement results correspond to full-year activity unless otherwise noted.\nThis MD&A contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of the Company. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements are set herein under the caption Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 54.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company's business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but also reflects management's discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company's financial performance. It is management's opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include the allowance for loan losses, actuarial assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit plans, the provision for income taxes, investment valuation and other-than-temporary impairment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and acquired loan valuations. A summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note A, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, starting on page 65.\nSupplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations\nThe Company also provides supplemental reporting of its results on an operating,\u201d adjusted net\u201d or tangible\u201d basis, from which it excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts), accretion on non-impaired purchased loans, acquisition expenses, the unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and the one-time benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Although adjusted net income\u201d as defined by the Company is a non-GAAP measure, the Company's management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisitions and other non-recurring activity in its reported results. Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in Table 20.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services to retail, commercial and municipal customers. The Company's banking subsidiary is Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank\u201d or CBNA\u201d). The Company also provides employee benefit and trust related services via its Benefit Plans Administrative Services, Inc. ( BPAS\u201d) subsidiary, and wealth management and insurance-related services.\nThe Company's core operating objectives are: (i) grow the branch network, primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy, and certain selective de novo expansions, (ii) build profitable loan and deposit volume using both organic and acquisition strategies, (iii) manage an investment securities portfolio to complement the Company's loan and deposit strategies and optimize interest rate risk, yield and liquidity, (iv) increase the noninterest component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income, growth in existing financial services business units, and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses, and (v) utilize technology to deliver customer-responsive products and services and improve efficiencies.\nSignificant factors reviewed by management to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share; return on assets and equity; components of net interest margin; noninterest revenues; noninterest expenses; asset quality; loan and deposit growth; capital management; performance of individual banking and financial services units; performance of specific product lines and customers; liquidity and interest rate sensitivity; enhancements to customer products and services and their underlying performance characteristics; technology advancements; market share; peer comparisons; and the performance of recently acquired businesses.\nOn October 21, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Steuben Trust Corporation ( Steuben\u201d), parent company of Steuben Trust Company, a New York State chartered bank headquartered in Hornell, New York, for approximately $104.4 million in Company stock and cash. Steuben currently operates 14 branch locations in Western New York. The acquisition will extend the Company's footprint into two new counties in Western New York State and enhance the Company's presence in four Western New York State counties in which it currently operates. The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020, pending both customary regulatory and Steuben shareholder approval. The Company expects to incur certain one-time, transaction-related costs in 2020 in connection with the Steuben acquisition.\nOn September 18, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, Community Investment Services, Inc. ( CISI\u201d), completed its acquisition of certain assets of a practice engaged in the financial services business headquartered in Syracuse, New York. The Company paid $0.5 million in cash to acquire a customer list, and recorded a $0.5 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Company completed its merger with Kinderhook Bank Corp. ( Kinderhook\u201d), parent company of The National Union Bank of Kinderhook, headquartered in Kinderhook, New York, for $93.4 million in cash. The merger added 11 branch locations across a five county area in the Capital District of Upstate New York. The merger resulted in the acquisition of $642.8 million of assets, including $479.9 million of loans and $39.8 million of investment securities, as well as $568.2 million of deposits and $40.3 million in goodwill.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, CISI, completed its acquisition of certain assets of Wealth Resources Network, Inc. ( Wealth Resources\u201d), a financial services business headquartered in Liverpool, New York. The Company paid $1.2 million in cash to acquire a customer list from Wealth Resources, and recorded a $1.2 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nThe Company reported net income of $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 that was 0.3% above the prior year, while earnings per share of $3.23 for the year was 0.3% below the prior year. The increase in net income was due in part to the expanded business activities from the Kinderhook acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2019. Contributing to the increase in net income was an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses, an increase in gain on sales of investment securities, higher noninterest revenues and lower income taxes. Partially offsetting these items were an increase in acquisition expenses, an increase in noninterest expenses and an increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding attributable to shares issued in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. Net income adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Net Income\u201d), increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Earnings per share adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Earnings Per Share\u201d), of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe Company experienced year-over-year growth in average interest-earning assets, primarily reflective of the Kinderhook acquisition completed in July 2019. Average deposits increased in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflective of organic growth and the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition. Average external borrowings in 2019 decreased from 2018 reflective of a decrease in securities sold under an agreement to repurchase ( customer repurchase agreements\u201d) as well as a decrease in overnight borrowings and a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT Statutory Trust I ( MBVT I\u201d) and the Kinderhook Capital Trust ( KCT\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by subordinated debt acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. Asset quality in 2019 remained stable and favorable in comparison to the end of 2018, with nonperforming loan ratios, the delinquency ratio and the full year net charge-off ratio at December 31, 2019 all improved from one year earlier.\nNet Income and Profitability\nNet income for 2019 was $169.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.3%, from 2018's earnings. Earnings per share for 2019 was $3.23, down $0.01, or 0.3%, from 2018's results. Net income and earnings per share for 2019 were impacted by $8.6 million of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, while the Company recovered $0.8 million of vendor contract termination charges in 2018 that were initially recorded as an acquisition expense in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nNet income for 2018 was $168.6 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 11.9%, from 2017's earnings, while earnings per share for 2018 was $3.24, up $0.21, or 6.9%. The 2018 results included the aforementioned $0.8 million recovery of vendor contract termination charges, while the 2017 results included $26.0 million, or $0.37 per share, of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Merchants and NRS acquisitions. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.39 in 2018 increased $0.59, or 21.1%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nTable 1: Condensed Income Statements\n\nThe Company operates in three business segments: Banking, Employee Benefit Services and All Other. The banking segment provides a wide array of lending and depository-related products and services to individuals, businesses and municipal enterprises. In addition to these general intermediation services, the Banking segment provides treasury management solutions and payment processing services. Employee Benefit Services, consisting of BPAS and its subsidiaries, provides the following on a national basis: employee benefit trust services; collective investment fund; fund administration, transfer agency; retirement plan and VEBA/HRA and health savings account plan administration services; actuarial services; and healthcare consulting services. BPAS services more than 3,800 benefit plans with approximately 450,000 plan participants and holds more than $89.3 billion in employee benefit trust assets. In addition, BPAS employs 370 professionals located in 18 states, and occupies 11 offices located in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Puerto Rico. The All Other segment is comprised of wealth management and insurance services. Wealth management activities include trust services provided by the personal trust unit of CBNA, investment products and services provided by CISI and The Carta Group, Inc. ( The Carta Group\u201d), and asset advisory services provided by Nottingham Advisors, Inc. ( Nottingham\u201d). The insurance services activities include the offerings of personal and commercial property insurance and other risk management products and services provided by OneGroup NY, Inc. ( OneGroup\u201d). For additional financial information on the Company's segments, refer to Note U - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe primary factors explaining 2019 earnings performance are discussed in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized by segment as follows:\nBANKING\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $13.8 million, or 4.0%. This was the result of a $295.4 million increase in average interest earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loans grew $278.9 million driven primarily by the Kinderhook acquisition, and the yield on loans increased 15 basis points from the prior year. Also contributing to the growth in interest income was a $16.6 million increase in the average book value of investments, including cash equivalents. The increase in the average book balance of investments was the net result of investment purchases of $810.1 million in investment purchases during the year and $39.8 million of investments acquired with the Kinderhook transaction, partially offset by $209.9 million in investment maturities, calls and principal payments, as well as the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities. The average yield on investments, including cash equivalents, was consistent with the prior year at 2.58%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $178.5 million due primarily to the addition of deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Borrowing interest expense decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in average balances of $81.0 million, or 19.8%, partially offset by a blended rate that was 14 basis points higher than the prior year. \n \u2022 The loan loss provision of $8.4 million decreased $2.4 million, or 22.2%, from the prior year level. Net charge-offs of $7.8 million were $1.3 million less than 2018. This resulted in an annual net charge-off ratio (net charge-offs / total average loans) of 0.12%, which was three basis points lower than the prior year. Year-end nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned both decreased five basis points compared to December 31, 2018 levels. Additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages 44 through 48. \n \u2022 Banking noninterest revenue for 2019, excluding unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and gain on sales of investment securities, of $70.5 million decreased by $4.9 million from 2018's level. The decrease in noninterest revenue included an $0.11 per diluted share impact on deposit service fees due to the debit interchange fee limitations established by the Durbin amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Durbin amendment\u201d) that were effective for the Company beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This negative impact of the Durbin amendment was partially offset by an increase in the volume of deposit services fees related to deposit relationships acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. \n \u2022 Total banking noninterest expenses, including acquisition expenses, increased $23.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2019 reflective of the $8.6 million in one-time acquisition expenses incurred in 2019, additional expenses associated with an expanded branch network from the Kinderhook acquisition, as well as continued investment in risk management initiatives, business development and marketing, technology and data processing costs. Excluding acquisition expenses, banking noninterest expenses increased $13.8 million, or 5.8%. \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT SERVICES\n \u2022 Employee benefit services noninterest revenue for 2019 of $99.5 million increased $5.0 million, or 5.3%, from the prior year level, due to the organic growth and an increase in employee benefit trust assets. \n \u2022 Employee benefit services noninterest expenses for 2019 totaled $66.2 million. This represented an increase from 2018 of $1.9 million, or 3.0%, and was attributable to an increase in personnel costs associated with the continued buildout of resources to support an expanding revenue base. \nALL OTHER (WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE SERVICES)\n \u2022 Wealth management and insurance services noninterest revenue for 2019 was $59.1 million; an increase of $1.9 million from the prior year level. The increase was primarily due to organic growth in revenue from insurance products and services provided by OneGroup. Also contributing to the increase was modest growth in wealth management revenue from organic and acquired sources, including the expansion of operations resulting from the two wealth management related acquisitions completed in 2019. \n \u2022 Wealth management and insurance services noninterest expenses of $48.6 million increased $1.6 million, or 3.5%, from 2018 primarily due to increased personnel and data processing costs associated with the aforementioned organic and acquired growth. \nSelected Profitability and Other Measures\nReturn on average assets, return on average equity, dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows:\nTable 2: Selected Ratios\n\nAs displayed in Table 2, the 2019 return on average assets ratio decreased five basis points and the return on average equity ratio decreased 78 basis points as compared to 2018. The decrease in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in average assets, primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, which outpaced the increase in net income that was impacted by $8.6 million in acquisition expenses incurred in 2019. The return on average equity ratio decreased in 2019 as the increase in average equity outpaced net income that was impacted by the aforementioned acquisition expenses. The return on average assets ratio in 2018 increased nine basis points, while the return on average equity ratio decreased one basis point as compared to 2017. The increase in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in net income, reflective of a full year of activities from the Merchants and NRS transactions, which outpaced the increase in average assets. The return on average equity ratio decreased slightly in 2018 as the increase in average equity due primarily to the impact of the shares issued for the Merchants and NRS acquisitions and earnings retention slightly outpaced the increase in net income. The return on average assets adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased two basis points to 1.63% in 2019, as compared to 1.65% in 2018. The return on average equity adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased 61 basis points to 10.03% in 2019, from 10.64% in 2018. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe dividend payout ratio for 2019 increased 4.6% from 2018 as the 10.7% increase in dividends declared from 2018 was higher than the 0.3% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2019 was a result of a 9.7% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. The dividend payout ratio for 2018 increased 0.3% from 2017 as the 12.7% increase in dividends declared from 2017 was modestly higher than the 11.9% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2018 was a result of a 9.1% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan.\nThe average equity to average assets ratio continued to increase in 2019 as the growth in common shareholders' equity outpaced the growth in assets. During 2019, average equity increased 8.5% while average assets increased at a rate of 3.5%. In 2018 average equity rose 12.0% and average assets grew 5.7% in comparison to 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the amount by which interest and fees on earning assets (loans, investments and cash equivalents) exceeds the cost of funds, which consists primarily of interest paid to the Company's depositors and interest on borrowings. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of earning assets.\nAs disclosed in Table 3, net interest income (with nontaxable income converted to a fully tax-equivalent basis) totaled $363.2 million in 2019, an increase of $13.8 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year. The increase is a result of a $295.4 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. As reflected in Table 4, the favorable impact of the increase in interest-earning assets ($11.8 million) and increase in the yield ($10.9 million) was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the increase in interest-bearing liabilities ($0.3 million) and the higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities ($8.6 million).\nThe 2019 net interest margin increased three basis points to 3.76% from 3.73% reported in 2018. The increase was attributable to an 11 basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a 13 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.73% yield on loans increased 15 basis points in 2019 as compared to 4.58% in 2018, including the impact of acquired loan accretion associated with the Kinderhook acquisition. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, of 2.58% in 2019 was consistent with 2018. The yield on investments included the impact of the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities in the second quarter of 2019 with subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds occurring primarily in the fourth quarter. The proceeds from the sale of securities in the second quarter were held in interest-earning cash until more attractive reinvestment options became available in the fourth quarter. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.40% during 2019 as compared to 0.27% for 2018. The increased cost reflects the 10 basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 14 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2019.\nThe net interest margin in 2018 increased four basis points to 3.73% from 3.69% reported in 2017. The increase was attributable to an eight basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a five basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.58% yield on loans increased 19 basis points in 2018 as compared to 4.39% in 2017, including the impact of incremental acquired loan accretion on the Merchants portfolio. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, decreased from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This lower yield on investments is reflective of maturing higher rate investments being replaced with lower-yielding securities and interest-earning cash, as well as the result of a lower fully tax-equivalent adjustment due to the lower federal tax rate associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.27% during 2018 as compared to 0.22% for 2017. The increased cost reflects the three basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 21 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2018.\nAs shown in Table 3, total FTE-basis interest income increased by $22.7 million, or 6.2%, in 2019 in comparison to 2018. Table 4 indicates that a higher average earning-asset balance created $11.8 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $10.9 million on interest income. Average loans increased $278.9 million, or 4.5%, in 2019. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Kinderhook acquisition, which accounted for $217.6 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $22.1 million, or 7.7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, attributable to the higher average balances and a 15 basis point increase in the loan yield.\nInvestment interest income (FTE basis) in 2019 was $0.6 million, or 0.7%, higher than the prior year as a result of a $16.6 million increase in the average book basis balance of investments (including cash equivalents) and an average investment yield of 2.58% that was consistent with the prior year. The higher average investment book balance is inclusive of the $37.7 million of available-for-sale securities and $2.1 million of equity and other securities acquired with the Kinderhook transaction.\nTotal interest income in 2018 increased $28.2 million, or 8.3%, from 2017's level. As shown in table 4, the higher average earning-asset balance created $21.6 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $6.6 million on interest income. Average loans increased $445.5 million, or 7.7%, in 2018. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Merchants acquisition, which accounted for $351.9 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $31.8 million, or 12.5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, attributable to the higher average balances and a 19 basis point increase in the loan yield. On a FTE basis, investment interest income, including interest on cash equivalents, totaled $80.0 million in 2018, $3.6 million, or 4.3%, lower than the prior year as a result of a 21 basis point decrease in the average investment yield from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This decrease in yield was partially offset by a $108.2 million, or 3.6%, higher average book basis balance (including cash equivalents) for 2018 versus the prior year. The lower average investment yield in 2018 was reflective of cash flows from higher rate maturing instruments in the investment portfolio being reinvested at lower interest rates or held in interest-earning cash.\nTotal interest expense increased by $8.9 million, or 50.2%, to $26.6 million in 2019. As shown in Table 4, higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of $8.6 million, while higher deposit balances resulted in a $0.3 million increase in interest expense. Interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets for 2019 increased eight basis points to 0.27%. The rate on interest-bearing deposits of 0.32% was 15 basis points higher than 2018, primarily due to an increase in certain product rates in response to changes in market interest rates during 2018 and 2019. The rate on borrowings increased 14 basis points to 1.86% in 2019, primarily due to the increase in the average variable rate paid on subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts and overnight borrowings. Total average funding balances (deposits and borrowings) in 2019 increased $196.1 million, or 2.2%. Average deposits increased $277.1 million, with $260.0 million of the increase from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average non-time ( core\u201d) deposit balances increased $184.9 million and accounted for 90.3% of total average deposits compared to 91.1% in 2018, due to the addition of $185.9 million in core deposit balances with the Kinderhook acquisition, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in legacy deposits. Average time deposits increased by $92.2 million year-over-year, including $74.1 million in average time deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average time deposits represented 9.7% of total average deposits for 2019 compared to 8.9% in 2018. Average external borrowings decreased $81.0 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to a decrease in average customer repurchase agreements of $42.6 million, a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts of $20.1 million and a decrease in FHLB borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average subordinated notes payable of $6.5 million associated with subordinated notes acquired in the Kinderhook transaction. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT I and the KCT during the third quarter of 2019 for a total of $22.7 million, offset by a partial year of subordinated debt acquired", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the past two years, although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with SEC disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long-term trends. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Information beginning on page 26 and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that appear on pages 60 through 111. All references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations refer to the consolidated position and results of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.\nUnless otherwise noted, all earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) figures disclosed in the MD&A refer to diluted EPS; interest income, net interest income, and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax-equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The term this year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year 2019, last year\u201d and equivalent terms refer to calendar year 2018, and all references to income statement results correspond to full-year activity unless otherwise noted.\nThis MD&A contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of the Company. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements are set herein under the caption Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 54.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company's business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but also reflects management's discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company's financial performance. It is management's opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include the allowance for loan losses, actuarial assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit plans, the provision for income taxes, investment valuation and other-than-temporary impairment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and acquired loan valuations. A summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note A, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, starting on page 65.\nSupplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations\nThe Company also provides supplemental reporting of its results on an operating,\u201d adjusted net\u201d or tangible\u201d basis, from which it excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts), accretion on non-impaired purchased loans, acquisition expenses, the unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and the one-time benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Although adjusted net income\u201d as defined by the Company is a non-GAAP measure, the Company's management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisitions and other non-recurring activity in its reported results. Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in Table 20.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services to retail, commercial and municipal customers. The Company's banking subsidiary is Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank\u201d or CBNA\u201d). The Company also provides employee benefit and trust related services via its Benefit Plans Administrative Services, Inc. ( BPAS\u201d) subsidiary, and wealth management and insurance-related services.\nThe Company's core operating objectives are: (i) grow the branch network, primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy, and certain selective de novo expansions, (ii) build profitable loan and deposit volume using both organic and acquisition strategies, (iii) manage an investment securities portfolio to complement the Company's loan and deposit strategies and optimize interest rate risk, yield and liquidity, (iv) increase the noninterest component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income, growth in existing financial services business units, and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses, and (v) utilize technology to deliver customer-responsive products and services and improve efficiencies.\nSignificant factors reviewed by management to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share; return on assets and equity; components of net interest margin; noninterest revenues; noninterest expenses; asset quality; loan and deposit growth; capital management; performance of individual banking and financial services units; performance of specific product lines and customers; liquidity and interest rate sensitivity; enhancements to customer products and services and their underlying performance characteristics; technology advancements; market share; peer comparisons; and the performance of recently acquired businesses.\nOn October 21, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Steuben Trust Corporation ( Steuben\u201d), parent company of Steuben Trust Company, a New York State chartered bank headquartered in Hornell, New York, for approximately $104.4 million in Company stock and cash. Steuben currently operates 14 branch locations in Western New York. The acquisition will extend the Company's footprint into two new counties in Western New York State and enhance the Company's presence in four Western New York State counties in which it currently operates. The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020, pending both customary regulatory and Steuben shareholder approval. The Company expects to incur certain one-time, transaction-related costs in 2020 in connection with the Steuben acquisition.\nOn September 18, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, Community Investment Services, Inc. ( CISI\u201d), completed its acquisition of certain assets of a practice engaged in the financial services business headquartered in Syracuse, New York. The Company paid $0.5 million in cash to acquire a customer list, and recorded a $0.5 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Company completed its merger with Kinderhook Bank Corp. ( Kinderhook\u201d), parent company of The National Union Bank of Kinderhook, headquartered in Kinderhook, New York, for $93.4 million in cash. The merger added 11 branch locations across a five county area in the Capital District of Upstate New York. The merger resulted in the acquisition of $642.8 million of assets, including $479.9 million of loans and $39.8 million of investment securities, as well as $568.2 million of deposits and $40.3 million in goodwill.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, CISI, completed its acquisition of certain assets of Wealth Resources Network, Inc. ( Wealth Resources\u201d), a financial services business headquartered in Liverpool, New York. The Company paid $1.2 million in cash to acquire a customer list from Wealth Resources, and recorded a $1.2 million customer list intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition.\nThe Company reported net income of $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 that was 0.3% above the prior year, while earnings per share of $3.23 for the year was 0.3% below the prior year. The increase in net income was due in part to the expanded business activities from the Kinderhook acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2019. Contributing to the increase in net income was an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses, an increase in gain on sales of investment securities, higher noninterest revenues and lower income taxes. Partially offsetting these items were an increase in acquisition expenses, an increase in noninterest expenses and an increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding attributable to shares issued in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. Net income adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Net Income\u201d), increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Earnings per share adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles and acquired non-impaired loan accretion ( Adjusted Earnings Per Share\u201d), of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe Company experienced year-over-year growth in average interest-earning assets, primarily reflective of the Kinderhook acquisition completed in July 2019. Average deposits increased in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflective of organic growth and the impact of the Kinderhook acquisition. Average external borrowings in 2019 decreased from 2018 reflective of a decrease in securities sold under an agreement to repurchase ( customer repurchase agreements\u201d) as well as a decrease in overnight borrowings and a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT Statutory Trust I ( MBVT I\u201d) and the Kinderhook Capital Trust ( KCT\u201d) during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by subordinated debt acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. Asset quality in 2019 remained stable and favorable in comparison to the end of 2018, with nonperforming loan ratios, the delinquency ratio and the full year net charge-off ratio at December 31, 2019 all improved from one year earlier.\nNet Income and Profitability\nNet income for 2019 was $169.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.3%, from 2018's earnings. Earnings per share for 2019 was $3.23, down $0.01, or 0.3%, from 2018's results. Net income and earnings per share for 2019 were impacted by $8.6 million of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, while the Company recovered $0.8 million of vendor contract termination charges in 2018 that were initially recorded as an acquisition expense in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income increased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.44 increased $0.05, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nNet income for 2018 was $168.6 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 11.9%, from 2017's earnings, while earnings per share for 2018 was $3.24, up $0.21, or 6.9%. The 2018 results included the aforementioned $0.8 million recovery of vendor contract termination charges, while the 2017 results included $26.0 million, or $0.37 per share, of acquisition expenses primarily related to the Merchants and NRS acquisitions. Adjusted Earnings per Share of $3.39 in 2018 increased $0.59, or 21.1%, compared to the prior year.

The banking segment provides a wide array of lending and depository-related products and services to individuals, businesses and municipal enterprises. In addition to these general intermediation services, the Banking segment provides treasury management solutions and payment processing services. Employee Benefit Services, consisting of BPAS and its subsidiaries, provides the following on a national basis: employee benefit trust services; collective investment fund; fund administration, transfer agency; retirement plan and VEBA/HRA and health savings account plan administration services; actuarial services; and healthcare consulting services. BPAS services more than 3,800 benefit plans with approximately 450,000 plan participants and holds more than $89.3 billion in employee benefit trust assets. In addition, BPAS employs 370 professionals located in 18 states, and occupies 11 offices located in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Puerto Rico. The All Other segment is comprised of wealth management and insurance services. Wealth management activities include trust services provided by the personal trust unit of CBNA, investment products and services provided by CISI and The Carta Group, Inc. ( The Carta Group\u201d), and asset advisory services provided by Nottingham Advisors, Inc. ( Nottingham\u201d). The insurance services activities include the offerings of personal and commercial property insurance and other risk management products and services provided by OneGroup NY, Inc. ( OneGroup\u201d). For additional financial information on the Company's segments, refer to Note U - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe primary factors explaining 2019 earnings performance are discussed in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized by segment as follows:\nBANKING\n \u2022 Net interest income increased $13.8 million, or 4.0%. This was the result of a $295.4 million increase in average interest earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. Average loans grew $278.9 million driven primarily by the Kinderhook acquisition, and the yield on loans increased 15 basis points from the prior year. Also contributing to the growth in interest income was a $16.6 million increase in the average book value of investments, including cash equivalents. The increase in the average book balance of investments was the net result of investment purchases of $810.1 million in investment purchases during the year and $39.8 million of investments acquired with the Kinderhook transaction, partially offset by $209.9 million in investment maturities, calls and principal payments, as well as the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities. The average yield on investments, including cash equivalents, was consistent with the prior year at 2.58%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $178.5 million due primarily to the addition of deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Borrowing interest expense decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in average balances of $81.0 million, or 19.8%, partially offset by a blended rate that was 14 basis points higher than the prior year. \n \u2022 The loan loss provision of $8.4 million decreased $2.4 million, or 22.2%, from the prior year level. Net charge-offs of $7.8 million were $1.3 million less than 2018. This resulted in an annual net charge-off ratio (net charge-offs / total average loans) of 0.12%, which was three basis points lower than the prior year. Year-end nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned both decreased five basis points compared to December 31, 2018 levels. Additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages 44 through 48. \n \u2022 Banking noninterest revenue for 2019, excluding unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment and gain on sales of investment securities, of $70.5 million decreased by $4.9 million from 2018's level. The decrease in noninterest revenue included an $0.11 per diluted share impact on deposit service fees due to the debit interchange fee limitations established by the Durbin amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Durbin amendment\u201d) that were effective for the Company beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This negative impact of the Durbin amendment was partially offset by an increase in the volume of deposit services fees related to deposit relationships acquired with the Kinderhook transaction. \n \u2022 Total banking noninterest expenses, including acquisition expenses, increased $23.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2019 reflective of the $8.6 million in one-time acquisition expenses incurred in 2019, additional expenses associated with an expanded branch network from the Kinderhook acquisition, as well as continued investment in risk management initiatives, business development and marketing, technology and data processing costs. Excluding acquisition expenses, banking noninterest expenses increased $13.8 million, or 5.8%. \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT SERVICES\n \u2022 Employee benefit services noninterest revenue for 2019 of $99.5 million increased $5.0 million, or 5.3%, from the prior year level, due to the organic growth and an increase in employee benefit trust assets. \n \u2022 Employee benefit services noninterest expenses for 2019 totaled $66.2 million. This represented an increase from 2018 of $1.9 million, or 3.0%, and was attributable to an increase in personnel costs associated with the continued buildout of resources to support an expanding revenue base. \nALL OTHER (WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE SERVICES)\n \u2022 Wealth management and insurance services noninterest revenue for 2019 was $59.1 million; an increase of $1.9 million from the prior year level. The increase was primarily due to organic growth in revenue from insurance products and services provided by OneGroup. Also contributing to the increase was modest growth in wealth management revenue from organic and acquired sources, including the expansion of operations resulting from the two wealth management related acquisitions completed in 2019. \n \u2022 Wealth management and insurance services noninterest expenses of $48.6 million increased $1.6 million, or 3.5%, from 2018 primarily due to increased personnel and data processing costs associated with the aforementioned organic and acquired growth. \nSelected Profitability and Other Measures\nReturn on average assets, return on average equity, dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows:\nTable 2: Selected Ratios\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend payout ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average equity to average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs displayed in Table 2, the 2019 return on average assets ratio decreased five basis points and the return on average equity ratio decreased 78 basis points as compared to 2018. The decrease in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in average assets, primarily related to the Kinderhook acquisition, which outpaced the increase in net income that was impacted by $8.6 million in acquisition expenses incurred in 2019. The return on average equity ratio decreased in 2019 as the increase in average equity outpaced net income that was impacted by the aforementioned acquisition expenses. The return on average assets ratio in 2018 increased nine basis points, while the return on average equity ratio decreased one basis point as compared to 2017. The increase in return on average assets was primarily the result of an increase in net income, reflective of a full year of activities from the Merchants and NRS transactions, which outpaced the increase in average assets. The return on average equity ratio decreased slightly in 2018 as the increase in average equity due primarily to the impact of the shares issued for the Merchants and NRS acquisitions and earnings retention slightly outpaced the increase in net income. The return on average assets adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased two basis points to 1.63% in 2019, as compared to 1.65% in 2018. The return on average equity adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses, gain on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain on equity securities, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of intangibles, and acquired non-impaired loan accretion decreased 61 basis points to 10.03% in 2019, from 10.64% in 2018. See Table 20 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\nThe dividend payout ratio for 2019 increased 4.6% from 2018 as the 10.7% increase in dividends declared from 2018 was higher than the 0.3% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2019 was a result of a 9.7% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan. The dividend payout ratio for 2018 increased 0.3% from 2017 as the 12.7% increase in dividends declared from 2017 was modestly higher than the 11.9% increase in net income. The increase in dividends declared in 2018 was a result of a 9.1% increase in the dividends declared per share and the issuance of shares in connection with the administration of the Company's 401(k) plan and employee stock plan.\nThe average equity to average assets ratio continued to increase in 2019 as the growth in common shareholders' equity outpaced the growth in assets. During 2019, average equity increased 8.5% while average assets increased at a rate of 3.5%. In 2018 average equity rose 12.0% and average assets grew 5.7% in comparison to 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the amount by which interest and fees on earning assets (loans, investments and cash equivalents) exceeds the cost of funds, which consists primarily of interest paid to the Company's depositors and interest on borrowings. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of earning assets.\nAs disclosed in Table 3, net interest income (with nontaxable income converted to a fully tax-equivalent basis) totaled $363.2 million in 2019, an increase of $13.8 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year. The increase is a result of a $295.4 million, or 3.2%, increase in average interest-earning assets and an 11 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $97.5 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 13 basis point increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. As reflected in Table 4, the favorable impact of the increase in interest-earning assets ($11.8 million) and increase in the yield ($10.9 million) was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the increase in interest-bearing liabilities ($0.3 million) and the higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities ($8.6 million).\nThe 2019 net interest margin increased three basis points to 3.76% from 3.73% reported in 2018. The increase was attributable to an 11 basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a 13 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.73% yield on loans increased 15 basis points in 2019 as compared to 4.58% in 2018, including the impact of acquired loan accretion associated with the Kinderhook acquisition. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, of 2.58% in 2019 was consistent with 2018. The yield on investments included the impact of the sale of $590.2 million of available-for-sale Treasury securities in the second quarter of 2019 with subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds occurring primarily in the fourth quarter. The proceeds from the sale of securities in the second quarter were held in interest-earning cash until more attractive reinvestment options became available in the fourth quarter. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.40% during 2019 as compared to 0.27% for 2018. The increased cost reflects the 10 basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 14 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2019.\nThe net interest margin in 2018 increased four basis points to 3.73% from 3.69% reported in 2017. The increase was attributable to an eight basis point increase in the earning-asset yield, offset by a five basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The 4.58% yield on loans increased 19 basis points in 2018 as compared to 4.39% in 2017, including the impact of incremental acquired loan accretion on the Merchants portfolio. The yield on investments, including cash equivalents, decreased from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This lower yield on investments is reflective of maturing higher rate investments being replaced with lower-yielding securities and interest-earning cash, as well as the result of a lower fully tax-equivalent adjustment due to the lower federal tax rate associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.27% during 2018 as compared to 0.22% for 2017. The increased cost reflects the three basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and the 21 basis point higher average rate paid on borrowings in 2018.\nAs shown in Table 3, total FTE-basis interest income increased by $22.7 million, or 6.2%, in 2019 in comparison to 2018. Table 4 indicates that a higher average earning-asset balance created $11.8 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $10.9 million on interest income. Average loans increased $278.9 million, or 4.5%, in 2019. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Kinderhook acquisition, which accounted for $217.6 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $22.1 million, or 7.7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, attributable to the higher average balances and a 15 basis point increase in the loan yield.\nInvestment interest income (FTE basis) in 2019 was $0.6 million, or 0.7%, higher than the prior year as a result of a $16.6 million increase in the average book basis balance of investments (including cash equivalents) and an average investment yield of 2.58% that was consistent with the prior year. The higher average investment book balance is inclusive of the $37.7 million of available-for-sale securities and $2.1 million of equity and other securities acquired with the Kinderhook transaction.\nTotal interest income in 2018 increased $28.2 million, or 8.3%, from 2017's level. As shown in table 4, the higher average earning-asset balance created $21.6 million of incremental interest income and a higher yield on earning assets had a favorable impact of $6.6 million on interest income. Average loans increased $445.5 million, or 7.7%, in 2018. This increase was primarily due to acquired growth from the Merchants acquisition, which accounted for $351.9 million of the growth. FTE-basis loan interest income and fees increased $31.8 million, or 12.5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, attributable to the higher average balances and a 19 basis point increase in the loan yield. On a FTE basis, investment interest income, including interest on cash equivalents, totaled $80.0 million in 2018, $3.6 million, or 4.3%, lower than the prior year as a result of a 21 basis point decrease in the average investment yield from 2.79% in 2017 to 2.58% in 2018. This decrease in yield was partially offset by a $108.2 million, or 3.6%, higher average book basis balance (including cash equivalents) for 2018 versus the prior year. The lower average investment yield in 2018 was reflective of cash flows from higher rate maturing instruments in the investment portfolio being reinvested at lower interest rates or held in interest-earning cash.\nTotal interest expense increased by $8.9 million, or 50.2%, to $26.6 million in 2019. As shown in Table 4, higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of $8.6 million, while higher deposit balances resulted in a $0.3 million increase in interest expense. Interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets for 2019 increased eight basis points to 0.27%. The rate on interest-bearing deposits of 0.32% was 15 basis points higher than 2018, primarily due to an increase in certain product rates in response to changes in market interest rates during 2018 and 2019. The rate on borrowings increased 14 basis points to 1.86% in 2019, primarily due to the increase in the average variable rate paid on subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts and overnight borrowings. Total average funding balances (deposits and borrowings) in 2019 increased $196.1 million, or 2.2%. Average deposits increased $277.1 million, with $260.0 million of the increase from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average non-time ( core\u201d) deposit balances increased $184.9 million and accounted for 90.3% of total average deposits compared to 91.1% in 2018, due to the addition of $185.9 million in core deposit balances with the Kinderhook acquisition, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in legacy deposits. Average time deposits increased by $92.2 million year-over-year, including $74.1 million in average time deposits from the Kinderhook acquisition. Average time deposits represented 9.7% of total average deposits for 2019 compared to 8.9% in 2018. Average external borrowings decreased $81.0 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to a decrease in average customer repurchase agreements of $42.6 million, a decrease in subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts of $20.1 million and a decrease in FHLB borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average subordinated notes payable of $6.5 million associated with subordinated notes acquired in the Kinderhook transaction. The decrease in average subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts is due to the redemption of trust preferred debt held by MBVT I and the KCT during the third quarter of 2019 for a total of $22.7 million, offset by a partial year of subordinated debt acquired"}
