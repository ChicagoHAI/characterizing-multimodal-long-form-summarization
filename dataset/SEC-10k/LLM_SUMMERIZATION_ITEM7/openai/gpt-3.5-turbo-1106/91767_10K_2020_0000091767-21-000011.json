Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to the Company's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with approximately 320 locations in 34 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, in 2020 approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 6% in Asia, 4% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in uncoated recycled paperboard, tubes, cores, cones and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nCOVID-19\nImpact on Operating Results\nAround the world, Sonoco is an essential provider of consumer, industrial and medical packaging. Sonoco associates are deemed Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\u201d under the guidance of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and have received similar designations by the vast majority of other governmental agencies in the 34 countries where the Company operates. As a result, nearly all of the Company's global operations were able to continue to operate despite locally-mandated temporary shutdown orders that were issued in many of our geographic locations. Certain customers whose products were not deemed critically essential\u201d had to temporarily suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while some others had time periods when they were unable to fully staff their operations. As areas around the world have largely reopened their economies, the Company has seen improved demand for many of its products and services. However, recent indications of a resurgence of the virus in certain regions and the emergence of variants of the virus for which existing vaccines could be less effective have raised concerns about the re-imposition of local restrictions on business activity and a negative effect on consumer behavior that alone, or together, could impede the economic recovery. Sonoco is following these developments closely and will respond with appropriate changes to active production capacity and cost-management initiatives. An extended period of disruption to our served markets or global supply chains could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition. In addition, an extended global recession caused by the pandemic would have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial condition.\nWhile the social distancing response to COVID-19 has resulted in increased consumer demand for certain food and household products, the pandemic's recessionary impact on the worldwide economy has significantly decreased demand in our more economically sensitive industrial related businesses and exacerbated their negative price/cost relationships. As a result, the overall impact of the pandemic on 2020 consolidated results was negative. While we expect the pandemic to continue having a mixed impact on demand for our products in 2021, we expect that demand and mix across our businesses will largely revert to pre-pandemic levels over the course of the year. However, although we expect that, relative to 2020, consolidated results will benefit from this reversion, we still expect a net negative impact to 2021 consolidated earnings relative to pre-pandemic levels and that many of our businesses will continue to experience negative price/cost pressure.\nWe expect our Consumer Packaging segment to experience normal seasonal volume trends in 2021 and to perform well relative to pre-pandemic levels. However, as the pandemic wanes, total volume is expected to be flat year over year as sales of at-home food packaging decline and demand in other consumer market segments picks up. We expect our industrial-related markets to continue experiencing weak but improving demand into the summer or fall, with our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment continuing to face a negative price/cost relationship due to higher year-over-year recycled fiber costs; however, we expect industrial demand will improve more substantially over the back-half of the year if the pandemic continues to subside. Our Protective Solutions and Display and Packaging businesses are expected to benefit from the continued economic recovery.\nFinancial Flexibility and Liquidity\nSonoco has a strong, investment-grade balance sheet and substantial liquidity available in the form of cash, cash equivalents and revolving credit facilities, as well as the ability to issue commercial paper and to access liquidity in the banking and debt capital markets. The following actions taken in 2020 largely related to the Company's efforts to either improve near-term liquidity or secure additional liquidity in light of volatility in the credit markets and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u2022On March 18, 2020, the Company closed and funded a new $150 million, 364-day term loan, the proceeds from which were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper. The Company repaid this loan on July 20, 2020.\n\u2022On April 1, 2020, the Company accessed $250 million from its revolving credit facility, using $85 million of the proceeds to fully repay its then outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company repaid this loan on May 5, 2020.\n\u2022On April 6, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million pursuant to a new 364-day term loan. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n\u2022On April 22, 2020, the Company sold $600 million of 3.125% notes due May 1, 2030, using a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of existing debt.\n\u2022In May 2020, the Company exercised its one-time option to extend the term of its 364-day, $200 million term loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to May 2021. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n20 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n\u2022On November 30, 2020, the Company repaid the remaining balance of its five-year term loan using proceeds from the sale of its European contract packaging business.\nFollowing the actions above, at December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $565 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, $500 million in committed availability under its revolving credit facility, and scheduled debt maturities in 2021 of approximately $456 million.\nHealth, Safety and Business Continuity\nThe health and safety of Sonoco's associates, contractors, suppliers and the general public are a top priority. Included among the safety measures we have recently implemented are: conducting health screenings for personnel entering our operations, routinely cleaning high-touch surfaces, following social distancing protocols, prohibiting all non-critical business travel, and encouraging all associates who can to work from home when possible. Additionally, Sonoco has launched a dedicated COVID-19 internal microsite to keep its associates up to date on Company and health authority information, guidelines, protocols and policies, including those set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSonoco has also put in place a Global Task Force to develop and implement business continuity plans to ensure its operations are as prepared as possible to be able to continue producing and shipping product to its customers without disruption. Sonoco has a diverse global supply chain and to date has not experienced significant raw material or other supply disruptions.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, non-operating pension costs, certain income tax events and adjustments, and other items, if any, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company consistently applies its non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein and uses them for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 24 and 25 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2020 overview and 2021 outlook\nManagement's primary focus areas in 2020 were profitable growth, improving margins, improving cash flow, and sustainability. Overall, management was expecting a notable increase in net sales, largely driven by the full-year impact of 2019 acquisitions, and modest improvements in overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Management had targeted an overall 2020 organic volume increase of approximately 1.0% and was expecting a negative price/cost relationship. Manufacturing and other productivity gains were expected to offset a significant portion of projected increases in labor and other costs.\nHowever, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, management's focus quickly turned to addressing the many unprecedented issues and challenges the pandemic presented, including protecting workers' safety, simultaneously accelerating production of products that experienced a surge in demand and scaling down operations producing products that experienced sharp declines, and managing the ensuing volatility in material costs and financial markets.\nAs noted above, the pandemic had wide-ranging impacts on the operations and financial results of our various businesses, both positive and negative. Despite the full-year benefit of 2019 acquisitions, overall sales declined 2.5%, reflecting reduced demand in our more economically sensitive industrial-related businesses, partially offset by increased demand in our Consumer Packaging segment, particularly food packaging.\nGAAP operating profit declined $109.3 million from the prior year largely driven by higher restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as a loss on the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business. In 2020, the Company recorded after-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges of $112.7 million, which were largely attributable to its perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations on the west coast of\n21 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nthe United States and in Mexico. Despite the decline in GAAP operating profit, total segment operating profit (referred to as base operating profit) was essentially unchanged from the prior year. A recession-induced decline in the Paper and Industrial Related Products segment was almost fully offset by an increase in Consumer Packaging operating profit driven by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand for certain food and household products. Overall, net productivity gains were able to offset lower volume as well as a negative price cost relationship.\nCurrent year gross profit was $1,046.3 million, compared with $1,057.8 million in 2019. Despite the small decline, gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 20.0%, compared to 19.7% in 2019. GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were relatively flat as decreases due to a focus on managing costs, together with the impact of the pandemic on travel, employee medical and other expenses were partially offset by additional SG&A expenses from acquired businesses.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2020 decreased 28.9%, or $84.3 million, from 5.4% of sales to 4.0% of sales, reflecting the decline in operating profit as well as higher net interest expense. Although base operating profit was essentially unchanged, base earnings attributable to Sonoco declined 3.3%, or $11.7 million, year over year, reflecting the higher net interest expense and a somewhat higher effective base income tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 20.7%, compared with 24.5% in 2019, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 25.1%, compared with 23.9% in 2019. The year-over-year decrease in the GAAP tax rate was driven primarily by the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business and a related write down of the deferred tax liability on goodwill. The increase in the effective tax rate on base earnings in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nOn August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands the Company's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. This transaction, and the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in January 2020, are described in greater detail below. On November 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its European contract packaging business which was a component of the Display and Packaging segment.\nOn July 17, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\") effective September 30, 2019. Approval of the termination was received from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in 2020. Following completion of a limited lump-sum offering, the Company is expected to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan through the purchases of annuities in mid 2021. In anticipation of settling these liabilities, the Company took measures beginning in 2019 to derisk the Inactive Plan's assets by investing them in a conservative mix of primarily fixed income investments. During 2020, the Company recorded total pension and postretirement benefit expenses of approximately $58.0 million, compared with $52.7 million during 2019. The increased expense was primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets as a result of a full year's impact of the derisking of the Inactive Plan portfolio. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans remained at $294 million at the end of both 2020 and 2019 as increases in plan liabilities from interest and lower discount rates were offset by increases in plan assets from Company contributions and investment returns.\nThe Company generated $705.6 million in cash from operations during 2020, compared with $425.9 million in 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the approximately $165 million after-tax voluntary contribution to the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. Cash generated from operations also improved due to the deferral of payments of the Company's portion of social security taxes pursuant to the CARES Act and a cash tax benefit generated by the expected funding in mid-2021 of the Inactive Plan as the obligations of the plan are settled.\nOutlook\nManaging through the pandemic will continue to be a primary focus in 2021; however, the Company also expects to drive profitable growth, expand gross profit margin and enhance sustainability in our operations and our product lines. Key to achieving management's objectives for 2021 and beyond will be a strategy to invest in ourselves and product markets where we have competitive advantages and can be value adding. A prime example of this strategy is the Company's $114 million investment in Project Horizon announced earlier in 2020, which will convert the Hartsville corrugated medium machine to be able to produce uncoated recycled paperboard. The scope of the project was expanded to include a finished goods warehouse and other infrastructure improvements to the Hartsville paper manufacturing complex. When completed in 2022, Project Horizon is estimated to drive approximately $30 million in annualized cost savings. In addition, the Company will work to further develop its previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2021 of approximately 2.0% driven largely by a continuation of the economic recovery and a steady return to pre-pandemic demand levels across our businesses. In addition, the Company expects to benefit from growth in chilled and prepared food volume, improved perimeter of the store performance, new sustainable products, and growth in our medical and retail security businesses. The Company will also continue to look for strategic and opportunistic acquisition candidates as well as opportunities to optimize our overall business portfolio.\nThe Company has projected that company-wide price/cost will be negative in 2021 due to higher year-over-year prices in key raw materials, such as recycled fiber and plastic resins, and higher freight costs. Manufacturing and other productivity gains are expected to offset a significant portion of the negative price/cost impact and projected increases in labor and other costs; however, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2021 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from the August 2020 Can Packaging acquisition, but will not include the revenue and profit of the European contract packaging business sold November 30, 2020; together, these items are estimated to have a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $240 million on revenue and a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $0.14 on diluted earnings per share.\nThe Company projects the operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense will be approximately $1 million higher year over year, while the non-operating component, excluding settlement charges, is projected to be $13 million lower. The net anticipated decrease of $12 million is due primarily to recognition of only a partial year of expenses related to the Inactive Plan which is expected to be fully settled by the end of the second quarter 2021. Non-cash, non-base, pretax settlement charges totaling approximately $560 million are expected to be recognized in 2021 as the liabilities of the Inactive Plan, terminated in 2019, are settled through lump-sum payouts and annuity purchases. The Company anticipates making an additional contribution to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in mid-2021 in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time of the annuity purchase. Contributions to all other defined benefit plans in 2021 are expected to total approximately $15 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported 2021 net sales will stay relatively flat at approximately $5.2 billion and overall margins for gross profit will improve approximately 0.8% over 2020. Base operating profit as a percent of sales is expected to remain at approximately 10.1%.\nCash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $585 million in 2021. Absent additional borrowings for acquisitions or significant changes in interest rates, net interest expense is expected to be lower year over year by approximately $12 million primarily due to lower average borrowing levels. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be approximately 25.4% in 2021 compared with 25.1% in 2020.\n22 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nAs noted below, the Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results. However, due to the magnitude of the pension settlement charges expected to be recognized in 2021, as described above, the Company anticipates it will report a GAAP net loss for the year.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2020 at a cost of $49.4 million, net of cash acquired. On August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a privately owned designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France, for $45.5 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This settlement occurred in January 2021 and resulted in the Company making an additional cash payment of approximately $1.6 million. Can Packaging operates two paper can manufacturing facilities in France, along with a research and development center where it designs and builds patented packaging machines and sealing equipment. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands Sonoco's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. The operations of Can Packaging are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On January 10, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in Jacksonville, Florida, from Design Containers, Inc. (\"Jacksonville\"), for total cash consideration of $4.0 million. The operations of Jacksonville are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2019 at a cost of $297.9 million, net of cash acquired. On December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Thermoform Engineered Quality, LLC, and Plastique Holdings, LTD, (together \"TEQ\") for $187.3 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing and resulted in the receipt of cash from the sellers totaling $0.2 million in April 2020. The acquired operations consist of three thermoforming and extrusion facilities in the United States along with a thermoforming operation in the United Kingdom and a thermoforming and molded-fiber operation in Poland, which together employ approximately 500 associates. The acquisition of TEQ provides a strong platform to further expand Sonoco's growing healthcare packaging business. The operations of TEQ are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On August 9, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Corenso for $110.6 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing which was settled in November 2019 requiring an additional cash payment to the sellers of approximately $0.1 million. Corenso is a leading manufacturer of uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) and high-performance cores used in the paper, packaging films, tape, and specialty industries. Corenso operates a 108,000-ton per year URB mill and core converting facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as a core converting facility in Richmond, Virginia, expanding the Company's ability to produce a wide variety of sustainable coreboard grades. The operations of Corenso are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company made final contingent payments totaling $3.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for acquisitions completed in prior years. In 2020 the Company settled a $2.5 million contingent purchase obligation related to the 2018 acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\") based on certain sales metrics being met and a $0.5 million contingent purchase liability related to the 2016 acquisition of AAR Corporation (\"AAR\"). In 2019 the Company settled additional contingent purchase obligations related to Highland and AAR totaling $5.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The payment of these contingent obligations are reflected as financing activities on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company completed the divestiture of its European contract packaging business, Sonoco Poland Packaging Services Sp. z.o.o. to a subsidiary of Prairie Industries Holdings, a Wisconsin-based contract packaging and contract manufacturing firm backed by The Halifax Group. These operations provided full-service custom packaging and supply chain management solutions to global consumer product goods companies from three locations in Poland with approximately 2,600 employees. The selling price of $120 million was adjusted at closing for certain indebtedness assumed by the buyer and for anticipated differences between targeted levels of working capital and the projected levels at the time of closing. The Company received net cash proceeds at closing of $105.9 million, with the buyer funding an escrow account with an additional $4.6 million, of which $4.0 million is expected to be released to the Company upon final sales adjustments in the first quarter of 2021, and the remainder, pending any indemnity claims, in the second quarter of 2022. The Company also anticipates that final working capital settlements will result in additional cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Transaction fees totaling $2.5 million were paid out of the proceeds received. Cumulative currency translation adjustment losses of $12.4 million associated with this entity were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a part of the net loss on the sale of the business which totaled $14.5 million. The decision to sell the European contract packaging business was part of the Company's efforts to simplify its operating structure to focus on growing its core Consumer and Industrial packaging businesses. The disposition of these operations is expected to negatively impact the 2021 year-over-year sales comparison by approximately $260 million. This sale is not expected to notably affect operating margin percentages nor does it represent a strategic shift for the Company that will have a major effect on its operations and financial results.\nThe Company continually assesses its operational footprint as well as its overall portfolio of businesses and may consider the disposition of plants and/or business units it considers to be suboptimal or nonstrategic. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\n23 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (approximately 320 locations in 34 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges for each of the years presented:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other asset impairments </td> <td>77,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring/Asset impairment charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, the Company announced the closures of a paper mill in Canada, a paper machine in the United States, a cone operation in Europe and four tube and core plants, one in Europe and three in the United States (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment); and the closure of a paperboard specialties plant in the United States (part of the Display and Packaging segment). Restructuring actions in the Consumer Packaging segment included the closure of two graphic design operations, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, and the consolidation in the Company's perimeter-of-the-store business operations on the west coast of the United States and in Mexico. This consolidation will result in the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United States and the conversion of a manufacturing facility in Mexico into a warehouse and distribution center. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized other asset impairments totaling $77.9 million on certain long-lived, intangible, and right of use assets, primarily in the Company's perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations. In addition, the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 275 positions.\nDuring 2019, the Company announced the elimination of a forming film production line at a flexible packaging facility in Illinois and initiated the closure of a composite can and injection molding facility in Germany, a composite can plant in Malaysia, a molded plastics plant in the United States (all part of the Consumer Packaging segment), and three tube and core plants - one in the United Kingdom, one in Norway, and one in Estonia (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment). Restructuring actions in the Protective Solutions segment included charges associated with the exit of a protective packaging facility in Texas. The Company recognized other asset impairment charges of $15.1 million in 2019 related to the impairment of certain assets within the temperature-assured packaging business and the impairment of certain assets and inventory associated with a plastic can business line in the United States. In addition, the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 223 positions.\nThe Company expects to recognize future additional costs totaling approximately $5 million in connection with previously announced restructuring actions. The Company believes that the majority of these charges will be incurred and paid by the end of 2020. The Company regularly evaluates its cost structure, including its manufacturing capacity, and additional restructuring actions are likely to be undertaken. Restructuring and asset impairment charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the Company operates.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about restructuring activities and asset impairment charges.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures\nThe

- 2020 versus 2019\nNet income attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) was $207.5 million ($2.05 per diluted share) in 2020, compared with $291.8 million ($2.88 per diluted share) in 2019.\nGAAP earnings in 2020 reflect net after-tax charges totaling $138.0 million, primarily related to restructuring and asset impairment charges, acquisition costs and non-operating pension costs. GAAP earnings in 2019 were negatively impacted by net after-tax charges totaling $65.4 million consisting of restructuring/asset impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by the favorable change in estimate of an environmental liability reserve.\nBase earnings in 2020 were $345.5 million ($3.41 per diluted share), compared with $357.2 million ($3.53 per diluted share) in 2019.\nBoth GAAP and base earnings in 2020 reflect volume/mix declines as a result of the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic positively affected sales demand in our Consumer segment, this positive impact only partially offset the negative impacts in our three other segments. Additionally, price/cost had a negative impact in most businesses, most notably in our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment as raw material prices increased during the year. These challenges were somewhat offset by total productivity gains as well as the year-over-year impact from acquisitions. Foreign currency translation had a minor negative impact on earnings year over year as well. GAAP earnings in 2020 were further unfavorably impacted by an $85.7 million increase in restructuring activity and a $5.4 million increase in non-operating pension costs.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 20.7% in 2020, compared with 24.5% in 2019, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 25.1%, compared with 23.9% in 2019. The year-over-year decrease in the GAAP tax rate was driven by the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business and related write down of goodwill. The increase in the effective tax rate on base earnings in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nConsolidated net sales for 2020 were $5.2 billion, a $137 million, or 2.5%, decrease from 2019. The components of the sales change were:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume/mix </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(131) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling price </td> <td>(36) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures, net </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation and other, net </td> <td>(80) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales decrease </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(137) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n25 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nSales volume/mix was down approximately 2.4% driven by decreases in each segment except for the Consumer Packaging segment. These decreases were largely due to the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the Consumer Packaging segment's food packaging product lines benefited from customers' preferences for at-home eating during the pandemic. Selling prices were slightly lower year over year in all segments except Display and Packaging. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $110 million to comparable year-over-year sales while foreign currency translation decreased year-over-year reported sales approximately $51 million as almost all of the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nTotal domestic sales were $3.4 billion, up 0.1% from 2019, as increases from domestic acquisitions and demand for the Company's consumer products were effectively offset by lower demand in other domestic businesses and lower selling prices. International sales were $1.8 billion, down 7.1%from 2019. The year-over-year decline in international sales was driven by lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by additional sales from acquisitions, net of dispositions.\nCosts and expenses/margins\nDespite the impact of acquisitions, cost of sales decreased $125.3 million in 2020, or 2.9%, from the prior year. This decrease was driven by lower volumes as well as foreign exchange rate changes and total productivity improvements. Gross profit margins increased to 20.0% in 2020 from 19.7% in the prior year driven by productivity.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 0.5%, and were 10.1% of sales compared to 9.9% of sales in 2019. The current year decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by a significant focus across the Company on lowering controllable costs as well as the impact of the pandemic on travel, employee medical and other expenses. These decreases in SG&A expenses were partially offset by the added expenses of acquired businesses.\nGAAP operating profit was 6.8% of sales in 2020 compared to 8.7% in 2019. Base operating profit increased to 10.1% of sales in 2020 compared to 9.8% in 2019. GAAP operating profit decreased $109.3 million and base operating profit increased $1.6 million. The decreases in 2020 GAAP operating profit and operating profit margin are largely attributable to an $85.7 million increase in restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as as a $14.5 million loss on the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business. The increased base operating profit margin reflects the previously mentioned improvement in gross profit margin as well as lower SG&A costs.\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $145.6 million and $59.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional information regarding restructuring actions and asset impairments is provided in Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding the loss on the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business is provided in Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-operating pension costs increased $5.4 million in 2020 to a total of $30.1 million, compared with $24.7 million in 2019. The higher year-over-year expense is primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets as a result of a full year's impact of the de-risking actions begun in 2019 on the U.S. pension plans which reallocated assets to a more conservative mix favoring fixed income investments. Service cost, a component of net periodic benefit plan expense, is reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income with approximately 75% in cost of sales and 25% in selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on employee benefit plans.\nNet interest expense totaled $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $61.6 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average borrowings as a result of the Company's efforts during 2020 to secure liquidity in light of volatility in the credit markets and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and was partially offset by lower interest rates.\nReportable segments\nThe Company reports its financial results in four reportable segments - Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nConsolidated operating profits, reported as Operating Profit\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income, are comprised of the following:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Packaging </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Display and Packaging </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paper and Industrial Converted Products </td> <td>154.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Protective Solutions </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Operating Profit </td> <td>527.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>525.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring/Asset impairment charges </td> <td>(145.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td>(4.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operational (charges)/income, net </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(289.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating profit* </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>467.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*Due to rounding, amounts above may not sum to the totals presented </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment results viewed by Company management to evaluate segment performance do not include restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related charges, gains or losses from the sale of businesses, pension settlement charges, specifically identified tax adjustments, and certain other items, if any, the exclusion of which the Company believes improves comparability and analysis.

General corporate expenses, with the exception of restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related charges, net interest expense and income taxes, have been allocated as operating costs to each of the Company's reportable segments.\nSee Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on reportable segments.\n26 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nConsumer Packaging\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,402.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,333.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>290.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>122.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>67.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales increased year over year due to volume improvements most notably in Rigid Paper Containers as the COVID-19 global pandemic increased consumers' preference for at-home meals. These volume increases were somewhat offset by declining sales prices driven mostly by lower resin costs. The year-over-year impact of acquisitions on sales totaled $85.6 million and included a full year of sales from TEQ, acquired December 31, 2019, and approximately five months of sales from Can Packaging, acquired August 3, 2020. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately $15 million year over year due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Domestic sales were approximately $1,704 million, up 2.7%, or $44 million, from 2019, while international sales were approximately $699 million, up 3.7%, or $25 million, from 2019.\nSegment operating profits increased by $62.1 million year over year and operating profit margins of 12.1% were up 230 basis points from 2019. The increases in segment operating profits and operating profit margins were largely driven by volume/mix and total productivity. Year-over-year operating profits were also higher as a result of 2020 acquisitions and the full-year impact in 2020 of acquisitions completed in 2019. These positive factors were partially offset by a negative price/cost impact.\nCapital spending in the segment included numerous productivity projects and expansion of manufacturing capabilities in North America (primarily rigid paper containers and plastics) and in Europe (primarily rigid paper containers).\nDisplay and Packaging\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic trade sales in the segment decreased $32 million, or 13.0%, to $215 million, while international trade sales decreased $46 million, or 15.1%, to $261 million. The decrease in both domestic and international trade sales resulted from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand for promotional displays and paper amenities. Additionally, the decrease in international sales reflects the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business in the fourth quarter and the negative impact of approximately $4 million from foreign currency translation as a result of a weaker Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar year over year. The increase in segment operating profit was largely due to total productivity gains in 2020.\nCapital spending in the segment was mostly related to customer development and productivity related projects in North America.\nPaper and Industrial Converted Products\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,877.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,974.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>154.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>93.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>85.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe main drivers of the year-over-year decrease in sales were pandemic-driven volume declines, lower selling prices, and a $27 million negative impact of foreign currency translation. The year-over-year impact of sales from acquisitions was approximately $44 million as 2020 included a full year of sales from Corenso, acquired August 2019, while 2019 included approximately five months. Total domestic sales in the segment increased $4 million, or 0.4%, to $1,100 million while international sales decreased $101 million, or 11.5%, to $778 million.\nSegment operating profit decreased year over year, driven by volume declines and a negative price/cost relationship, which were partially offset by productivity gains and the year-over-year impact of acquisitions.\nConditions continued to deteriorate for the corrugating medium operation in 2020 as a negative price/cost relationship and volume declines eroded the prior year's profitability. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company announced Project Horizon, a project to convert the Company's Hartsville corrugated medium machine to produce uncoated recycled paperboard. The scope of this $114 million project was expanded to include a finished goods warehouse and other infrastructure improvements to the Hartsville paper manufacturing complex. Project Horizon began in the last half of 2020 and is expected to be completed in mid 2022.\nSignificant capital spending in the segment included the modification of several paper machines in North America, numerous productivity projects, and IT investments.\nProtective Solutions\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>481.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>512.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales declined year over year, impacted mostly by volume declines in molded foam and consumer fiber packaging due to automotive plant shutdowns and lower consumer demand for durable goods such as appliances. In addition, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $4.3 million on year-over-year sales.Temperature-assured packaging sales were relatively flat during the year.\n27 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nSegment operating profit increased year over year due to total productivity mostly offset by volume declines and a negative price/cost relationship.\nDomestic sales were $393 million in 2020 down $14 million, or 3.5%, from 2019, while international sales were approximately $88 million, down $17 million, or 16.1% from 2019.\nCapital spending in the segment included numerous productivity initiatives as well as customer-related projects in our expanded foam protective packaging and temperature-assured packaging businesses.\nFinancial position, liquidity and capital resources\nCash flow\nOperating activities\nCash flows from operations totaled $705.6 million in 2020 and $425.9 million in 2019. This $279.8 million year-over-year increase was largely driven by the $200 million voluntary contribution made to the U.S. pension plans in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. The net cash impact of these voluntary contributions, after tax, totaled approximately $165 million. Cash flow from operations in 2020 includes a cash tax benefit of approximately $38 million related to anticipated 2021 contributions to one of the Company's defined benefit plans that will be deductible in its 2020 income tax filings. The cash flow impact of lower GAAP net income was essentially offset by higher non-cash asset impairment charges and improved working capital management.\nWorking capital provided $51.5 million of cash in 2020 compared to $36.9 million in 2019. The additional cash provision of $14.6 million was driven primarily by accounts payable and was the result of both active supplier contract management and higher raw material prices at the end of 2020 which muted the decline in the balance of accounts payable outstanding at December 31, 2020 versus the decline in 2019. In the prior year, accounts payable consumed cash as balances at December 31, 2019 were lower than at the beginning of the year due partially to lower raw material prices. Accounts receivable declined in 2020 due to a concerted effort by management regarding collections and other process improvements. While both accounts receivable and inventory provided cash during 2020, the provisions were lower than in 2019 when the related cash flows benefited from a more significant year-end slow down than in 2020.\nNon-cash asset impairment charges were $75.2 million higher year over year, due largely to the impairment of certain long-lived assets recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020 in the Company's perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations on the west coast of the United States and Mexico. In addition, the Company incurred a non-cash pre-tax loss of $14.5 million in 2020 on the sale of its European contract packaging business. Deferred income taxes and income taxes payable used $11.9 million of cash in 2020 compared with a provision of $10.8 million in 2019, a year-over-year change of $22.7 million. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided was largely attributable to a decrease in the amount of deferred tax expense in 2020, primarily from the write down of goodwill in conjunction with the disposition of the Company's European contract packaging business. Changes in accrued expenses reflect a $22.3 million provision of cash in 2020 compared with a $7.5 million provision of cash in 2019. The increase was largely the result of deferral of payments of the Company's portion of social security taxes, pursuant to the CARES Act. One half of the approximately $32 million deferral is due in 2021, and reflected in \"Accrued expenses and other\" and the remaining half is due in 2022 and reflected in \"Other Liabilities.\" Changes in other assets and liabilities provided $51.7 million more cash in 2020 compared to 2019 due in part to the CARES Act deferrals. Cash paid for income taxes was $17.5 million lower year over year, due primarily to lower net income.\nInvesting activities\nCash used by investing activities was $126.3 million in 2020, compared with $479.1 million in 2019. The lower use of cash in 2020 is due mostly to a decline in year-over-year acquisition spending. The Company's acquisitions consumed $49.3 million of cash in 2020 compared with $298.4 million in 2019. In addition, investing cash flows in 2020 included $103.4 million of proceeds from the sale of the Company's European contract packaging operations, net of certain transactional costs associated with the sale. The Company received proceeds from the sale of assets totaling $13.0 million in 2020 compared with $14.6 million in the prior year. Capital spending was slightly lower year over year, totaling $194.1 million in 2020, compared with $195.9 million in 2019, a decrease of $1.8 million.\nCapital spending is expected to total approximately $300 million in 2021, significantly higher than 2020, due to the resumption of projects that were placed on hold in 2020 and spending on \"Project Horizon\", a $114 million project to transform the corrugated medium paper machine in Hartsville, South Carolina, into a low-cost, state-of-the-art uncoated recycled paperboard machine and to optimize materials handling systems and storage facilities. Spending on Project Horizon is expected to be approximately $85 million in 2021.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities increased $240.1 million year over year as financing activities used $162.9 million of cash in 2020, compared with a net provision of cash totaling $77.2 million in 2019. The year-over-year change reflects net debt repayments of $14.2 million in 2020 compared with net borrowings of $267.3 million in 2019. The higher borrowing activity in 2019 stemmed from actions taken to provide cash for voluntary contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $200 million and to fund acquisitions. Outstanding debt was $1,700.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $1,681.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nCash dividends increased 1.4% to $172.6 million in 2020 compared to $170.3 million in 2019, reflecting a full year of the $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly dividend payment approved by the Board of Directors in April 2019.\nThe change in outstanding checks provided cash of $21.0 million in 2020 while using $4.5 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change is the result of the timing of the last accounts payable check runs in December 2020 and December 2019 relative to the Company's December 31 year end. Other financing cash flows in 2020 also included $14.5 million of proceeds realized from a net investment hedge.\n28 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due In </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024-2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Uncertain </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Obligations1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,700.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,226.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments2\n</td> <td>923.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>646.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>401.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition tax under Tax Act3\n</td> <td>41.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax contingencies4\n</td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations5\n</td> <td>88.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations6\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,166.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>602.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>262.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,075.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Includes obligations related to the Company's finance leases. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>Includes interest payments on outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations, as well as financing fees on the backstop line of credit. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>The Company's transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings under the Tax Act of 2017 was $80.6 million.

Current assets were higher due to an increase in cash mostly stemming from strong operating cash flows during the year, partly offset by the impact on the balance sheet of the sale of the Company's European contract packaging operations. Current liabilities were higher primarily due to the unfunded obligation of the Company's Inactive pension plan changing from long-term to current during 2020 in anticipation of settlement of the obligations in mid-2021.\nThe Company's cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $170.8 million and $115.0 million, respectively, of the Company's reported cash and cash equivalents balances of $564.8 million and $145.3 million, respectively, were held outside of the United States by its foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside of the United States is available to meet local liquidity needs, or for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other offshore growth opportunities. As the Company enjoys ample domestic liquidity through a combination of operating cash flow generation and access to bank and capital markets borrowings, we have generally considered our foreign unremitted earnings to be indefinitely invested outside the United States and currently have no plans to repatriate such earnings, other than excess cash balances that can be repatriated at minimal tax cost. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, the Company is not providing for taxes on these amounts for financial reporting purposes. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested is not practicable.\nThe Company operates a $500 million commercial paper program, supported by a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility. In July 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of eight banks for that revolving facility, together with a $250 million five-year term loan. The revolving bank credit facility is committed through July 2022. The Company has the contractual right to draw funds directly on the underlying revolving bank credit facility, which could possibly occur if there were a disruption in the commercial paper market.\nThe Company's total debt at December 31, 2020, was $1,700 million, a year-over-year increase of $19 million. The year-over-year change reflects the following actions taken by the Company in 2020 many of which were to secure liquidity early in the year in response to volatility in the credit markets and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u2022On March 18, 2020, the Company borrowed $150 million, pursuant to a new 364-day term loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, using the proceeds to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper. The Company repaid this loan on July 20, 2020.\n\u2022On April 1, 2020, the Company accessed $250 million from its revolving credit facility, using $85 million of the proceeds to fully repay its then outstanding commercial paper balance and investing the remaining proceeds in short-term cash equivalents. The Company repaid the remaining outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility on May 5, 2020.\n\u2022On April 6, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million, pursuant to a new 364-day term loan with U.S. Bank, National Association. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n\u2022On April 22, 2020, the Company sold through a public offering $600 million of 3.125% notes due May 1, 2030. The offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $594.2 million for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt.\n\u2022In May 2020, the Company exercised its one-time option to extend the term of its 364-day, $200 million term loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to May 2021. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n\u2022On November 30, 2020, the Company repaid the $137.1 million outstanding balance of its five-year term loan using proceeds from the sale of its European contract packaging business and available cash on hand.\nThe Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020 and $250 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt totaled $456 million, consisting primarily of $250 million of debentures due November 2021 and a $184 million Euro-denominated loan due May 2021. The Company expects to be able to fund these debt maturities through a combination of cash on hand and additional borrowings.\n29 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe Company uses a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity requirements. Under this pooling arrangement, the Company and its participating subsidiaries may maintain either a cash deposit or borrowing position through local currency accounts with the bank, so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit. Because it maintains a security interest in the cash deposits, and has the right to offset the cash deposits against the borrowings, the bank provides the Company and its participating subsidiaries favorable interest terms on both.\nThe Company, as part of its ongoing efforts to improve cash flow and related liquidity, works with suppliers to optimize its terms and conditions, including extending payment terms. Beginning in 2020, the Company started facilitating a voluntary supply chain financing program (the \"program\") to provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the program's participating financial institution. Such sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages the credit rating of the Company and thus might be more beneficial to the supplier. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under the program. Responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether those suppliers sell the receivables to the financial institution. The Company does not enter into any agreements with suppliers regarding their participation in the program.\nAll outstanding amounts owed under the program are recorded within trade accounts payable. The amount owed to the participating financial institution under the program and included in accounts payable for continuing operations was $38.9 million at December 31, 2020. The Company accounts for all payments made under the program as a reduction to cash flows from operations and reports them within \"changes in payable to suppliers\" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total amount settled through the program and paid by the Company to the participating financial institution was $50.3 million during 2020, the first year of the program. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million to $170 million will be settled through the program in 2021. A downgrade in the Company's credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions' willingness to commit funds to, and participate in, the program. However, the Company does not believe a reduction in, or the elimination of, the program would have a material impact on its working capital or cash flows.\nAcquisitions and internal investments are key elements of the Company's growth strategy. The Company believes that its cash on hand, coupled with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable it to support this strategy. Although the Company believes that it has excess borrowing capacity beyond its current lines, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or available on terms that are acceptable to the Company. The Company continually assesses its operational footprint as well as its overall portfolio of businesses and may consider the disposition of plants and/or business units it considers to be suboptimal or nonstrategic. Should these efforts result in the future sale of any plants or business units, management expects to first seek to utilize the proceeds to invest in growth projects or strategic acquisitions.\nThe net underfunded position of the Company's various U.S and international defined benefit pension and postretirement plans was $294 million at the end of 2020. The Company contributed approximately $40 million to its benefit plans in 2020. On July 17, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\"), a tax-qualified defined benefit plan, effective September 30, 2019. Upon completion of a limited lump-sum offering during the second quarter of 2021, the Company expects to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan through the purchase of annuities in mid-2021 and anticipates making additional contributions to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time of the annuity purchase. The Company realized a cash tax benefit of approximately $38 million in 2020 on these anticipated contributions that will be deductible in its 2020 income tax filings. Contributions to all other benefit plans in 2021, including the Sonoco Retirement Contribution, are expected to total approximately $36 million. Future funding requirements will depend largely on the nature and timing of participant settlements, actual investment returns, future actuarial assumptions, and legislative actions.\nTotal equity increased $95 million during 2020 as net income of $207 million, other comprehensive income of $58 million and stock-based compensation of $11 million were partially offset by dividends of $174 million and share repurchases of $8 million. The primary components of other comprehensive income were a $46 million translation gain from the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the Company's foreign investments and a reduction in actuarial losses totaling $12 million, net of tax, in the Company's various defined benefit plans resulting primarily from ongoing amortization.\nOn February 10, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. No shares have been repurchased under this authorization since 2016 when a total of 2.03 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $100 million. Accordingly, a total of 2.97 million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization at December 31, 2020.\nAlthough the ultimate determination of whether to pay dividends is within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company plans to increase dividends as earnings grow. Dividends per common share were $1.72 in 2020, $1.70 in 2019 and $1.62 in 2018. On February 10, 2021, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.45 per common share payable on March 10, 2021, to shareholders of record on February 24, 2021. This dividend reflects an increase of $0.02 per common share for the quarter and is equivalent to an annualized dividend of $1.80 per common share.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020.\nRisk management\nAs a result of operating globally, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The exposure is well diversified, as the Company's facilities are located throughout the world, and the Company generally sells in the same countries where it produces with both revenue and costs transacted in the local currency. The Company monitors these exposures and may use traditional currency swaps and forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency assets and liabilities or net investment in foreign subsidiaries. The Company's foreign operations are exposed to political, geopolitical and cultural risks, but the risks are mitigated by diversification and the relative stability of the countries in which the Company has significant operations.\nDue to the highly inflationary economy in Venezuela, the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be the functional currency of its Venezuelan operations and uses the official exchange rate when remeasuring the financial results of those operations. Economic conditions in Venezuela have worsened considerably over the past several years and there is no indication that conditions are due to improve in the foreseeable future. Further deterioration could result in the recognition of an impairment charge or a deconsolidation of the subsidiary. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company's net investment in its Venezuelan operations was approximately $2.0 million. In addition, at December 31, 2020, the Company's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss included a cumulative translation loss of $3.8 million related to its Venezuela operations which would need to be reclassified to net income in the event of a complete exit of the business or a deconsolidation of these operations.\nThe Company has operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe that could be impacted by the exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) at the end of January 2020 and the new E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement which went into effect December\n30 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n31, 2020. Our U.K. operations have been making contingency plans regarding potential customs clearance issues, tariffs and other uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the new agreement with the European Union. Although it is difficult to predict all of the possible impacts to our supply chain or in our customers' downstream markets, the Company has evaluated the potential operational impacts and uncertainties of Brexit and at this time believes that the likelihood of a material impact on our future results of operations is low. Although there are some cross-border sales made out of and into the U.K., most of what we produce in the U.K. is also sold in the U.K. and the same is true for continental Europe. In some cases, companies that have been importing from Europe into the U.K. are now seeking local sources, which has actually been positive for our U.K. operations. Annual sales of the Company's U.K. operations totaled approximately $127 million in 2020.\nThe Company is a purchaser of various raw material inputs such as recovered paper, energy, steel, aluminum and plastic resin. The Company generally does not engage in significant hedging activities for these purchases, other than for energy and, from time to time, aluminum, because there is usually a high correlation between the primary input costs and the ultimate selling price of its products. Inputs are generally purchased at market or at fixed prices that are established with individual suppliers as part of the purchase process for quantities expected to be consumed in the ordinary course of business. On occasion, where the correlation between selling price and input price is less direct, the Company may enter into derivative contracts such as futures or swaps to manage the effect of price fluctuations. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, use traditional, unleveraged interest-rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and variable rate debt and to control its exposure to interest rate movements within select ranges.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had derivative contracts outstanding to hedge the price on a portion of anticipated raw materials and natural gas purchases. These contracts included swaps to hedge the purchase price of approximately 7.1 million MMBTUs of natural gas in the U.S., Canada and Mexico representing approximately 67% of anticipated natural gas usage for 2021. Additionally, the Company had swap contracts covering 3,860 metric tons of aluminum representing approximately 57% of anticipated usage for 2021. The aluminum hedges relate to fixed-price customer contracts. Beginning in 2020, the Company entered into commodity contracts to fix the cost of a portion of anticipated diesel purchases. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts, the fair value of which was not material at December 31, 2020.\nThe Company routinely enters into forward contracts or swaps to economically hedge the currency exposure of intercompany debt and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. The Company does not apply hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815 for these instruments. As such, changes in fair value are recorded directly to income and expense in the periods that they occur. At December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of these contracts, in U.S. dollar terms, was $90 million, of which $16 million related to the Canadian dollar, $37 million to the Mexican peso, $19 million to the Polish Zloty, $10 million to the Colombian Peso and $8 million to all other currencies.\nThe total fair market value of the Company's derivatives was a net favorable position of $0.6 million at December 31, 2020, and a net unfavorable position of $0.5 million at December 31, 2019. Derivatives are marked to fair value using published market prices, if available, or using estimated values based on current price quotes and a discounted cash flow model. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on financial instruments.\nBeginning in January 2020, the Company was party to a cross-currency swap agreement with a notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert a portion of the Company's fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, including the semi-annual interest payments, to fixed-rate euro-denominated debt. The swap agreement, which had a maturity of November 1, 2024, provided the Company to receive semi-annual interest payments in U.S. dollars at a rate of 5.75% and pay interest in euros at a rate of 3.856%. The risk management objective was to manage foreign currency risk relating to net investments in certain European subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. As a result of significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of 2020, as well as a reduction in the differential between U.S. and European interest rates, the fair market value of the swap position appreciated significantly. In March 2020, the Company terminated the swap agreement and received a cash settlement of $14.5 million. The Company recorded this foreign currency translation gain in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss,\" net of a tax provision of $7.6 million.\nAs a result of the weakening global economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company increased its allowance for cumulative expected credit losses by $0.3 million during 2020. Continued weakness in the economy may require additional charges to be recognized in future periods.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business, concerning, among other matters, solid waste disposal, wastewater effluent and air emissions. Although the costs of compliance have not been significant due to the nature of the materials and processes used in manufacturing operations, such laws also make generators of hazardous wastes and their legal successors financially responsible for the cleanup of sites contaminated by those wastes. The Company has been named a potentially responsible party at several environmentally contaminated sites. These regulatory actions and a small number of private party lawsuits are believed to represent the Company's largest potential environmental liabilities. The Company has accrued $8.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $8.7 million at December 31, 2019, with respect to these sites. See Environmental Charges,\u201d Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on environmental matters.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to inventories, bad debts, derivatives, income taxes, share-based compensation, goodwill, intangible assets, restructuring, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, and contingencies and litigation. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The impact of and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions and accounting policies are discussed in Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions and accounting policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial results.\nThe Company believes the accounting policies discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are critical to understanding the results of its operations. The following discussion represents those policies that involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n31 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company's acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, \"Business Combinations.\" The Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities including those related to debt, pensions and other postretirement plans, uncertain tax positions, contingent consideration and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired customer relationships, technology, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.\nImpairment of long-lived, intangible and other assets\nAssumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of potential impairment can result in adjustments affecting the carrying values of long-lived, intangible and other assets and the recognition of impairment expense in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment), definite-lived intangible assets and other assets (including right of use lease assets, notes receivable and equity investments) for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist, or when it commits to sell the asset. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible asset group is less than the carrying value of that asset group, an asset impairment charge is recognized. Key assumptions and estimates used in the projection of expected future cash flows generally include price levels, sales growth, profit margins and asset life. The amount of an impairment charge, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, generally represented by the discounted future cash flows from that asset or, in the case of assets the Company evaluates for sale, estimated sale proceeds less costs to sell. The Company takes into consideration historical data and experience together with all other relevant information available when estimating the fair values of its assets. However, fair values that could be realized in actual transactions may differ from the estimates used to evaluate impairment. In addition, changes in the assumptions and estimates may result in a different conclusion regarding impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling $77.9 million on certain long-lived, intangible, and right of use assets. Management concluded that these assets, primarily in the Company's perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations, were impaired as their projected undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover their carrying values.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Company assesses its goodwill for impairment annually and from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units or the Company as a whole. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's assets, including goodwill, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment charge to goodwill is recognized for the excess. The Company's reporting units are the same as, or one level below, its operating segments, as determined in accordance with ASC 350.\nThe Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2020. For testing purposes, the Company performed an assessment of each reporting unit using either a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluations considered factors such as the macroeconomic environment, Company stock price and market capitalization movement, current year operating performance as compared to prior projections, business strategy changes, and significant customer wins and losses. The quantitative tests, described further below, relied on the current outlook of reporting unit management for future operating results and took into consideration, among other things, the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operations, specific business unit risk, the countries in which the reporting units operate, and implied fair values based on comparable trading and transaction multiples.\nWhen performing a quantitative analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on projections of future years' operating results and associated cash flows. The Company's assessments reflected a number of significant management assumptions and estimates including the Company's forecast of sales growth, contribution margins, selling, general and administrative expenses, and discount rates, which are validated by observed comparable trading and transaction multiples. The Company's model discounts projected future cash flows, forecasted over a ten-year period, with an estimated residual growth rate. The Company's projections incorporate management's estimates of the most-likely expected future results. Projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate that management believes is appropriate for the reporting unit.\nThe Company's assessments, whether qualitative or quantitative, incorporate management's expectations for the future, including forecasted growth rates and/or margin improvements. Therefore, should there be changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and/or expectations, management's conclusions regarding goodwill impairment may change as well. Management's projections related to revenue growth and/or margin improvements are based on a combination of factors, including expectations for volume growth with existing customers and customer retention, product expansion, changes in price/cost relationships, productivity gains, fixed cost leverage, and stability or improvement in general economic conditions.\nIn considering the level of uncertainty regarding the potential for goodwill impairment, management has concluded that any such impairment would, in most cases, likely be the result of adverse changes in more than one assumption. Management considers the assumptions used to be its best estimates across a range of possible outcomes based on available evidence at the time of the assessment. Other than in Display and Packaging and Conitex, which are discussed below, there is no specific singular event or single change in circumstances management has identified that it believes could reasonably result in a change to expected future results in any of its reporting units sufficient to result in goodwill impairment. In management's opinion, a change of such magnitude would more likely be the result of changes to some combination of the factors identified above, a general deterioration in competitive position, introduction of a superior technology, significant unexpected changes in customer preferences, an inability to pass through significant raw material cost increases, and other such items as identified in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough no reporting units failed the annual impairment test noted above, in management's opinion, the goodwill of the Display and Packaging and Conitex reporting units are at risk of impairment in the near term if these reporting units' operations do not perform in line with\n32 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nmanagement's expectations, or if there is a negative change in the long-term outlook for these businesses or in other factors such as the discount rate.\nThe Company's Display and Packaging operations were tested for impairment twice during the quarter, once on a combined basis as of June 28, 2020 and once on a bifurcated basis as of September 27, 2020. The combined reporting unit designs, manufactures, assembles, packs and distributes temporary, semi-permanent and permanent point-of-purchase displays; provides supply chain management services, including contract packing, fulfillment and scalable service centers; and manufactures retail packaging, including printed backer cards, thermoformed blisters and heat sealing equipment. The goodwill impairment analyses as of both June 28, 2020 and September 27, 2020, incorporate management's expectations for conservative sales growth and mild improvements to profit margin percentages which reflect the estimated benefits of future productivity initiatives. A large portion of projected sales on both a combined and separate basis is concentrated in several major customers, the loss of any of which could impact the Company's conclusion regarding the likelihood of goodwill impairment. The Company concluded that as of June 28, 2020, the goodwill of the reporting unit, prior to it being bifurcated, was not impaired. In September 2020, subsequent to the date of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company's Board of Directors approved the sale of the European portion of this reporting unit, which the Company concluded met the held-for-sale reporting criteria. Accordingly, the Display and Packaging reporting unit was subsequently evaluated as two separate reporting units, Display and Packaging Europe and the retained Display and Packaging operations. Goodwill of approximately $77 million was allocated to the European business on a proportional fair value basis and disposed of in conjunction with the sale of the business on November 30, 2020. After this allocation, the remaining goodwill associated with the retained operations was approximately $127 million and was tested for impairment at September 27, 2020. Based on this test, the estimated fair value of the retained Display and Packaging reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.2%.\nIn addition, the 2020 results of the Conitex reporting unit have been negatively impacted by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to end-market weakness, particularly in textiles, as well as certain customers' plants having been temporarily shut down to contain the spread of the virus. Management currently expects customer demand to increase over the next few quarters and approach pre-pandemic levels late in 2021 or early in 2022. However, should it become apparent that the recovery in demand is likely to be weaker, or significantly delayed, compared to management's current expectations, a goodwill impairment charge may be possible in the future. Total goodwill associated with this reporting unit was approximately $34 million at December 31, 2020. Based on the current annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of the Conitex reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6.9%.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn its goodwill impairment analysis as of September 27, 2020, projected future cash flows for the retained Display and Packaging operations were discounted at 9.1%. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the projected operating profits of the retained Display and Packaging operations would have to be reduced across all future periods approximately 2.1%, or the discount rate increased to 10.6%, in order for the estimated fair value to fall below the reporting unit's carrying value.\nIn its 2020 annual goodwill impairment analysis, projected future cash flows for Conitex were discounted at 10.8%. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, Conitex's projected operating profits across all future periods would have to be reduced approximately 6.2%, or the discount rate increased to 12.2%, in order for the estimated fair value to fall below the reporting unit's carrying value.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets generally represent expenses that have been recognized for financial reporting purposes, but for which the corresponding tax deductions will occur in future periods. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not standard, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Associated interest has also been recognized, where applicable.\nAs previously disclosed, in February 2017 the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ( NOPA\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) proposing adjustments to the 2012 and 2013 tax years. In 2018, the Company filed a protest to the proposed deficiency and the matter was referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company agreed to pay approximately $6 million in taxes and interest to settle the dispute and recorded the impact of this settlement in its provision for income taxes. The Company anticipates finalizing the audit and paying the assessment in 2021.\nThe estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. As a result, the eventual resolution of these matters could have a different impact on the effective rate than currently reflected or expected.\nStock-based compensation plans\nThe Company utilizes share-based compensation in the form of restricted stock units, performance contingent restricted stock units, and other share-based awards. The amount of share-based compensation expense associated with the performance contingent restricted stock unit is based on estimates of future performance using measures defined in the plans. For the 2020 grant, the performance measures consist of Base Earnings per Share and Return on Invested Capital while the performance measures for prior unvested grants consist of Base Earnings per Share and Return on Net Assets Employed. Changes in estimates regarding the future achievement of these performance measures may result in significant fluctuations from period to period in the amount of share-based compensation expense reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThrough 2019, the Company granted stock appreciation rights (SARs) annually on a discretionary basis to key employees. The Company uses an option-pricing model to determine the grant date fair value for this type of award. Inputs to the model include a number of subjective assumptions. Management routinely assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of share-based compensation per share. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time that results in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, which could materially impact fair value per share determinations.\n33 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nPension and postretirement benefit plans\nThe Company has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The largest of the Company's pension plans are the U.S.-based Sonoco Pension Plan (the \"Active Plan\") and the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\"). Benefits under the Active Plan were frozen for all active, non-union participants, effective December 31, 2018, and these participants became eligible for annual contributions under a noncontributory defined contribution plan. Participants with frozen benefits under the Active Plan were transferred to the Inactive Plan effective July 1, 2019. On July 17, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Inactive Plan effective September 30, 2019. Following completion of a limited lump-sum offering in the second quarter of 2021, the Company is expected to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan in mid 2021 through the purchase of annuities.\nThe actuarial valuations used to evaluate the plans employ key assumptions that can have a significant effect on the calculated amounts. The key assumptions used at December 31, 2020 in determining the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation for U.S. retirement and retiree health and life insurance plans include: discount rates of 2.75% and 2.31% for the Active Plan and Inactive Plan, respectively, 2.28% for the non-qualified retirement plans, and 2.04% for the retiree health and life insurance plan. The discount rate for the Inactive Plan was determined on a plan termination basis. The rate of compensation increase for the retiree health and life insurance plan was 3.03%. The key assumptions used to determine the 2020 net periodic benefit cost for U.S. retirement and retiree health and life insurance plans include: discount rates of 3.37% and 2.84% for the Active Plan and Inactive Plan, respectively, 3.05% for the non-qualified retirement plans, and 2.89% for the retiree health and life insurance plan; an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 2.93% for both the Active and Inactive Plans; and a rate of compensation increase for the retiree health and life insurance plan of 3.04%.\nDuring 2020, the Company recorded total pension and postretirement benefit expenses of approximately $58.0 million, compared with $52.7 million during 2019. The 2020 amount reflects $51.1 million of expected returns on plan assets at an average assumed rate of 3.18% and interest cost of $51.6 million at a weighted-average discount rate of 2.76%. The 2019 amount reflects $65.9 million of expected returns on plan assets at an average assumed rate of 6.13% and interest cost of $57.8 million at a weighted-average discount rate of 3.96%. During 2020, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of $40.4 million. In the prior year, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement plans totaling $231.2 million, including voluntary contributions to the Active and Inactive Plans totaling $200 million. Contributions vary from year to year depending on various factors, the most significant being the market value of assets and interest rates. Cumulative net actuarial losses were approximately $736 million at December 31, 2020, and are primarily the result of low discount rates. Actuarial losses/gains outside of the 10% corridor defined by U.S. GAAP are amortized over the average remaining service life of the plan's active participants or the average remaining life expectancy of the plan's inactive participants if all, or almost all, of the plan's participants are inactive. The majority of these actuarial losses are related to the Inactive Plan and will result in non-cash settlement charges of approximately $560 million in mid 2021 as the obligations of the plan are settled through lump-sum payouts and annuity purchases pursuant to the termination of the plan. The Company anticipates making additional contributions to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in mid 2021 in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time annuity purchases are made.\nExcluding the expected settlement charges related to the Inactive Plan, the Company projects total benefit plan expense to be approximately $13 million lower in 2021 than in 2020. This decrease is due primarily to recognition of only a partial year of expenses related to the Inactive Plan in 2021 which is expected to be nearly fully settled by the end of the second quarter 2021.\nThe Company adjusts its discount rates at the end of each fiscal year based on yield curves of high-quality debt instruments over durations that match the expected benefit payouts of each plan. The expected rate of return assumption is derived by taking into consideration the targeted plan asset allocation, projected future returns by asset class and active investment management. A third-party asset return model was used to develop an expected range of returns on plan investments over a 12- to 15-year period, with the expected rate of return selected from a best estimate range within the total range of projected results. The Company periodically re-balances its plan asset portfolio in order to maintain the targeted allocation levels. The rate of compensation increase assumption is generally based on salary and incentive compensation increases. A key assumption for the U.S. retiree health and life insurance plan is a medical cost trend rate beginning at 6.0% for post-age 65 participants and trending down to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2026. The ultimate trend rate of 4.5% represents the Company's best estimate of the long-term average annual medical cost increase over the duration of the plan's liabilities. It provides for real growth in medical costs in excess of the overall inflation level.\nThe sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for the Company's U.S. plans as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Percentage\nPoint\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Projected Benefit\nObligation\nHigher/(Lower)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Annual\nExpense\nHigher/\n(Lower)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>-.25 pts </td> <td> </td> <td>$44.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets </td> <td>-.25 pts </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.2 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther assumptions and estimates impacting the projected liabilities of these plans include inflation, participant withdrawal and mortality rates and retirement ages. The Company evaluates the assumptions used in projecting the pension and postretirement liabilities and associated expense annually. These judgments, assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of pension and postretirement plan net assets and liabilities and pension and postretirement plan expenses in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses Sonoco's operations, financial performance, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to the Company's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with approximately 320 locations in 34 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, in 2020 approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 6% in Asia, 4% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in uncoated recycled paperboard, tubes, cores, cones and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nCOVID-19\nImpact on Operating Results\nAround the world, Sonoco is an essential provider of consumer, industrial and medical packaging. Sonoco associates are deemed Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\u201d under the guidance of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and have received similar designations by the vast majority of other governmental agencies in the 34 countries where the Company operates. As a result, nearly all of the Company's global operations were able to continue to operate despite locally-mandated temporary shutdown orders that were issued in many of our geographic locations. Certain customers whose products were not deemed critically essential\u201d had to temporarily suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while some others had time periods when they were unable to fully staff their operations. As areas around the world have largely reopened their economies, the Company has seen improved demand for many of its products and services. However, recent indications of a resurgence of the virus in certain regions and the emergence of variants of the virus for which existing vaccines could be less effective have raised concerns about the re-imposition of local restrictions on business activity and a negative effect on consumer behavior that alone, or together, could impede the economic recovery. Sonoco is following these developments closely and will respond with appropriate changes to active production capacity and cost-management initiatives. An extended period of disruption to our served markets or global supply chains could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition. In addition, an extended global recession caused by the pandemic would have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial condition.\nWhile the social distancing response to COVID-19 has resulted in increased consumer demand for certain food and household products, the pandemic's recessionary impact on the worldwide economy has significantly decreased demand in our more economically sensitive industrial related businesses and exacerbated their negative price/cost relationships. As a result, the overall impact of the pandemic on 2020 consolidated results was negative. While we expect the pandemic to continue having a mixed impact on demand for our products in 2021, we expect that demand and mix across our businesses will largely revert to pre-pandemic levels over the course of the year. However, although we expect that, relative to 2020, consolidated results will benefit from this reversion, we still expect a net negative impact to 2021 consolidated earnings relative to pre-pandemic levels and that many of our businesses will continue to experience negative price/cost pressure.\nWe expect our Consumer Packaging segment to experience normal seasonal volume trends in 2021 and to perform well relative to pre-pandemic levels. However, as the pandemic wanes, total volume is expected to be flat year over year as sales of at-home food packaging decline and demand in other consumer market segments picks up. We expect our industrial-related markets to continue experiencing weak but improving demand into the summer or fall, with our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment continuing to face a negative price/cost relationship due to higher year-over-year recycled fiber costs; however, we expect industrial demand will improve more substantially over the back-half of the year if the pandemic continues to subside. Our Protective Solutions and Display and Packaging businesses are expected to benefit from the continued economic recovery.\nFinancial Flexibility and Liquidity\nSonoco has a strong, investment-grade balance sheet and substantial liquidity available in the form of cash, cash equivalents and revolving credit facilities, as well as the ability to issue commercial paper and to access liquidity in the banking and debt capital markets. The following actions taken in 2020 largely related to the Company's efforts to either improve near-term liquidity or secure additional liquidity in light of volatility in the credit markets and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u2022On March 18, 2020, the Company closed and funded a new $150 million, 364-day term loan, the proceeds from which were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper. The Company repaid this loan on July 20, 2020.\n\u2022On April 1, 2020, the Company accessed $250 million from its revolving credit facility, using $85 million of the proceeds to fully repay its then outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company repaid this loan on May 5, 2020.\n\u2022On April 6, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million pursuant to a new 364-day term loan. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n\u2022On April 22, 2020, the Company sold $600 million of 3.125% notes due May 1, 2030, using a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of existing debt.\n\u2022In May 2020, the Company exercised its one-time option to extend the term of its 364-day, $200 million term loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to May 2021. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n20 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n\u2022On November 30, 2020, the Company repaid the remaining balance of its five-year term loan using proceeds from the sale of its European contract packaging business.\nFollowing the actions above, at December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $565 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, $500 million in committed availability under its revolving credit facility, and scheduled debt maturities in 2021 of approximately $456 million.\nHealth, Safety and Business Continuity\nThe health and safety of Sonoco's associates, contractors, suppliers and the general public are a top priority. Included among the safety measures we have recently implemented are: conducting health screenings for personnel entering our operations, routinely cleaning high-touch surfaces, following social distancing protocols, prohibiting all non-critical business travel, and encouraging all associates who can to work from home when possible. Additionally, Sonoco has launched a dedicated COVID-19 internal microsite to keep its associates up to date on Company and health authority information, guidelines, protocols and policies, including those set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSonoco has also put in place a Global Task Force to develop and implement business continuity plans to ensure its operations are as prepared as possible to be able to continue producing and shipping product to its customers without disruption. Sonoco has a diverse global supply chain and to date has not experienced significant raw material or other supply disruptions.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, non-operating pension costs, certain income tax events and adjustments, and other items, if any, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company consistently applies its non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein and uses them for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 24 and 25 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2020 overview and 2021 outlook\nManagement's primary focus areas in 2020 were profitable growth, improving margins, improving cash flow, and sustainability. Overall, management was expecting a notable increase in net sales, largely driven by the full-year impact of 2019 acquisitions, and modest improvements in overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Management had targeted an overall 2020 organic volume increase of approximately 1.0% and was expecting a negative price/cost relationship. Manufacturing and other productivity gains were expected to offset a significant portion of projected increases in labor and other costs.\nHowever, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, management's focus quickly turned to addressing the many unprecedented issues and challenges the pandemic presented, including protecting workers' safety, simultaneously accelerating production of products that experienced a surge in demand and scaling down operations producing products that experienced sharp declines, and managing the ensuing volatility in material costs and financial markets.\nAs noted above, the pandemic had wide-ranging impacts on the operations and financial results of our various businesses, both positive and negative. Despite the full-year benefit of 2019 acquisitions, overall sales declined 2.5%, reflecting reduced demand in our more economically sensitive industrial-related businesses, partially offset by increased demand in our Consumer Packaging segment, particularly food packaging.\nGAAP operating profit declined $109.3 million from the prior year largely driven by higher restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as a loss on the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business. In 2020, the Company recorded after-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges of $112.7 million, which were largely attributable to its perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations on the west coast of\n21 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nthe United States and in Mexico. Despite the decline in GAAP operating profit, total segment operating profit (referred to as base operating profit) was essentially unchanged from the prior year. A recession-induced decline in the Paper and Industrial Related Products segment was almost fully offset by an increase in Consumer Packaging operating profit driven by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand for certain food and household products. Overall, net productivity gains were able to offset lower volume as well as a negative price cost relationship.\nCurrent year gross profit was $1,046.3 million, compared with $1,057.8 million in 2019. Despite the small decline, gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 20.0%, compared to 19.7% in 2019. GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were relatively flat as decreases due to a focus on managing costs, together with the impact of the pandemic on travel, employee medical and other expenses were partially offset by additional SG&A expenses from acquired businesses.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2020 decreased 28.9%, or $84.3 million, from 5.4% of sales to 4.0% of sales, reflecting the decline in operating profit as well as higher net interest expense. Although base operating profit was essentially unchanged, base earnings attributable to Sonoco declined 3.3%, or $11.7 million, year over year, reflecting the higher net interest expense and a somewhat higher effective base income tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 20.7%, compared with 24.5% in 2019, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 25.1%, compared with 23.9% in 2019. The year-over-year decrease in the GAAP tax rate was driven primarily by the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business and a related write down of the deferred tax liability on goodwill. The increase in the effective tax rate on base earnings in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nOn August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands the Company's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. This transaction, and the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in January 2020, are described in greater detail below. On November 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its European contract packaging business which was a component of the Display and Packaging segment.\nOn July 17, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\") effective September 30, 2019. Approval of the termination was received from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in 2020. Following completion of a limited lump-sum offering, the Company is expected to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan through the purchases of annuities in mid 2021. In anticipation of settling these liabilities, the Company took measures beginning in 2019 to derisk the Inactive Plan's assets by investing them in a conservative mix of primarily fixed income investments. During 2020, the Company recorded total pension and postretirement benefit expenses of approximately $58.0 million, compared with $52.7 million during 2019. The increased expense was primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets as a result of a full year's impact of the derisking of the Inactive Plan portfolio. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans remained at $294 million at the end of both 2020 and 2019 as increases in plan liabilities from interest and lower discount rates were offset by increases in plan assets from Company contributions and investment returns.\nThe Company generated $705.6 million in cash from operations during 2020, compared with $425.9 million in 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the approximately $165 million after-tax voluntary contribution to the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. Cash generated from operations also improved due to the deferral of payments of the Company's portion of social security taxes pursuant to the CARES Act and a cash tax benefit generated by the expected funding in mid-2021 of the Inactive Plan as the obligations of the plan are settled.\nOutlook\nManaging through the pandemic will continue to be a primary focus in 2021; however, the Company also expects to drive profitable growth, expand gross profit margin and enhance sustainability in our operations and our product lines. Key to achieving management's objectives for 2021 and beyond will be a strategy to invest in ourselves and product markets where we have competitive advantages and can be value adding. A prime example of this strategy is the Company's $114 million investment in Project Horizon announced earlier in 2020, which will convert the Hartsville corrugated medium machine to be able to produce uncoated recycled paperboard. The scope of the project was expanded to include a finished goods warehouse and other infrastructure improvements to the Hartsville paper manufacturing complex. When completed in 2022, Project Horizon is estimated to drive approximately $30 million in annualized cost savings. In addition, the Company will work to further develop its previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2021 of approximately 2.0% driven largely by a continuation of the economic recovery and a steady return to pre-pandemic demand levels across our businesses. In addition, the Company expects to benefit from growth in chilled and prepared food volume, improved perimeter of the store performance, new sustainable products, and growth in our medical and retail security businesses. The Company will also continue to look for strategic and opportunistic acquisition candidates as well as opportunities to optimize our overall business portfolio.\nThe Company has projected that company-wide price/cost will be negative in 2021 due to higher year-over-year prices in key raw materials, such as recycled fiber and plastic resins, and higher freight costs. Manufacturing and other productivity gains are expected to offset a significant portion of the negative price/cost impact and projected increases in labor and other costs; however, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2021 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from the August 2020 Can Packaging acquisition, but will not include the revenue and profit of the European contract packaging business sold November 30, 2020; together, these items are estimated to have a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $240 million on revenue and a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $0.14 on diluted earnings per share.\nThe Company projects the operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense will be approximately $1 million higher year over year, while the non-operating component, excluding settlement charges, is projected to be $13 million lower. The net anticipated decrease of $12 million is due primarily to recognition of only a partial year of expenses related to the Inactive Plan which is expected to be fully settled by the end of the second quarter 2021. Non-cash, non-base, pretax settlement charges totaling approximately $560 million are expected to be recognized in 2021 as the liabilities of the Inactive Plan, terminated in 2019, are settled through lump-sum payouts and annuity purchases. The Company anticipates making an additional contribution to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in mid-2021 in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time of the annuity purchase. Contributions to all other defined benefit plans in 2021 are expected to total approximately $15 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported 2021 net sales will stay relatively flat at approximately $5.2 billion and overall margins for gross profit will improve approximately 0.8% over 2020. Base operating profit as a percent of sales is expected to remain at approximately 10.1%.\nCash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $585 million in 2021. Absent additional borrowings for acquisitions or significant changes in interest rates, net interest expense is expected to be lower year over year by approximately $12 million primarily due to lower average borrowing levels. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be approximately 25.4% in 2021 compared with 25.1% in 2020.\n22 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nAs noted below, the Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results. However, due to the magnitude of the pension settlement charges expected to be recognized in 2021, as described above, the Company anticipates it will report a GAAP net loss for the year.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2020 at a cost of $49.4 million, net of cash acquired. On August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a privately owned designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France, for $45.5 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This settlement occurred in January 2021 and resulted in the Company making an additional cash payment of approximately $1.6 million. Can Packaging operates two paper can manufacturing facilities in France, along with a research and development center where it designs and builds patented packaging machines and sealing equipment. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands Sonoco's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. The operations of Can Packaging are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On January 10, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in Jacksonville, Florida, from Design Containers, Inc. (\"Jacksonville\"), for total cash consideration of $4.0 million. The operations of Jacksonville are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2019 at a cost of $297.9 million, net of cash acquired. On December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Thermoform Engineered Quality, LLC, and Plastique Holdings, LTD, (together \"TEQ\") for $187.3 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing and resulted in the receipt of cash from the sellers totaling $0.2 million in April 2020. The acquired operations consist of three thermoforming and extrusion facilities in the United States along with a thermoforming operation in the United Kingdom and a thermoforming and molded-fiber operation in Poland, which together employ approximately 500 associates. The acquisition of TEQ provides a strong platform to further expand Sonoco's growing healthcare packaging business. The operations of TEQ are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On August 9, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Corenso for $110.6 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing which was settled in November 2019 requiring an additional cash payment to the sellers of approximately $0.1 million. Corenso is a leading manufacturer of uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) and high-performance cores used in the paper, packaging films, tape, and specialty industries. Corenso operates a 108,000-ton per year URB mill and core converting facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as a core converting facility in Richmond, Virginia, expanding the Company's ability to produce a wide variety of sustainable coreboard grades. The operations of Corenso are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company made final contingent payments totaling $3.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for acquisitions completed in prior years. In 2020 the Company settled a $2.5 million contingent purchase obligation related to the 2018 acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\") based on certain sales metrics being met and a $0.5 million contingent purchase liability related to the 2016 acquisition of AAR Corporation (\"AAR\"). In 2019 the Company settled additional contingent purchase obligations related to Highland and AAR totaling $5.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The payment of these contingent obligations are reflected as financing activities on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company completed the divestiture of its European contract packaging business, Sonoco Poland Packaging Services Sp. z.o.o. to a subsidiary of Prairie Industries Holdings, a Wisconsin-based contract packaging and contract manufacturing firm backed by The Halifax Group. These operations provided full-service custom packaging and supply chain management solutions to global consumer product goods companies from three locations in Poland with approximately 2,600 employees. The selling price of $120 million was adjusted at closing for certain indebtedness assumed by the buyer and for anticipated differences between targeted levels of working capital and the projected levels at the time of closing. The Company received net cash proceeds at closing of $105.9 million, with the buyer funding an escrow account with an additional $4.6 million, of which $4.0 million is expected to be released to the Company upon final sales adjustments in the first quarter of 2021, and the remainder, pending any indemnity claims, in the second quarter of 2022. The Company also anticipates that final working capital settlements will result in additional cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Transaction fees totaling $2.5 million were paid out of the proceeds received. Cumulative currency translation adjustment losses of $12.4 million associated with this entity were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a part of the net loss on the sale of the business which totaled $14.5 million. The decision to sell the European contract packaging business was part of the Company's efforts to simplify its operating structure to focus on growing its core Consumer and Industrial packaging businesses. The disposition of these operations is expected to negatively impact the 2021 year-over-year sales comparison by approximately $260 million. This sale is not expected to notably affect operating margin percentages nor does it represent a strategic shift for the Company that will have a major effect on its operations and financial results.\nThe Company continually assesses its operational footprint as well as its overall portfolio of businesses and may consider the disposition of plants and/or business units it considers to be suboptimal or nonstrategic. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\n23 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (approximately 320 locations in 34 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges for", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to the Company's plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with approximately 320 locations in 34 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, in 2020 approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 6% in Asia, 4% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in uncoated recycled paperboard, tubes, cores, cones and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nCOVID-19\nImpact on Operating Results\nAround the world, Sonoco is an essential provider of consumer, industrial and medical packaging. Sonoco associates are deemed Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\u201d under the guidance of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and have received similar designations by the vast majority of other governmental agencies in the 34 countries where the Company operates. As a result, nearly all of the Company's global operations were able to continue to operate despite locally-mandated temporary shutdown orders that were issued in many of our geographic locations. Certain customers whose products were not deemed critically essential\u201d had to temporarily suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while some others had time periods when they were unable to fully staff their operations. As areas around the world have largely reopened their economies, the Company has seen improved demand for many of its products and services. However, recent indications of a resurgence of the virus in certain regions and the emergence of variants of the virus for which existing vaccines could be less effective have raised concerns about the re-imposition of local restrictions on business activity and a negative effect on consumer behavior that alone, or together, could impede the economic recovery. Sonoco is following these developments closely and will respond with appropriate changes to active production capacity and cost-management initiatives. An extended period of disruption to our served markets or global supply chains could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition. In addition, an extended global recession caused by the pandemic would have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial condition.\nWhile the social distancing response to COVID-19 has resulted in increased consumer demand for certain food and household products, the pandemic's recessionary impact on the worldwide economy has significantly decreased demand in our more economically sensitive industrial related businesses and exacerbated their negative price/cost relationships. As a result, the overall impact of the pandemic on 2020 consolidated results was negative. While we expect the pandemic to continue having a mixed impact on demand for our products in 2021, we expect that demand and mix across our businesses will largely revert to pre-pandemic levels over the course of the year. However, although we expect that, relative to 2020, consolidated results will benefit from this reversion, we still expect a net negative impact to 2021 consolidated earnings relative to pre-pandemic levels and that many of our businesses will continue to experience negative price/cost pressure.\nWe expect our Consumer Packaging segment to experience normal seasonal volume trends in 2021 and to perform well relative to pre-pandemic levels. However, as the pandemic wanes, total volume is expected to be flat year over year as sales of at-home food packaging decline and demand in other consumer market segments picks up. We expect our industrial-related markets to continue experiencing weak but improving demand into the summer or fall, with our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment continuing to face a negative price/cost relationship due to higher year-over-year recycled fiber costs; however, we expect industrial demand will improve more substantially over the back-half of the year if the pandemic continues to subside. Our Protective Solutions and Display and Packaging businesses are expected to benefit from the continued economic recovery.\nFinancial Flexibility and Liquidity\nSonoco has a strong, investment-grade balance sheet and substantial liquidity available in the form of cash, cash equivalents and revolving credit facilities, as well as the ability to issue commercial paper and to access liquidity in the banking and debt capital markets. The following actions taken in 2020 largely related to the Company's efforts to either improve near-term liquidity or secure additional liquidity in light of volatility in the credit markets and economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u2022On March 18, 2020, the Company closed and funded a new $150 million, 364-day term loan, the proceeds from which were used to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper. The Company repaid this loan on July 20, 2020.\n\u2022On April 1, 2020, the Company accessed $250 million from its revolving credit facility, using $85 million of the proceeds to fully repay its then outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company repaid this loan on May 5, 2020.\n\u2022On April 6, 2020, the Company borrowed $100 million pursuant to a new 364-day term loan. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n\u2022On April 22, 2020, the Company sold $600 million of 3.125% notes due May 1, 2030, using a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of existing debt.\n\u2022In May 2020, the Company exercised its one-time option to extend the term of its 364-day, $200 million term loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to May 2021. The Company repaid this loan on October 22, 2020.\n20 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n\u2022On November 30, 2020, the Company repaid the remaining balance of its five-year term loan using proceeds from the sale of its European contract packaging business.\nFollowing the actions above, at December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $565 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, $500 million in committed availability under its revolving credit facility, and scheduled debt maturities in 2021 of approximately $456 million.\nHealth, Safety and Business Continuity\nThe health and safety of Sonoco's associates, contractors, suppliers and the general public are a top priority. Included among the safety measures we have recently implemented are: conducting health screenings for personnel entering our operations, routinely cleaning high-touch surfaces, following social distancing protocols, prohibiting all non-critical business travel, and encouraging all associates who can to work from home when possible. Additionally, Sonoco has launched a dedicated COVID-19 internal microsite to keep its associates up to date on Company and health authority information, guidelines, protocols and policies, including those set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSonoco has also put in place a Global Task Force to develop and implement business continuity plans to ensure its operations are as prepared as possible to be able to continue producing and shipping product to its customers without disruption. Sonoco has a diverse global supply chain and to date has not experienced significant raw material or other supply disruptions.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, non-operating pension costs, certain income tax events and adjustments, and other items, if any, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company consistently applies its non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein and uses them for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 24 and 25 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2020 overview and 2021 outlook\nManagement's primary focus areas in 2020 were profitable growth, improving margins, improving cash flow, and sustainability. Overall, management was expecting a notable increase in net sales, largely driven by the full-year impact of 2019 acquisitions, and modest improvements in overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization. Management had targeted an overall 2020 organic volume increase of approximately 1.0% and was expecting a negative price/cost relationship. Manufacturing and other productivity gains were expected to offset a significant portion of projected increases in labor and other costs.\nHowever, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, management's focus quickly turned to addressing the many unprecedented issues and challenges the pandemic presented, including protecting workers' safety, simultaneously accelerating production of products that experienced a surge in demand and scaling down operations producing products that experienced sharp declines, and managing the ensuing volatility in material costs and financial markets.\nAs noted above, the pandemic had wide-ranging impacts on the operations and financial results of our various businesses, both positive and negative. Despite the full-year benefit of 2019 acquisitions, overall sales declined 2.5%, reflecting reduced demand in our more economically sensitive industrial-related businesses, partially offset by increased demand in our Consumer Packaging segment, particularly food packaging.\nGAAP operating profit declined $109.3 million from the prior year largely driven by higher restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as a loss on the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business. In 2020, the Company recorded after-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges of $112.7 million, which were largely attributable to its perimeter-of-the-store thermoforming operations on the west coast of\n21 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nthe United States and in Mexico. Despite the decline in GAAP operating profit, total segment operating profit (referred to as base operating profit) was essentially unchanged from the prior year. A recession-induced decline in the Paper and Industrial Related Products segment was almost fully offset by an increase in Consumer Packaging operating profit driven by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand for certain food and household products. Overall, net productivity gains were able to offset lower volume as well as a negative price cost relationship.\nCurrent year gross profit was $1,046.3 million, compared with $1,057.8 million in 2019. Despite the small decline, gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to 20.0%, compared to 19.7% in 2019. GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were relatively flat as decreases due to a focus on managing costs, together with the impact of the pandemic on travel, employee medical and other expenses were partially offset by additional SG&A expenses from acquired businesses.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2020 decreased 28.9%, or $84.3 million, from 5.4% of sales to 4.0% of sales, reflecting the decline in operating profit as well as higher net interest expense. Although base operating profit was essentially unchanged, base earnings attributable to Sonoco declined 3.3%, or $11.7 million, year over year, reflecting the higher net interest expense and a somewhat higher effective base income tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 20.7%, compared with 24.5% in 2019, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 25.1%, compared with 23.9% in 2019. The year-over-year decrease in the GAAP tax rate was driven primarily by the sale of the Company's European contract packaging business and a related write down of the deferred tax liability on goodwill. The increase in the effective tax rate on base earnings in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nOn August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands the Company's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. This transaction, and the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in January 2020, are described in greater detail below. On November 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its European contract packaging business which was a component of the Display and Packaging segment.\nOn July 17, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution to terminate the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\") effective September 30, 2019. Approval of the termination was received from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in 2020. Following completion of a limited lump-sum offering, the Company is expected to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan through the purchases of annuities in mid 2021. In anticipation of settling these liabilities, the Company took measures beginning in 2019 to derisk the Inactive Plan's assets by investing them in a conservative mix of primarily fixed income investments. During 2020, the Company recorded total pension and postretirement benefit expenses of approximately $58.0 million, compared with $52.7 million during 2019. The increased expense was primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets as a result of a full year's impact of the derisking of the Inactive Plan portfolio. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans remained at $294 million at the end of both 2020 and 2019 as increases in plan liabilities from interest and lower discount rates were offset by increases in plan assets from Company contributions and investment returns.\nThe Company generated $705.6 million in cash from operations during 2020, compared with $425.9 million in 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the approximately $165 million after-tax voluntary contribution to the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. Cash generated from operations also improved due to the deferral of payments of the Company's portion of social security taxes pursuant to the CARES Act and a cash tax benefit generated by the expected funding in mid-2021 of the Inactive Plan as the obligations of the plan are settled.\nOutlook\nManaging through the pandemic will continue to be a primary focus in 2021; however, the Company also expects to drive profitable growth, expand gross profit margin and enhance sustainability in our operations and our product lines. Key to achieving management's objectives for 2021 and beyond will be a strategy to invest in ourselves and product markets where we have competitive advantages and can be value adding. A prime example of this strategy is the Company's $114 million investment in Project Horizon announced earlier in 2020, which will convert the Hartsville corrugated medium machine to be able to produce uncoated recycled paperboard. The scope of the project was expanded to include a finished goods warehouse and other infrastructure improvements to the Hartsville paper manufacturing complex. When completed in 2022, Project Horizon is estimated to drive approximately $30 million in annualized cost savings. In addition, the Company will work to further develop its previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2021 of approximately 2.0% driven largely by a continuation of the economic recovery and a steady return to pre-pandemic demand levels across our businesses. In addition, the Company expects to benefit from growth in chilled and prepared food volume, improved perimeter of the store performance, new sustainable products, and growth in our medical and retail security businesses. The Company will also continue to look for strategic and opportunistic acquisition candidates as well as opportunities to optimize our overall business portfolio.\nThe Company has projected that company-wide price/cost will be negative in 2021 due to higher year-over-year prices in key raw materials, such as recycled fiber and plastic resins, and higher freight costs. Manufacturing and other productivity gains are expected to offset a significant portion of the negative price/cost impact and projected increases in labor and other costs; however, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2021 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from the August 2020 Can Packaging acquisition, but will not include the revenue and profit of the European contract packaging business sold November 30, 2020; together, these items are estimated to have a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $240 million on revenue and a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $0.14 on diluted earnings per share.\nThe Company projects the operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense will be approximately $1 million higher year over year, while the non-operating component, excluding settlement charges, is projected to be $13 million lower. The net anticipated decrease of $12 million is due primarily to recognition of only a partial year of expenses related to the Inactive Plan which is expected to be fully settled by the end of the second quarter 2021. Non-cash, non-base, pretax settlement charges totaling approximately $560 million are expected to be recognized in 2021 as the liabilities of the Inactive Plan, terminated in 2019, are settled through lump-sum payouts and annuity purchases. The Company anticipates making an additional contribution to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in mid-2021 in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time of the annuity purchase. Contributions to all other defined benefit plans in 2021 are expected to total approximately $15 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported 2021 net sales will stay relatively flat at approximately $5.2 billion and overall margins for gross profit will improve approximately 0.8% over 2020. Base operating profit as a percent of sales is expected to remain at approximately 10.1%.\nCash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $585 million in 2021. Absent additional borrowings for acquisitions or significant changes in interest rates, net interest expense is expected to be lower year over year by approximately $12 million primarily due to lower average borrowing levels. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be approximately 25.4% in 2021 compared with 25.1% in 2020.\n22 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nAs noted below, the Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results. However, due to the magnitude of the pension settlement charges expected to be recognized in 2021, as described above, the Company anticipates it will report a GAAP net loss for the year.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2020 at a cost of $49.4 million, net of cash acquired. On August 3, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Can Packaging, a privately owned designer and manufacturer of sustainable paper packaging and related manufacturing equipment, based in Habsheim, France, for $45.5 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This settlement occurred in January 2021 and resulted in the Company making an additional cash payment of approximately $1.6 million. Can Packaging operates two paper can manufacturing facilities in France, along with a research and development center where it designs and builds patented packaging machines and sealing equipment. The acquisition of Can Packaging expands Sonoco's ability to provide innovative recyclable packaging in various shapes and sizes. The operations of Can Packaging are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On January 10, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of a small tube and core operation in Jacksonville, Florida, from Design Containers, Inc. (\"Jacksonville\"), for total cash consideration of $4.0 million. The operations of Jacksonville are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2019 at a cost of $297.9 million, net of cash acquired. On December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Thermoform Engineered Quality, LLC, and Plastique Holdings, LTD, (together \"TEQ\") for $187.3 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing and resulted in the receipt of cash from the sellers totaling $0.2 million in April 2020. The acquired operations consist of three thermoforming and extrusion facilities in the United States along with a thermoforming operation in the United Kingdom and a thermoforming and molded-fiber operation in Poland, which together employ approximately 500 associates. The acquisition of TEQ provides a strong platform to further expand Sonoco's growing healthcare packaging business. The operations of TEQ are reported in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment. On August 9, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Corenso for $110.6 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing which was settled in November 2019 requiring an additional cash payment to the sellers of approximately $0.1 million. Corenso is a leading manufacturer of uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) and high-performance cores used in the paper, packaging films, tape, and specialty industries. Corenso operates a 108,000-ton per year URB mill and core converting facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as a core converting facility in Richmond, Virginia, expanding the Company's ability to produce a wide variety of sustainable coreboard grades. The operations of Corenso are reported in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company made final contingent payments totaling $3.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for acquisitions completed in prior years. In 2020 the Company settled a $2.5 million contingent purchase obligation related to the 2018 acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\") based on certain sales metrics being met and a $0.5 million contingent purchase liability related to the 2016 acquisition of AAR Corporation (\"AAR\"). In 2019 the Company settled additional contingent purchase obligations related to Highland and AAR totaling $5.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The payment of these contingent obligations are reflected as financing activities on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company completed the divestiture of its European contract packaging business, Sonoco Poland Packaging Services Sp. z.o.o. to a subsidiary of Prairie Industries Holdings, a Wisconsin-based contract packaging and contract manufacturing firm backed by The Halifax Group. These operations provided full-service custom packaging and supply chain management solutions to global consumer product goods companies from three locations in Poland with approximately 2,600 employees. The selling price of $120 million was adjusted at closing for certain indebtedness assumed by the buyer and for anticipated differences between targeted levels of working capital and the projected levels at the time of closing. The Company received net cash proceeds at closing of $105.9 million, with the buyer funding an escrow account with an additional $4.6 million, of which $4.0 million is expected to be released to the Company upon final sales adjustments in the first quarter of 2021, and the remainder, pending any indemnity claims, in the second quarter of 2022. The Company also anticipates that final working capital settlements will result in additional cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Transaction fees totaling $2.5 million were paid out of the proceeds received. Cumulative currency translation adjustment losses of $12.4 million associated with this entity were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a part of the net loss on the sale of the business which totaled $14.5 million. The decision to sell the European contract packaging business was part of the Company's efforts to simplify its operating structure to focus on growing its core Consumer and Industrial packaging businesses. The disposition of these operations is expected to negatively impact the 2021 year-over-year sales comparison by approximately $260 million. This sale is not expected to notably affect operating margin percentages nor does it represent a strategic shift for the Company that will have a major effect on its operations and financial results.\nThe Company continually assesses its operational footprint as well as its overall portfolio of businesses and may consider the disposition of plants and/or business units it considers to be suboptimal or nonstrategic. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\n23 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (approximately 320 locations in 34 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges for"}
