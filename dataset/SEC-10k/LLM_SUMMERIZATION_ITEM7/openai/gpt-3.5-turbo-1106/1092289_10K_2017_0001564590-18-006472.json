Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have focused our operations in countries that have established, yet underexplored, petroleum systems, are net importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. As of December 31, 2017, we held interests in approximately 367,000 and 163,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria, respectively. As of March 16, 2018, approximately 47% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.\n2017 Financial and Operational Performance\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We derived 94.8% of our revenues from the production of oil, 3.2% of our revenues from the production of natural gas and 2.0% of our revenues from other sources during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased 12.5% to $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe which resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 per Boe. This resulted in higher revenues of $9.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Wellhead production was 1,104 Mbbls of oil and 376 Mmcf of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 1,376 Mbbls of oil and 1,431 Mmcf of natural gas for 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In 2017, we incurred $20.6 million in total capital expenditures, including license acquisition, seismic and corporate expenditures, from continuing operations, as compared to $10.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2017, we had $13.0 million in long-term debt, $15.6 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million in Series A Preferred Shares, as compared to $3.8 million in long-term debt, $38.2 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million Series A Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey\nExploration. We drilled the Cavuslu-1 well to a total depth of 11,350 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $1.7 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan as well as Dadas, Hazro and Mardin potential in the well. The well tested high gravity oil and gas in the two Bedinan sand benches. Testing will continue throughout the first half of 2018 to establish the potential of these intervals as well as up-hole potential in the well.\nWe drilled the Bahar-11 well, which was initially planned as a horizontal well but was ultimately completed as a vertical well, to a total depth of 10,750 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $4.8 million. Commercial oil was discovered in the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations with a combined test rate of 280 Bopd. The well was brought on production at a commingled rate of 140 Bopd.\nWe drilled the Pinar-1ST well to a total depth of 11,650 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $2.0 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan, the lower of which tested non-commercial amounts of hydrocarbons and the upper of which is being produced intermittently and tested at an initial rate of 37 Bopd unstimulated. The well has not yet been fracture stimulated, completions operations are ongoing, and the full production potential has not been established. The well test represents a commercial discovery in the block, and applications for a production license are underway. We also encountered Mardin and Hazro zones, which we expect to test in 2018.\nSeismic. We acquired approximately 116 square miles of new 3D seismic data during the summer of 2017 as an extension to our existing 3D seismic coverage in the Molla Area of southeast Turkey. The new 3D seismic data is being processed with anticipated completion in April 2018. The new 3D seismic data is being merged with our existing seismic data to create one continuous 3D seismic survey across all of our acreage in the Molla Area.\nRecompletions. In the Arpatepe, Bahar, and Selmo fields, several recompletions were executed, which resulted in incremental production of 275 Bopd for an approximate capital expenditure of $1.25 million.\nFacilities. We completed construction of an enhanced production facility in the Bahar field and the partial electrification of the field via natural gas-powered generation. Now fully operational, the facility has effectively reduced field operating expenses by 30% increasing both field reserves and net backs.\nWe began construction in the Selmo field to expand the field's existing produced water disposal system. We expect to increase the field handling capacity by between 50% and 100% through the conversion of suspended wells to disposal wells and the expansion of the high-pressure water disposal distribution network.\nNorthwestern Turkey\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in northwestern Turkey during 2017. We have converted our gas sales system at Edirne field from high pressure to low pressure.\nBulgaria\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in Bulgaria during 2017.\nCurrent Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey.\nSelmo\nIn January 2018, we spud the Selmo-81H2 well, which is the first of a six-well Selmo development program. Drilling is ongoing, and we expect to start completions operations in the first half of 2018.\nBahar\nWe expect to drill one development well in the Bahar field in 2018. We may drill an additional Bahar exploration well, contingent on financing.\nMolla\nWe are currently preparing the location for the Yeniev-1 exploration well, targeting the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations. We expect to spud the Yeniev-1 in the second quarter of 2018.\nNorthwestern Turkey. We continue to evaluate our prospects in the Thrace Basin in light of the recent positive production test results at the Yamalik-1 exploration well operated by Valeura with their partner Statoil. The Yamalik-1 exploration well is directly adjacent to our 120,000 net acres in the Thrace Basin of which we believe approximately 50,000 net acres (100% WI, 87.5% NRI) is analogous to the Valeura and Statoil acreage. We expect to resume production operations on our Yildurm-1 well on the Temrez license in 2018. Contingent on financing, we may commence a drilling program on our Temrez license in 2018.\nBulgaria. We continue to evaluate our position in Bulgaria with updated geologic models. We have prepared plans to side track and re-drill the Devinci R-1 well, which we plan to commence in 2018, contingent on financing.\nPlanned Operations\nWe expect our net field capital expenditures for 2018 to range between $27.0 million and $30.0 million. We expect net field capital expenditures during 2018 to include between $23.0 million and $26.0 million in drilling and completion expense for eight planned wells and approximately $4.0 million in recompletions. We expect that any additional 2018 expenditures would be invested in the Selmo, Bahar and Molla fields in southeastern Turkey and the Koynare license in Bulgaria. We expect that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our 2018 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2018 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3-Significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third parties, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties. In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, costs of productive wells, developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves, and exploration well costs and additional development costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved developed reserves. Proceeds from the sale of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be non-productive. The determination of an exploratory well's ability to produce generally must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated impairment provisions, until such leases are transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d). ASC 360 requires that our long-lived assets be assessed for potential impairment of their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred. Proved oil and natural gas properties are evaluated by field for potential impairment. An impairment on proved properties is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of a field are less than its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the carrying value of the impaired field is reduced to its estimated fair value, which is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nUnproved oil and natural gas properties do not have producing properties and are valued on acquisition by management, with the assistance of an independent expert when necessary. As reserves are proved through the successful completion of exploratory wells, the cost is transferred to proved properties. The cost of the remaining unproved basis is periodically evaluated by management to assess whether the value of a property has diminished. To do this assessment, management considers (i) estimated potential reserves and future net revenues from an independent expert, (ii) our history in exploring the area, (iii) our future drilling plans per its capital drilling program prepared by our reservoir engineers and operations management, and (iv) other factors associated with the area. Impairment is taken on the unproved property value if it is determined that the costs are not likely to be recoverable. The valuation is subjective and requires management to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We follow ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d) and ASC 810-10-65, Consolidation. ASC 805 requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value.\u201d The statement applies to all business combinations, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. Under ASC 805, all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement. We follow ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters ( ASC 830\u201d) which requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. The functional currency for each of our subsidiaries in Turkey and Bulgaria is the local currency. For certain entities, translation adjustments result from the process of translating the functional currency of the foreign operation's financial statements into our U.S. Dollar reporting currency, which is a non-cash transaction. These translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nASC 830 requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. Exchange gains or losses from re-measuring transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency are included in current earnings.\nOil and Gas Reserves. The estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are estimated in accordance with the rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d). These rules require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions using a trailing 12-month average price with no provision for price and cost escalations in future years except by contractual arrangements. We engaged DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, to independently evaluate our Turkey and Bulgaria properties that result in estimates for all of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017.\nReserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. It is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenues, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties, or any combination of the above may be increased or decreased. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nIncome Taxes. We follow the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under this method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Reporting Rules\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, its final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers and requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 has been amended several times with subsequent ASUs including ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. The guidance under these standards is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. We have adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We have a small number of contracts with customers and have identified transactions within the scope of the standard. We are in the process of reviewing each of the contracts and transactions within the scope of the new standard. Based on our preliminary assessment, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a result of adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have determined that it will change its method of recording certain transportation and processing charges that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenues to record such charges as an expense under the new standard. Such changes are not expected to result in a material change in our controls and processes.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of assets on the balance sheet. The guidance requires adoption by application of a modified retrospective transition approach for existing long-term leases and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. Oil and natural gas leases are scoped out of the new ASU. As of December 31, 2017, we currently have 20 operating leases within the scope of this standard and the last lease expires in 2022. The effect of this guidance relating to our existing long-term leases is expected to require additional disclosures, and we are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU would have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The amended guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, clarifies Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, such that an entity must apply modification accounting to changes in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award unless all of the following criteria are met: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification and the ASU indicates that if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique used to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification; (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the modification; and (3) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the modification; the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. We expect the adoption of this ASU will only impact consolidated financial statements if there is a modification to its share-based award agreements.\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 815. The new standard provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption as of the date of issuance is permitted. The new standard does not impact accounting for derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. We do not currently account for any of our derivative position as accounting hedges.\nWe have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these recent pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations.\nResults of Continuing Operations-Year Ended

Total oil and natural gas sales decreased $7.9 million to $55.5 million in 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe due to a natural decline in oil production and a 190 Mboe decrease from the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017. This resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 to $47.58 per Boe in 2017, compared to $39.28 per Boe in 2016.\nSales of Purchased Natural Gas. Sales of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.7 million from $5.0 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017.\nProduction. Production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $12.2 million or $9.16 per Boe (WI), from $12.4 million or $6.70 per Boe (WI) for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2017, reduced headcount and cost-cutting measures in our field operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $2.46 per Boe was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes during 2017 due to the sale of TBNG in February 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. In addition, the increase was due to an increase in workover activity in Bahar and Selmo in 2017.\nExploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs decreased to $0.9 million in 2017, compared to $6.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unproved impairment and exploratory\nexpense of $1.2 million, a decrease in proved property impairment of $2.5 million and in decrease in other impairments of $1.4 million.\nCost of Purchased Natural Gas. Cost of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.6 million from $4.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017\nSeismic and Other Exploration. Seismic and other exploration costs increased to $4.7 million for 2017, compared to $0.1 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in seismic activities during 2017, particularly on our Molla license.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017, compared to $16.3 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives which included a decrease in salary and personnel expenses of $1.5 million due to a reduction in salaries and headcount and a decrease in professional fees and services of $1.9 million.\nDepletion. Depletion expense decreased to $16.0 million or $11.99 per Boe for 2017, compared to $27.4 million or $16.04 per Boe for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in our sales volumes year-over-year and the devaluation of the TRY. The decrease was also due a compressor sale from TEMI to a third party of $1.8 million in 2016 and the sale of TBNG in February 2017.\nInterest and Other Expense. Interest and other expense decreased to $8.8 million in 2017, compared to $11.8 million in 2016.The decrease was primarily due to our lower average debt balances during 2017 versus 2016.\nForeign Exchange Loss. We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $1.9 million in 2017, compared to $3.9 million in 2016. The change in foreign exchange is primarily unrealized (non-cash) in nature and results from the re-measuring of specific transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured at the period-end to the TRY amount if it has not been settled previously. The decrease in foreign exchange loss in 2017 was due to a 7.0% devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2017, compared to a 21.0% devaluation during 2016 and was partially offset by fluctuations in our U.S. Dollar denominated balances in Turkey.\nDeferred Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Deferred income tax (benefit) expense increased to an expense of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $25,000 benefit for 2016. The increase was primarily due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities related to our permanent reinvestment assertion in Turkey and increases in uncertain tax positions, which were partially offset by changes in temporary differences between our U.S. GAAP and statutory balances in Turkey.\nLoss on Commodity Derivative Contracts. During 2017, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $1.9 million, compared to $3.3 million for 2016. In 2017, we recorded a $0.03 million loss on settled contracts and a $1.9 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value. In 2016, we recorded a $7.4 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value and a $4.2 million gain on settled contracts.\nDiscontinued Operations. All revenues and expenses associated with our prior Albanian and Moroccan operations have been classified as discontinued operations. As a result of the divestiture of all of our Albanian oil and gas assets and the reassessment of our Moroccan contingent liabilities, there were no remaining discontinued operations as of December 31, 2017. Our operating results from discontinued operations in Albania and Morocco as of December 31, 2016 are summarized as follows:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Albania\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Excluding sales of purchased natural gas, total oil and natural gas sales decreased to $63.4 million in 2016, from $82.7 million in 2015. Of this decrease, $9.4 million resulted from a lower average realized price per Boe in 2016. Our average price received decreased $5.79 to $39.28 per Boe in 2016, compared to $45.07 per Boe in 2015. Additionally, sales volumes decreased 220 Mboe, primarily from natural gas volumes, which resulted in lower revenues of $9.9 million.\nProduction. Production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased to $12.4 million or $6.70 per Boe (WI), from $12.9 million or $6.14 per Boe (WI) for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2016, fewer workovers, reduced headcount and successful cost-cutting measures in our field operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $0.56 per Boe was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes during 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\nExploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs decreased to $6.0 million in 2016, compared to $21.5 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unproved impairment and exploratory expense of $7.9 million, a decrease in proved property impairment of $3.3 million and in decrease in other impairments of $4.4 million.\nSeismic and Other Exploration. Seismic and other exploration costs decreased to $0.1 million for 2016, compared to $0.4 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in seismic activities during 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $7.8 million to $16.3 million for 2016, compared to $24.1 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives which included a decrease in salary and personnel expenses of $5.8 million due to a reduction in salaries and headcount, a decrease in office and rent expense of $0.6 million, a decrease in accounting and other services of $0.5 million, a decrease in bad debt expense of $0.4 million, and a decrease in travel expense of $0.3 million.\nDepletion. Depletion expense decreased to $27.4 million or $16.04 per Boe for 2016, compared to $35.1 million or $16.73 per Boe for 2015. The decrease was due primarily to fewer additions to proved properties on our Selmo and Bahar fields, a decrease in production volumes during 2016 and a devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2016.\nInterest and Other Expense. Interest and other expense decreased to $11.8 million in 2016, compared to $13.1 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of our prior senior credit facility in August 2016 and replacing it with our $30.0 million term loan with DenizBank (the 2016 Term Loan\u201d) that has a lower interest rate.\nForeign Exchange Loss. We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $3.9 million in 2016, compared to $5.7 million in 2015. The change in foreign exchange is primarily unrealized (non-cash) in nature and results from the re-measuring of specific transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured at the period-end to the TRY amount if it has not been settled previously. The decrease in foreign exchange loss in 2016 was due to a 21.0% devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2016, compared to a 25.4% devaluation during 2015 and is offset by fluctuations in our U.S. Dollar denominated balances in Turkey.\nDeferred Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Deferred income tax (benefit) expense decreased to a benefit of $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an $18.6 million expense for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities related to our permanent reinvestment assertion in Turkey and increases in uncertain tax positions, which were partially offset by changes in temporary differences between our U.S. GAAP and statutory balances in Turkey\n(Loss) Gain on Commodity Derivative Contracts. During 2016, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $3.3 million, compared to a net gain of $27.5 million for 2015. In 2016, we recorded a $4.2 million gain on settled contracts and a $7.4 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value. In 2015, we recorded a $29.6 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value and a $57.1 million gain on settled contracts.\nDiscontinued Operations. All revenues and expenses associated with our Albanian and Moroccan operations have been classified as discontinued operations.

Actual results include revenues and expenses from November 18, 2014 to December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nFor 2017, we incurred $20.6 million in total capital expenditures, including license acquisition, seismic and corporate expenditures from continuing operations, compared to $10.3 million for 2016.\nWe expect our net field capital expenditures for 2018 to range between $27.0 million and $30.0 million. We expect net field capital expenditures during 2018 to include between $23.0 million and $26.0 million in drilling and completion expense for eight planned wells and approximately $4.0 million in recompletions. We expect that any additional 2018 expenditures would be invested in the Selmo, Bahar and Molla fields in southeastern Turkey and the Koynare license in Bulgaria. We expect that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our 2018 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2018 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity for 2017 were our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan and our additional $20.4 million term loan with DenizBank (the 2017 Term Loan\u201d), and the net proceeds from the sale of TBNG. At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million, $13.0 million in long-term debt, $15.6 million in short-term debt and a working capital surplus of $12.8 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $10.0 million, $3.8 million in long-term debt, $38.2 million in short-term debt and a working capital deficit of $17.3 million (excluding assets and liabilities held for sale) at December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2017, we paid off and retired our 13.0% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d) that matured on July 1, 2017, closed the sale of TBNG for gross proceeds of $20.7 million and net cash proceeds of $16.1 million. In addition, we entered into the 2017 Term Loan under our general credit agreement with DenizBank (the Credit Agreement\u201d).\nBased on current forecasted oil prices for 2018 and beyond, we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash on hand are sufficient to conduct our planned operations and meet our contractual requirements, including license obligations through March 31, 2019.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2017 was $17.9 million, a decrease from net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $21.6 million in 2016, due primarily to a decrease in cash settlements on our commodity derivative contracts and a decrease in our oil and natural gas revenues, which was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses.\nNet cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during 2017 increased to $3.7 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $8.5 million in 2016, due primarily to the sale of TBNG. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $13.4 million in 2017, compared to net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of $7.4 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the Series A Preferred Shares offering in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $28.7 million of debt and $46.1 million of Series A Preferred Shares outstanding, which are discussed below.\nSeries A Preferred Shares. On November 4, 2016, we issued 921,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Shares. Of the 921,000 Series A Preferred Shares, (i) 815,000 shares were issued in exchange for $40.75 million aggregate principal amount of our 2017 Notes, at an exchange rate of 20 Series A Preferred Shares for each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, and (ii) 106,000 shares were issued and sold to certain holders of the 2017 Notes. All of the Series A Preferred Shares were issued at a value of $50.00 per share, raising gross proceeds of $5.3 million. We used $4.3 million of the gross proceeds to redeem a portion of the remaining 2017 Notes. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The Series A Preferred Shares contain a substantive conversion option, are mandatorily redeemable and convert into a fixed number of common shares. As a result, under U.S GAAP, we have classified the Series A Preferred Shares within mezzanine equity in our consolidated balance sheet.\nPursuant to the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Shares (the Certificate of Designations\u201d), each Series A Preferred Share may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 45.754 common shares (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $1.0928 per common share and is subject to customary adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other fundamental changes).\nIf not converted sooner, on November 4, 2024, we are required to redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares in cash at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. At any time on or after November 4, 2020, we may redeem all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Shares at the redemption prices listed below (expressed as a percentage of the liquidation preference amount per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption, if the closing sale price of the common shares equals or exceeds 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 10 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 20 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day of such 20 trading day period, ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the business day on which we issue a notice of optional redemption. The redemption prices for the 12-month period starting on the date below are:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> Period Commencing\n</td> <td> Redemption Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 4, 2020\n</td> <td> 105.000%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 4, 2021\n</td> <td> 103.000%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 4, 2022\n</td> <td> 101.000%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 4, 2023 and thereafter\n</td> <td> 100.000%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we are required to offer to redeem the Series A Preferred Shares within 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurred, for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at our election in cash, common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at an annual dividend rate of 12.0% of the liquidation preference if paid all in cash or 16.0% of the liquidation preference if paid in common shares. If paid partially in cash and partially in common shares, the dividend rate on the cash portion is 12.0%, and the dividend rate on the common share portion is 16.0%. Dividends are payable quarterly, on June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of each year. The holders of the Series A Preferred Shares are also entitled to participate pro-rata in any dividends paid on the common shares on an as-converted-to-common shares basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $2.6 million in cash and issued 2,591,384 common shares as dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares. We paid the December 31, 2017 quarterly dividend in cash on January 2, 2018.\nExcept as required by Bermuda law, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares have no voting rights, except that for so long as at least 400,000 Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares voting as a separate class have the right to elect two directors to our Board of Directors. For so long as between 80,000 and 399,999 Series A Preferred Shares are outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares voting as a separate class have the right to elect one director to our Board of Directors. Upon less than 80,000 Series A Preferred Shares remaining outstanding, any directors elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall immediately resign from our Board of Directors.\nThe Certificate of Designation also provides that without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, we will not issue indebtedness for money borrowed or other securities which are senior to the Series A Preferred Shares in excess of the greater of (i) $100 million or (ii) 35% of Company's PV-10 of proved reserves as disclosed in its most recent independent reserve report filed or furnished on EDGAR.\n2016 Term Loan. On August 31, 2016, DenizBank entered into the 2016 Term Loan with TransAtlantic Exploration Mediterranean International Pty Ltd ( TEMI\u201d). In addition, we and DenizBank entered into additional agreements with respect to up to $20.0 million of non-cash facilities, including guarantee letters and treasury instruments for future hedging transactions. On September 7, 2016, TEMI used approximately $22.9 million of the proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan to repay in full our prior senior credit facility.\nThe 2016 Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% (plus 0.2625% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum and was payable in six monthly installments of $1.25 million each through February 2017 and thereafter in twelve monthly installments of $1.88 million each through February 2018. On April 27, 2017, TEMI and DenizBank approved a revised amortization schedule for the 2016 Term Loan. Pursuant to the revised amortization schedule, the maturity date of the 2016 Term Loan was extended from February 2018 to June 2018, and the monthly principal payments were reduced from $1.88 million to $1.38 million. The other terms of the 2016 Term Loan remain unchanged. Amounts repaid under the 2016 Term Loan may not be re-borrowed, and early repayments under the 2016 Term Loan are subject to early repayment fees.\nThe 2016 Term Loan is guaranteed by DMLP, TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Turkey\u201d), Talon Exploration, Ltd. ( Talon Exploration\u201d) and TransAtlantic Worldwide (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d).\nThe 2016 Term Loan contains standard prohibitions on the activities of TEMI as the borrower, including prohibitions on granting of liens on its assets, incurring additional debt, dissolving, liquidating, merging, consolidating, paying dividends, making certain investments, selling assets or transferring revenue, and other similar matters. In addition, the 2016 Term Loan prohibits Amity Oil International Pty Ltd ( Amity\u201d) and Petrogas Petrol Gaz ve Petrokimya Urunleri Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. ( Petrogas\u201d) from incurring additional debt. An event of default under the 2016 Term Loan includes, among other events, failure to pay principal or interest when due, breach of certain covenants, representations, warranties and obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency and the occurrence of a material adverse effect.\nThe 2016 Term Loan is secured by a pledge of (i) the stock of TEMI, DMLP, TransAtlantic Turkey and Talon Exploration, (ii) substantially all of the assets of TEMI, (iii) certain real estate owned by Petrogas, (iv) the Gundem real estate and Muratli real estate owned by Gundem and (v) certain Diyarbakir real estate owned 80% by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd and 20% by Selami Erdem Uras. In addition, TEMI assigned its Turkish collection accounts and its receivables from the sale of oil to Denizbank as additional security for the 2016 Term Loan. Gundem is beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell, his adult children, and Mr. Uras. Mr. Mitchell is our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors. Mr. Uras is our vice president, Turkey.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $8.3 million outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan and no availability, and we were in compliance with the covenants in the 2016 Term Loan.\n2017 Term Loan. On November 17, 2017, Denizbank entered into the 2017 Term Loan with TEMI under the Credit Agreement. We will use the proceeds from the 2017 Term Loan for general corporate purposes.\nThe 2017 Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% (plus 0.3% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum. The 2017 Term Loan has a grace period which bears no interest or payments due until July 2018 and then is payable in one monthly installment of $1.38 million, nine monthly installments of $1.2 million each through April 2019 and thereafter in eight monthly installments of $1.0 million each through December 2019, with the exception of one monthly installment of $1.2 million occurring in October 2019. The 2017 Term Loan matures in December 2019. Amounts repaid under the 2017 Term Loan may not be re-borrowed, and early repayments under the 2017 Term Loan are subject to early repayment fees. The 2017 Term Loan is guaranteed by the Guarantors.\nThe 2017 Term Loan contains standard prohibitions on the activities of TEMI as the borrower, including prohibitions on granting of liens on its assets, incurring additional debt, dissolving, liquidating, merging, consolidating, paying dividends, making certain investments, selling assets or transferring revenue, and other similar matters.

Gundem is beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell, his adult children, and Mr. Uras. Mr. Mitchell is our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors. Mr. Uras is our vice president, Turkey.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $20.4 million outstanding under the 2017 Term Loan and no availability, and we were in compliance with the covenants in the 2017 Term Loan.\n2017 Notes. The 2017 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 20, 2015 (the Indenture\u201d), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d). The 2017 Notes bore interest at an annual rate of 13.0% per annum. Interest was payable semi-annually, in arrears, on January 1 and July 1 of each year.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have focused our operations in countries that have established, yet underexplored, petroleum systems, are net importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. As of December 31, 2017, we held interests in approximately 367,000 and 163,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria, respectively. As of March 16, 2018, approximately 47% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.\n2017 Financial and Operational Performance\n \u2022 We derived 94.8% of our revenues from the production of oil, 3.2% of our revenues from the production of natural gas and 2.0% of our revenues from other sources during the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased 12.5% to $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe which resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 per Boe. This resulted in higher revenues of $9.7 million. \n \u2022 Wellhead production was 1,104 Mbbls of oil and 376 Mmcf of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 1,376 Mbbls of oil and 1,431 Mmcf of natural gas for 2016. \n \u2022 In 2017, we incurred $20.6 million in total capital expenditures, including license acquisition, seismic and corporate expenditures, from continuing operations, as compared to $10.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2016. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2017, we had $13.0 million in long-term debt, $15.6 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million in Series A Preferred Shares, as compared to $3.8 million in long-term debt, $38.2 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million Series A Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2016. \n2017 Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey\nExploration. We drilled the Cavuslu-1 well to a total depth of 11,350 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $1.7 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan as well as Dadas, Hazro and Mardin potential in the well. The well tested high gravity oil and gas in the two Bedinan sand benches. Testing will continue throughout the first half of 2018 to establish the potential of these intervals as well as up-hole potential in the well.\nWe drilled the Bahar-11 well, which was initially planned as a horizontal well but was ultimately completed as a vertical well, to a total depth of 10,750 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $4.8 million. Commercial oil was discovered in the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations with a combined test rate of 280 Bopd. The well was brought on production at a commingled rate of 140 Bopd.\nWe drilled the Pinar-1ST well to a total depth of 11,650 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $2.0 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan, the lower of which tested non-commercial amounts of hydrocarbons and the upper of which is being produced intermittently and tested at an initial rate of 37 Bopd unstimulated. The well has not yet been fracture stimulated, completions operations are ongoing, and the full production potential has not been established. The well test represents a commercial discovery in the block, and applications for a production license are underway. We also encountered Mardin and Hazro zones, which we expect to test in 2018.\nSeismic. We acquired approximately 116 square miles of new 3D seismic data during the summer of 2017 as an extension to our existing 3D seismic coverage in the Molla Area of southeast Turkey. The new 3D seismic data is being processed with anticipated completion in April 2018. The new 3D seismic data is being merged with our existing seismic data to create one continuous 3D seismic survey across all of our acreage in the Molla Area.\nRecompletions. In the Arpatepe, Bahar, and Selmo fields, several recompletions were executed, which resulted in incremental production of 275 Bopd for an approximate capital expenditure of $1.25 million.\nFacilities. We completed construction of an enhanced production facility in the Bahar field and the partial electrification of the field via natural gas-powered generation. Now fully operational, the facility has effectively reduced field operating expenses by 30% increasing both field reserves and net backs.\nWe began construction in the Selmo field to expand the field's existing produced water disposal system. We expect to increase the field handling capacity by between 50% and 100% through the conversion of suspended wells to disposal wells and the expansion of the high-pressure water disposal distribution network.\nNorthwestern Turkey\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in northwestern Turkey during 2017. We have converted our gas sales system at Edirne field from high pressure to low pressure.\nBulgaria\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in Bulgaria during 2017.\nCurrent Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey.\nSelmo\nIn January 2018, we spud the Selmo-81H2 well, which is the first of a six-well Selmo development program. Drilling is ongoing, and we expect to start completions operations in the first half of 2018.\nBahar\nWe expect to drill one development well in the Bahar field in 2018. We may drill an additional Bahar exploration well, contingent on financing.\nMolla\nWe are currently preparing the location for the Yeniev-1 exploration well, targeting the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations. We expect to spud the Yeniev-1 in the second quarter of 2018.\nNorthwestern Turkey. We continue to evaluate our prospects in the Thrace Basin in light of the recent positive production test results at the Yamalik-1 exploration well operated by Valeura with their partner Statoil. The Yamalik-1 exploration well is directly adjacent to our 120,000 net acres in the Thrace Basin of which we believe approximately 50,000 net acres (100% WI, 87.5% NRI) is analogous to the Valeura and Statoil acreage. We expect to resume production operations on our Yildurm-1 well on the Temrez license in 2018. Contingent on financing, we may commence a drilling program on our Temrez license in 2018.\nBulgaria. We continue to evaluate our position in Bulgaria with updated geologic models. We have prepared plans to side track and re-drill the Devinci R-1 well, which we plan to commence in 2018, contingent on financing.\nPlanned Operations\nWe expect our net field capital expenditures for 2018 to range between $27.0 million and $30.0 million. We expect net field capital expenditures during 2018 to include between $23.0 million and $26.0 million in drilling and completion expense for eight planned wells and approximately $4.0 million in recompletions. We expect that any additional 2018 expenditures would be invested in the Selmo, Bahar and Molla fields in southeastern Turkey and the Koynare license in Bulgaria. We expect that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our 2018 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2018 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3-Significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third parties, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties. In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, costs of productive wells, developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves, and exploration well costs and additional development costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved developed reserves. Proceeds from the sale of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be non-productive. The determination of an exploratory well's ability to produce generally must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated impairment provisions, until such leases are transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d). ASC 360 requires that our long-lived assets be assessed for potential impairment of their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred. Proved oil and natural gas properties are evaluated by field for potential impairment. An impairment on proved properties is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of a field are less than its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the carrying value of the impaired field is reduced to its estimated fair value, which is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nUnproved oil and natural gas properties do not have producing properties and are valued on acquisition by management, with the assistance of an independent expert when necessary. As reserves are proved through the successful completion of exploratory wells, the cost is transferred to proved properties. The cost of the remaining unproved basis is periodically evaluated by management to assess whether the value of a property has diminished. To do this assessment, management considers (i) estimated potential reserves and future net revenues from an independent expert, (ii) our history in exploring the area, (iii) our future drilling plans per its capital drilling program prepared by our reservoir engineers and operations management, and (iv) other factors associated with the area. Impairment is taken on the unproved property value if it is determined that the costs are not likely to be recoverable. The valuation is subjective and requires management to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We follow ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d) and ASC 810-10-65, Consolidation. ASC 805 requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value.\u201d The statement applies to all business combinations, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. Under ASC 805, all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement. We follow ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters ( ASC 830\u201d) which requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. The functional currency for each of our subsidiaries in Turkey and Bulgaria is the local currency. For certain entities, translation adjustments result from the process of translating the functional currency of the foreign operation's financial statements into our U.S. Dollar reporting currency, which is a non-cash transaction. These translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nASC 830 requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. Exchange gains or losses from re-measuring transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency are included in current earnings.\nOil and Gas Reserves. The estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are estimated in accordance with the rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d). These rules require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions using a trailing 12-month average price with no provision for price and cost escalations in future years except by contractual arrangements. We engaged DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, to independently evaluate our Turkey and Bulgaria properties that result in estimates for all of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017.\nReserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. It is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenues, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties, or any combination of the above may be increased or decreased. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nIncome Taxes. We follow the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under this method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Reporting Rules\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, its final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers and requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 has been amended several times with subsequent ASUs including ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. The guidance under these standards is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. We have adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We have a small number of contracts with customers and have identified transactions within the scope of the standard. We are in the process of reviewing each of the contracts and transactions within the scope of the new standard. Based on our preliminary assessment, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a result of adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have determined that it will change its method of recording certain transportation and processing charges that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenues to record such charges as an expense under the new standard. Such changes are not expected to result in a material change in our controls and processes.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of assets on the balance sheet. The guidance requires adoption by application of a modified retrospective transition approach for existing long-term leases and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. Oil and natural gas leases are scoped out of the new ASU. As of December 31, 2017, we currently have 20 operating leases within the scope of this standard and the last lease expires in 2022. The effect of this guidance relating to our existing long-term leases is expected to require additional disclosures, and we are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU would have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The amended guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, clarifies Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, such that an entity must apply modification accounting to changes in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award unless all of the following criteria are met: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification and the ASU indicates that if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique used to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification; (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the modification; and (3) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the modification; the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. We expect the adoption of this ASU will only impact consolidated financial statements if there is a modification to its share-based award agreements.\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 815. The new standard provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption as of the date of issuance is permitted. The new standard does not impact accounting for derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. We do not currently account for any of our derivative position as accounting hedges.\nWe have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these recent pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations.\nResults of Continuing Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\nOil and Natural Gas Sales. Total oil and natural gas sales decreased $7.9 million to $55.5 million in 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe due to a natural decline in oil production and a 190 Mboe decrease from the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017. This resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 to $47.58 per Boe in 2017, compared to $39.28 per Boe in 2016.\nSales of Purchased Natural Gas. Sales of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.7 million from $5.0 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017.\nProduction. Production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $12.2 million or $9.16 per Boe (WI), from $12.4 million or $6.70 per Boe (WI) for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2017, reduced headcount and cost-cutting measures in our field operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $2.46 per Boe was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes during 2017 due to the sale of TBNG in February 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. In addition, the increase was due to an increase in workover activity in Bahar and Selmo in 2017.\nExploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs decreased to $0.9 million in 2017, compared to $6.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unproved impairment and exploratory\nexpense of $1.2 million, a decrease in proved property impairment of $2.5 million and in decrease in other impairments of $1.4 million.\nCost of Purchased Natural Gas. Cost of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.6 million from $4.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017\nSeismic and Other Exploration. Seismic and other exploration costs increased to $4.7 million for 2017, compared to $0.1 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in seismic activities during 2017, particularly on our Molla license.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017, compared to $16.3 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives which included a decrease in salary and personnel expenses of $1.5 million due to a reduction in salaries and headcount and a decrease in professional fees and services of $1.9 million.\nDepletion. Depletion expense decreased to $16.0 million or $11.99 per Boe for 2017, compared to $27.4 million or $16.04 per Boe for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in our sales volumes year-over-year and the devaluation of the TRY. The decrease was also due a compressor sale from TEMI to a third party of $1.8", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have focused our operations in countries that have established, yet underexplored, petroleum systems, are net importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. As of December 31, 2017, we held interests in approximately 367,000 and 163,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria, respectively. As of March 16, 2018, approximately 47% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.\n2017 Financial and Operational Performance\n \u2022 We derived 94.8% of our revenues from the production of oil, 3.2% of our revenues from the production of natural gas and 2.0% of our revenues from other sources during the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased 12.5% to $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe which resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 per Boe. This resulted in higher revenues of $9.7 million. \n \u2022 Wellhead production was 1,104 Mbbls of oil and 376 Mmcf of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 1,376 Mbbls of oil and 1,431 Mmcf of natural gas for 2016. \n \u2022 In 2017, we incurred $20.6 million in total capital expenditures, including license acquisition, seismic and corporate expenditures, from continuing operations, as compared to $10.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2016. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2017, we had $13.0 million in long-term debt, $15.6 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million in Series A Preferred Shares, as compared to $3.8 million in long-term debt, $38.2 million in short-term debt and $46.1 million Series A Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2016. \n2017 Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey\nExploration. We drilled the Cavuslu-1 well to a total depth of 11,350 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $1.7 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan as well as Dadas, Hazro and Mardin potential in the well. The well tested high gravity oil and gas in the two Bedinan sand benches. Testing will continue throughout the first half of 2018 to establish the potential of these intervals as well as up-hole potential in the well.\nWe drilled the Bahar-11 well, which was initially planned as a horizontal well but was ultimately completed as a vertical well, to a total depth of 10,750 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $4.8 million. Commercial oil was discovered in the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations with a combined test rate of 280 Bopd. The well was brought on production at a commingled rate of 140 Bopd.\nWe drilled the Pinar-1ST well to a total depth of 11,650 feet for a drilling cost of approximately $2.0 million. We encountered two benches of Bedinan, the lower of which tested non-commercial amounts of hydrocarbons and the upper of which is being produced intermittently and tested at an initial rate of 37 Bopd unstimulated. The well has not yet been fracture stimulated, completions operations are ongoing, and the full production potential has not been established. The well test represents a commercial discovery in the block, and applications for a production license are underway. We also encountered Mardin and Hazro zones, which we expect to test in 2018.\nSeismic. We acquired approximately 116 square miles of new 3D seismic data during the summer of 2017 as an extension to our existing 3D seismic coverage in the Molla Area of southeast Turkey. The new 3D seismic data is being processed with anticipated completion in April 2018. The new 3D seismic data is being merged with our existing seismic data to create one continuous 3D seismic survey across all of our acreage in the Molla Area.\nRecompletions. In the Arpatepe, Bahar, and Selmo fields, several recompletions were executed, which resulted in incremental production of 275 Bopd for an approximate capital expenditure of $1.25 million.\nFacilities. We completed construction of an enhanced production facility in the Bahar field and the partial electrification of the field via natural gas-powered generation. Now fully operational, the facility has effectively reduced field operating expenses by 30% increasing both field reserves and net backs.\nWe began construction in the Selmo field to expand the field's existing produced water disposal system. We expect to increase the field handling capacity by between 50% and 100% through the conversion of suspended wells to disposal wells and the expansion of the high-pressure water disposal distribution network.\nNorthwestern Turkey\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in northwestern Turkey during 2017. We have converted our gas sales system at Edirne field from high pressure to low pressure.\nBulgaria\nWe did not engage in any new drilling activities in Bulgaria during 2017.\nCurrent Operations\nSoutheastern Turkey.\nSelmo\nIn January 2018, we spud the Selmo-81H2 well, which is the first of a six-well Selmo development program. Drilling is ongoing, and we expect to start completions operations in the first half of 2018.\nBahar\nWe expect to drill one development well in the Bahar field in 2018. We may drill an additional Bahar exploration well, contingent on financing.\nMolla\nWe are currently preparing the location for the Yeniev-1 exploration well, targeting the Bedinan, Hazro and Mardin formations. We expect to spud the Yeniev-1 in the second quarter of 2018.\nNorthwestern Turkey. We continue to evaluate our prospects in the Thrace Basin in light of the recent positive production test results at the Yamalik-1 exploration well operated by Valeura with their partner Statoil. The Yamalik-1 exploration well is directly adjacent to our 120,000 net acres in the Thrace Basin of which we believe approximately 50,000 net acres (100% WI, 87.5% NRI) is analogous to the Valeura and Statoil acreage. We expect to resume production operations on our Yildurm-1 well on the Temrez license in 2018. Contingent on financing, we may commence a drilling program on our Temrez license in 2018.\nBulgaria. We continue to evaluate our position in Bulgaria with updated geologic models. We have prepared plans to side track and re-drill the Devinci R-1 well, which we plan to commence in 2018, contingent on financing.\nPlanned Operations\nWe expect our net field capital expenditures for 2018 to range between $27.0 million and $30.0 million. We expect net field capital expenditures during 2018 to include between $23.0 million and $26.0 million in drilling and completion expense for eight planned wells and approximately $4.0 million in recompletions. We expect that any additional 2018 expenditures would be invested in the Selmo, Bahar and Molla fields in southeastern Turkey and the Koynare license in Bulgaria. We expect that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our 2018 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2018 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3-Significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third parties, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties. In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, costs of productive wells, developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves, and exploration well costs and additional development costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved developed reserves. Proceeds from the sale of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be non-productive. The determination of an exploratory well's ability to produce generally must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated impairment provisions, until such leases are transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d). ASC 360 requires that our long-lived assets be assessed for potential impairment of their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred. Proved oil and natural gas properties are evaluated by field for potential impairment. An impairment on proved properties is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of a field are less than its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the carrying value of the impaired field is reduced to its estimated fair value, which is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nUnproved oil and natural gas properties do not have producing properties and are valued on acquisition by management, with the assistance of an independent expert when necessary. As reserves are proved through the successful completion of exploratory wells, the cost is transferred to proved properties. The cost of the remaining unproved basis is periodically evaluated by management to assess whether the value of a property has diminished. To do this assessment, management considers (i) estimated potential reserves and future net revenues from an independent expert, (ii) our history in exploring the area, (iii) our future drilling plans per its capital drilling program prepared by our reservoir engineers and operations management, and (iv) other factors associated with the area. Impairment is taken on the unproved property value if it is determined that the costs are not likely to be recoverable. The valuation is subjective and requires management to make estimates and assumptions which, with the passage of time, may prove to be materially different from actual results.\nBusiness Combinations. We follow ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d) and ASC 810-10-65, Consolidation. ASC 805 requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value.\u201d The statement applies to all business combinations, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. Under ASC 805, all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement. We follow ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters ( ASC 830\u201d) which requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. The functional currency for each of our subsidiaries in Turkey and Bulgaria is the local currency. For certain entities, translation adjustments result from the process of translating the functional currency of the foreign operation's financial statements into our U.S. Dollar reporting currency, which is a non-cash transaction. These translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nASC 830 requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. Exchange gains or losses from re-measuring transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency are included in current earnings.\nOil and Gas Reserves. The estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are estimated in accordance with the rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d). These rules require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions using a trailing 12-month average price with no provision for price and cost escalations in future years except by contractual arrangements. We engaged DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, to independently evaluate our Turkey and Bulgaria properties that result in estimates for all of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017.\nReserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. It is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenues, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties, or any combination of the above may be increased or decreased. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nIncome Taxes. We follow the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). Under this method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Reporting Rules\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, its final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers and requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 has been amended several times with subsequent ASUs including ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. The guidance under these standards is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. We have adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We have a small number of contracts with customers and have identified transactions within the scope of the standard. We are in the process of reviewing each of the contracts and transactions within the scope of the new standard. Based on our preliminary assessment, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a result of adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have determined that it will change its method of recording certain transportation and processing charges that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenues to record such charges as an expense under the new standard. Such changes are not expected to result in a material change in our controls and processes.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of assets on the balance sheet. The guidance requires adoption by application of a modified retrospective transition approach for existing long-term leases and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. Oil and natural gas leases are scoped out of the new ASU. As of December 31, 2017, we currently have 20 operating leases within the scope of this standard and the last lease expires in 2022. The effect of this guidance relating to our existing long-term leases is expected to require additional disclosures, and we are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU would have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within\nthose fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The amended guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, clarifies Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, such that an entity must apply modification accounting to changes in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award unless all of the following criteria are met: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification and the ASU indicates that if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique used to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification; (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the modification; and (3) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the modification; the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. We expect the adoption of this ASU will only impact consolidated financial statements if there is a modification to its share-based award agreements.\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 815. The new standard provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption as of the date of issuance is permitted. The new standard does not impact accounting for derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. We do not currently account for any of our derivative position as accounting hedges.\nWe have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these recent pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations.\nResults of Continuing Operations-Year Ended

Total oil and natural gas sales decreased $7.9 million to $55.5 million in 2017, from $63.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 448 Mboe due to a natural decline in oil production and a 190 Mboe decrease from the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017. This resulted in lower revenues of $17.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase in our average realized price which increased $8.30 to $47.58 per Boe in 2017, compared to $39.28 per Boe in 2016.\nSales of Purchased Natural Gas. Sales of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.7 million from $5.0 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017.\nProduction. Production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $12.2 million or $9.16 per Boe (WI), from $12.4 million or $6.70 per Boe (WI) for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the devaluation of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar in 2017, reduced headcount and cost-cutting measures in our field operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $2.46 per Boe was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes during 2017 due to the sale of TBNG in February 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. In addition, the increase was due to an increase in workover activity in Bahar and Selmo in 2017.\nExploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs decreased to $0.9 million in 2017, compared to $6.0 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unproved impairment and exploratory\nexpense of $1.2 million, a decrease in proved property impairment of $2.5 million and in decrease in other impairments of $1.4 million.\nCost of Purchased Natural Gas. Cost of purchased natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $0.6 million from $4.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the divestiture of TBNG in February 2017\nSeismic and Other Exploration. Seismic and other exploration costs increased to $4.7 million for 2017, compared to $0.1 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in seismic activities during 2017, particularly on our Molla license.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017, compared to $16.3 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives which included a decrease in salary and personnel expenses of $1.5 million due to a reduction in salaries and headcount and a decrease in professional fees and services of $1.9 million.\nDepletion. Depletion expense decreased to $16.0 million or $11.99 per Boe for 2017, compared to $27.4 million or $16.04 per Boe for 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in our sales volumes year-over-year and the devaluation of the TRY. The decrease was also due a compressor sale from TEMI to a third party of $1.8"}
