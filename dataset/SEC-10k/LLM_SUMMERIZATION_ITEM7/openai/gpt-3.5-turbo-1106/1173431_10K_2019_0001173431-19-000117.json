The forward-looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date on which they were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by the federal securities laws.\nGlossary of Terms\nIn discussing and analyzing our business, we utilize several metrics and other terms that are defined in the following Glossary of Terms. Italics indicate other defined terms that appear elsewhere in the Glossary. The term \"GAAP\" refers to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAsset-based revenues - Revenues consisting of (1) bank deposit account fees, (2) net interest revenue and (3) investment product fees. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and securities lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances.\nAverage client trades per day - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as daily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\").\nAverage commissions per trade - Total commissions and transaction fee revenues as reported on our consolidated financial statements, less order routing revenue, divided by total trades for the period. Commissions and transaction fee revenues primarily consist of trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities.\nBasis point - When referring to interest rates, one basis point represents one one-hundredth of one percent.\nBank deposit account fees - Revenues generated from a sweep program that is offered to eligible clients of the Company whereby clients' uninvested cash is swept to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts at affiliated and non-affiliated third-party financial institutions participating in the program.\nBeneficiary accounts - Brokerage accounts managed by a custodian, guardian, conservator or trustee on behalf of one or more beneficiaries. Examples include accounts maintained under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), guardianship, conservatorship and trust arrangements and pension or profit plan for small business accounts.\nBrokerage accounts - Accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for securities brokerage activities. The primary types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts, margin accounts, IRA accounts and beneficiary accounts. Futures accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to trade futures and/or options on futures. Forex accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to engage in foreign exchange trading.\nCash accounts - Brokerage accounts that do not have margin account approval.\nClient assets - The total value of cash and securities in brokerage accounts.\nClient cash and money market assets - The sum of all client cash balances, including client credit balances and client cash balances swept into bank deposit accounts or money market mutual funds.\nClient credit balances - Client cash held in brokerage accounts, excluding balances generated by client short sales on which no interest is paid. Interest paid on client credit balances is a reduction of net interest revenue. Client credit balances are included in \"payable to clients\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nClient margin balances - The total amount of cash loaned to clients in margin accounts. Such loans are secured by client assets. Interest earned on client margin balances is a component of net interest revenue. Client margin balances are included in \"receivable from clients, net\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nCommissions and transaction fees - Revenues earned on trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities. Revenues earned on trading commissions includes client trades in common and preferred stock, ETFs, exchange-traded notes, closed-end funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and fixed income securities.\nConsolidated duration - The weighted average remaining years until maturity of our spread-based assets. For purposes of this calculation, floating rate balances are treated as having a one-month duration. Consolidated duration is used in analyzing our aggregate interest rate sensitivity.\nDaily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\") - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as average client trades per day.\nEBITDA - EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure. We consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under our senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nFee-based investment balances - Client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and our programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios on which we earn fee revenues. Fee revenues earned on these balances are included in \"investment product fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nForex accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for foreign exchange trading. Each forex account must be associated with a brokerage account. Forex accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nFunded accounts - All open client accounts with a total liquidation value greater than zero.\nFutures accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for trading in futures and/or options on futures. Each futures account must be associated with a brokerage account. Futures accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nInsured Deposit Account - We are party to an Insured Deposit Account (\"IDA\") agreement with TD Bank USA, N.A. (\"TD Bank USA\"), TD Bank, N.A. and The Toronto-Dominion Bank (\"TD\"). Under the IDA agreement, TD Bank USA and TD Bank, N.A. (together, the \"TD Depository Institutions\") make available to our clients FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts as either designated sweep vehicles or as non-sweep deposit accounts. We provide marketing, recordkeeping and support services for the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts. In exchange for providing these services, the TD Depository\nInstitutions pay us an aggregate marketing fee based on the weighted average yield earned on the client IDA assets, less the actual interest paid to clients, a servicing fee to the TD Depository Institutions and the cost of FDIC insurance premiums. Fee revenues earned under this agreement are included in \"bank deposit account fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest-earning assets - Consist of client margin balances, segregated cash, deposits paid on securities borrowing and other cash and interest-earning investment balances.\nInterest rate-sensitive assets - Consist of spread-based assets and client cash invested in money market mutual funds.\nInvestment product fees - Revenues earned on fee-based investment balances. Investment product fees consists of fees earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and through investment programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios. Investment product fees also includes fees earned on client assets managed by independent registered investment advisors utilizing our trading and investing platforms.\nIRA accounts (Individual Retirement Arrangements) - A personal trust account for the exclusive benefit of a U.S. individual (or his or her beneficiaries) that provides tax advantages in accumulating funds to save for retirement or other qualified purposes. These accounts are subject to numerous restrictions on additions to and withdrawals from the account, as well as prohibitions against certain investments or transactions conducted within the account. We offer traditional, Roth, Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA accounts.\nLiquid assets - Liquid assets is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be an important measure of our liquidity. Liquid assets may be utilized for general corporate purposes and is defined as the sum of (1) corporate cash and cash equivalents, (2) corporate investments, less securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and (3) our regulated subsidiaries' net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management. Corporate cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents from our investment advisory subsidiaries. Liquid assets represents available capital, including any capital from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of established management operational targets. We include the excess capital of our regulated subsidiaries in the calculation of liquid assets, rather than simply including regulated subsidiaries' cash and cash equivalents, because capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management is generally available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Liquid assets is based on more conservative measures of net capital than regulatory requirements because we generally manage to higher levels of net capital at our regulated subsidiaries than the regulatory thresholds require. Liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity, rather than as a substitute for GAAP cash and cash equivalents.\nLiquidation value - The net value of a client's account holdings as of the close of a regular trading session. Liquidation value includes client cash and the value of long security positions, less margin balances and the cost to buy back short security positions. It also includes the value of open futures, foreign exchange and options positions.\nMargin accounts - Brokerage accounts in which clients may borrow from us to buy securities or for any other purpose, subject to regulatory and Company-imposed limitations.\nNet interest margin (\"NIM\") - A measure of the net yield on our average spread-based assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of bank deposit account fees and net interest revenue by average spread-based assets.\nNet interest revenue - Net interest revenue is interest revenues less brokerage interest expense. Interest revenues are generated by charges to clients on margin balances maintained in margin accounts, the investment of cash from operations and segregated cash and interest earned on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense consists of amounts paid or payable to clients based on credit balances maintained in brokerage accounts and interest incurred on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense does not include interest on our non-brokerage borrowings.\nNet new assets - Consists of total client asset inflows, less total client asset outflows, excluding activity from business combinations. Client asset inflows include interest and dividend payments and exclude changes in client\nassets due to market fluctuations. Net new assets are measured based on the market value of the assets as of the date of the inflows and outflows.\nNet new asset growth rate (annualized) - Annualized net new assets as a percentage of client assets as of the beginning of the period.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS - Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") are non-GAAP financial measures. We define non-GAAP net income as net income adjusted to remove the after-tax effect of amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and may be useful in evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating a meaningful comparison of our results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of our underlying business performance. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded as these costs are not representative of the costs of running our on-going business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS.\nOrder routing revenue - Revenues generated from payments and/or rebates received from market centers. Order routing revenue is a component of transaction-based revenues.\nSecurities borrowing - We borrow securities temporarily from other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed, and generally earn interest revenue on the cash deposited with the counterparty. We also incur interest expense for borrowing certain securities.\nSecurities lending - We loan securities temporarily to other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We receive cash as collateral for the securities loaned, and generally incur interest expense on the cash deposited with us. We also earn revenue for lending certain securities.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) - We sell securities to counterparties with an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same securities at a stated price plus interest on a specified date. We utilize repurchase agreements to finance our short-term liquidity and capital needs. Under these financing transactions, we receive cash from counterparties and provide U.S. Treasury securities as collateral.\nSegregated cash - Client cash and investments segregated in compliance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Customer Protection Rule) and other regulations. Interest earned on segregated cash is a component of net interest revenue.\nSpread-based assets - Client and brokerage-related asset balances, consisting of bank deposit account balances and interest-earning assets. Spread-based assets is used in the calculation of our net interest margin and our consolidated duration.\nTotal trades - Revenue-generating client securities trades, which are executed by our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries. Total trades are a significant source of our revenues. Such trades include, but are not limited to, trades in equities, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and debt instruments. Trades generate revenue from commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction fees and/or order routing revenue.\nTrading days - Days in which the U.S. equity markets are open for a full trading session. Reduced exchange trading sessions are treated as half trading days.\nTransaction-based revenues - Revenues generated from client trade execution, consisting primarily of commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction clearing fees and order routing revenue.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nWe provide securities brokerage and clearing services to our clients through our introducing and clearing broker-dealer subsidiaries. We also provide futures and foreign exchange trade execution services to our clients through our futures commission merchant (\"FCM\") and forex dealer member (\"FDM\") subsidiary. Substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services. Our primary focus is\nserving retail investors and traders and independent registered investment advisors by providing services with straightforward, affordable pricing.\nOur largest sources of revenues are asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances. The primary factors driving our transaction-based revenues are total client trades and average commissions per trade. Effective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, exchange traded funds (ETF) (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). For information regarding the expected impact of these price reductions to our net revenues, see \"Results of Operations\" later in this section. We also receive order routing revenue, which results from arrangements we have with many market centers to receive cash payments and/or rebates in exchange for routing orders to these firms for execution. Order routing revenue is included in commissions and transaction fees on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits. Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, group insurance, contributions to benefit programs, recruitment, severance and other related employee costs.\nClearing and execution costs include incremental third-party expenses that tend to fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in client accounts or trades. Examples of expenses included in this category are outsourced clearing services, statement and confirmation processing and postage costs and clearing expenses paid to the National Securities Clearing Corporation, option exchanges and other market centers. Communications expense includes telecommunications, other postage, news and quote costs. Occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces, software licensing and maintenance costs and maintenance expenses on computer hardware and other equipment. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of amounts allocated to the value of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions.\nProfessional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal, accounting, technology, regulatory, marketing and general management issues. Advertising costs include production and placement of advertisements in various media, including online, television, print and email, as well as client promotion and development costs. Advertising expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Other operating expenses include provision for bad debt losses, fraud and error losses, gains or losses on disposal of property, insurance expenses, travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. During fiscal year 2018, other operating expenses also included costs incurred related to the integration of Scottrade.\nInterest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Gain on business-related divestiture represents the gain realized on the sale of TD Ameritrade Trust Company's (\"TDATC\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retirement plan custody and trust assets on June 28, 2019. Loss on sale of investments represents losses realized on corporate (non broker-dealer) investments.\nAcquisition of Scottrade\nOn September 18, 2017, we completed our acquisition of the brokerage business of Scottrade. The transaction combined highly complementary franchises and added significant scale to our retail business with the addition of approximately 3.5 million funded client accounts, extended our leadership in trading, and expanded the size of our branch network.\nFor additional information regarding this acquisition, see Note 2 - Business Acquisition under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results. Note 1, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management's judgments and estimates and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position.\nValuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets\nWe test goodwill and our indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset for impairment on at least an annual basis, or whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the Company as a whole. The estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting unit and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit. No impairment charges have resulted from our goodwill impairment tests.\nTo determine if the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we first assess certain qualitative factors. Based on this assessment, if it is determined that more likely than not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. No impairment charges have resulted from the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests.\nWe review our finite-lived acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period to determine if events or trends warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We have had no events or trends that have warranted a material revision to the originally estimated useful lives.\nEstimates of effective income tax rates, uncertain tax positions, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances\nWe estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current income tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. We must evaluate the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized. To the extent we determine that realization is not \"more likely than not,\" we establish a valuation allowance. Establishing or increasing a valuation allowance results in a corresponding increase to income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance can be reduced or is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, reducing income tax expense.\nWe must make significant judgments to calculate our provision for income taxes, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. We must also exercise judgment in determining the need for, and amount of, any accruals for uncertain tax positions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations to many types of transactions is subject to varying interpretations, amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements could be significantly changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing authorities.\nAccruals for contingent liabilities\nAccruals for contingent liabilities, such as legal and regulatory claims and proceedings, reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter. In making such estimates, we consider many factors, including the progress of the matter, prior experience and the experience of others in similar matters, available defenses, insurance coverage, indemnification provisions and the advice of legal counsel and other experts. In many matters, such as those in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter\nis close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Because matters may be resolved over long periods of time, accruals are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount accrued.\nResults of Operations\nConditions in the U.S. equity markets significantly impact the volume of our clients' trading activity. There is a relationship between the volume of our clients' trading activity and our results of operations. We cannot predict future trading volumes in the U.S. equity markets. If client trading activity increases, we generally expect that it would have a positive impact on our results of operations. If client trading activity declines, we generally expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in average client balances, especially bank deposit account, margin, credit and fee-based investment balances, may significantly impact our results of operations. Changes in interest rates also significantly impact our results of operations. We seek to mitigate interest rate risk by aligning the average duration of our interest-earning assets with that of our interest-bearing liabilities. We cannot predict the direction of interest rates or the levels of client balances. If interest rates rise, we generally expect to earn a larger net interest spread. Conversely, a falling interest rate environment generally would result in us earning a smaller net interest spread.\nEffective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, ETFs (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). The expected impact of these price reductions on our net revenues for fiscal year 2020 is discussed later in this section.\nFinancial Performance Metrics\nNet income, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) are key metrics we use in evaluating our financial performance. Net income and diluted earnings per share are GAAP financial measures and EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under the TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nThe following table sets forth net income in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated, and provides reconciliations to EBITDA (dollars in millions):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018\nOur net income increased 50% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture, partially offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate and interest on borrowings. The effective income tax rate was lower in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") on December 22, 2017.\nOur EBITDA increased 47% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture.\nOur diluted earnings per share increased 53% to $3.96 for fiscal year 2019 compared to $2.59 for fiscal year 2018, due to higher net income and a 2% decrease in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. Details regarding our fiscal year 2020 expectations for net revenues and expenses are presented later in this discussion.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017\nOur net income increased 69% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to an increase in net revenues and a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the enactment of the Act on December 22, 2017. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and interest on borrowings, and an $11 million loss on sale of investments during fiscal year 2018. Net revenues and operating expenses increased primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition.\nOur EBITDA increased 38% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, and an $11 million loss on sale of investments during fiscal year 2018.\nOur diluted earnings per share increased 58% to $2.59 for fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.64 for fiscal year 2017, primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by a 7% increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of our common stock in connection with the Scottrade acquisition.\nOperating Metrics\nOur largest sources of revenues are asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues. For fiscal year 2019, asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues accounted for 64% and 33% of our net revenues, respectively. Asset-based revenues consist of (1) bank deposit account fees, (2) net interest revenue and (3) investment product fees. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances. The primary factors driving our transaction-based revenues are total trades and average commissions per trade. We also consider client account and client asset metrics, although we believe they are generally of less significance to our results of operations for any particular period than our metrics for asset-based and transaction-based revenues.\nAsset-Based Revenue Metrics\nWe calculate the return on our bank deposit account balances and our interest-earning assets using a measure we refer to as net interest margin. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of bank deposit account fees and net interest revenue by average spread-based assets. Spread-based assets consist of average bank deposit account balances and average interest-earning assets, which include client margin balances, segregated cash, deposits paid on securities borrowing and other cash and interest-earning investment balances. The following table sets forth net interest margin and average spread-based assets (dollars in millions):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues increased 10% to $6.02 billion during fiscal year 2019. We expect net revenues to decrease to between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion during fiscal year 2020, primarily due to our reduction in trade commission pricing during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, decreases in the target range for the federal funds rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and further potential decreases in the interest rate environment during fiscal year 2020. Effective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, exchange traded funds (ETF) (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). This reduction in trade commission pricing is expected to decrease net revenues by approximately $880 million to $960 million per fiscal year.\nCommissions and transaction fees increased 2% to $2.00 billion, primarily due to increased client trading activity, partially offset by lower average commissions per trade. Average client trades per day increased 6% to 862,158 for fiscal year 2019 compared to 811,110 for fiscal year 2018. Order routing revenue increased 7% to $492 million due to higher trading volumes. Average commissions per trade decreased to $7.02 from $7.45, primarily due to a higher percentage of our clients' trades receiving reduced commission rates as a result of continued price competition in the industry and lower average contracts per trade on options and futures trades.\nAsset-based revenues increased 14% to $3.84 billion for fiscal year 2019, primarily due to an increase of 33 basis points in net interest margin to 2.21%. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the Federal Open Market Committee increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points during fiscal year 2018 and by 25 basis points during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease of 50 basis points during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. The increase in net interest margin was also due to the impact of higher average client margin balances, which earn a larger net interest spread.\nBank deposit account fees increased 11% to $1.72 billion, primarily due to an increase of 20 basis points in the average yield earned on the bank deposit account balances, partially offset by a 3% decrease in average client bank deposit account balances. The average yield earned on bank deposit account balances increased primarily due to floating-rate investment balances within the Insured Deposit Account (\"IDA\") portfolio benefiting from the federal funds net rate increases during fiscal years 2018 and 2019, as described above, investments being reinvested at higher rates upon maturity and the favorable impact from the removal of the FDIC surcharge in October 2018. These increases were partially offset by higher interest rates paid to clients. The decrease in average client bank deposit account balances is primarily due to clients investing in other asset classes.\nNet interest revenue increased 21% to $1.53 billion, primarily due to increases in the average yields earned on client margin balances, segregated cash and other cash and interest-earning investments, a 4% increase in average client margin balances and a $26 million increase in net interest revenue from our securities borrowing/lending program. These increases were partially offset by a 19% decrease in average segregated cash balances. The increases in the average yields earned are primarily due to the federal funds net rate increases during fiscal years 2018 and 2019, as described above.\nInvestment product fees increased 5% to $586 million, primarily due to a net increase in average fee-based investment balances and an increase in average yields earned on certain investment products. The favorable impact from the increase in balances was partially offset by decreased balances in higher yielding investment products. The average yield earned on fee-based investment balances decreased by 1 basis point, as average balance increases were primarily in investment products which earn lower yields.\nOther revenues increased 58% to $178 million, primarily due to a $49 million increase in revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09) on October 1, 2018 and increased fees from processing corporate securities reorganizations.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses decreased 13% to $3.02 billion during fiscal year 2019, primarily due to $445 million of acquisition-related expenses incurred during the prior fiscal year. We expect total operating expenses to decrease to between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion for fiscal year 2020.\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense decreased 15% to $1.32 billion, primarily due to $235 million of severance and other employment benefits related to the Scottrade integration during the prior fiscal year, partially offset by an increase to expense of $10 million during fiscal year 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09) on October 1, 2018. The average number of full-time equivalent employees decreased to 9,420 for fiscal year 2019 compared to 9,728 for fiscal year 2018.\nClearing and execution costs increased 11% to $209 million, primarily due to an increase to expense of $21 million as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.\nCommunications expense decreased 13% to $155 million, primarily due to decreased costs for quotes and market information and telecommunications resulting from the integration of the Scottrade business during the prior fiscal year.\nOccupancy and equipment costs decreased 12% to $267 million, primarily due to decreased costs resulting from the integration of the Scottrade business during the prior fiscal year, including decreased expenses attributed to software maintenance, facilities expenses related to leased facilities and equipment repairs and maintenance.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets decreased 11% to $125 million, primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized. We expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to decrease to between $115 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2020.\nProfessional services expense decreased 3% to $294 million, primarily due to increased usage of consulting and contract services associated with the Scottrade integration during the prior fiscal year.\nAdvertising expense increased 2% to $298 million. We expect advertising expense to range from $250 million to $300 million for fiscal year 2020. We generally adjust our level of advertise spending in relation to stock market activity and other market conditions in an effort to maximize new client relationships and net new assets.\nOther operating expenses decreased 44% to $197 million, primarily due to increased costs during the prior fiscal year, consisting of $172 million of costs related to the Scottrade integration, mainly comprised of contract terminations, and an increase in the provision for bad debt of $56 million related to market volatility during the prior fiscal year. These increased costs during the prior fiscal year were partially offset by increased costs during fiscal year 2019, including $28 million as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, a $20 million net legal settlement and costs related to the closure of 80 retail branch locations.\nOther Expense (Income) and Income Taxes\nInterest on borrowings increased 45% to $144 million, primarily due to a 30% increase in average debt outstanding and an increase of 42 basis points in the average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings. On October 30, 2018, we issued $600 million of variable-rate Senior Notes due November 1, 2021 and $400 million of 3.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2024. We also issued $500 million of 2.75% Senior Notes due on October 1, 2029 on August 13, 2019. For more information regarding these debt issuances, see \"Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings\" later in this section.\nGain on business-related divestiture consists of a gain from the sale of TDATC's retirement plan custody and trust assets.\nOther non-operating income for fiscal year 2019 primarily consists of a $14 million favorable legal settlement, partially offset by a prepayment premium on long-term debt.\nOur effective income tax rate was 24.6% for fiscal year 2019, compared to 21.9% for fiscal year 2018. The effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 included $16 million of favorable adjustments related to state income tax matters and a $4 million income tax benefit resulting from the vesting of equity-based compensation. These items had a favorable impact on our earnings for fiscal year 2019 of approximately $0.04 per share. The effective income tax rate for the prior fiscal year included a net favorable adjustment of $71 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred income tax balances as it pertains to the Act, a $5 million income tax benefit resulting from the change in accounting for income taxes related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09, $12 million of favorable resolutions of state income tax matters and a $30 million favorable benefit resulting from accelerating certain deductions, including acquisition-related exit costs, to leverage higher 2017 pre-enactment tax rates. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a $9 million unfavorable remeasurement of uncertain tax positions related to certain federal incentives. These items had a net favorable impact on the Company's earnings for fiscal\nyear 2018 of approximately $0.19 per share. We estimate our effective income tax rate to be between 24% and 26% for fiscal year 2020, excluding the effect of any adjustments related to remeasurement or resolution of uncertain tax positions and federal incentives. However, we expect to experience some volatility in our quarterly and annual effective income tax rate because current accounting rules for uncertain tax positions require that any change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior tax year be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which the change occurs. We also anticipate the potential for increased volatility in our future quarterly effective income tax rate from the accounting for income taxes related to equity-based compensation, which requires the income tax effects of exercised or vested stock-based awards to be treated as discrete items in the period in which they occur.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017\nNet Revenues\nCommissions and transaction fees increased 42% to $1.97 billion, primarily due to the addition of approximately 3.5 million funded accounts as a result of the Scottrade acquisition on September 18, 2017, partially offset by lower average commissions per trade for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. Average client trades per day increased 59% to 811,110 for fiscal year 2018 compared to 510,710 for fiscal year 2017. Order routing revenue increased 43% to $458 million due to higher trading volumes. Average commissions per trade decreased to $7.45 from $8.33, primarily due to our reduction in client pricing for online equity and option trades during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a higher percentage of equity trades, which earn somewhat lower average commissions per trade than option and futures trades. Effective March 6, 2017, we reduced our online equity and ETF trade commissions from $9.99 to $6.95 per trade and also lowered options pricing to $6.95 per trade (plus $0.75 per contract).\nAsset-based revenues increased 52% to $3.37 billion for fiscal year 2018, primarily due to increases in average spread-based assets, net interest margin earned on spread-based assets and average market fee-based investment balances. The growth in average spread-based and market fee-based investment balances is primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition and our success in attracting net new client assets. Net interest margin increased 39 basis points to 1.88% during fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Federal Open Market Committee increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points (to between 1.00% and 1.25%) during fiscal year 2017 and by 100 basis points (to between 2.00% to 2.25%) during fiscal year 2018. The increase in net interest margin was also due to the impact of higher average client margin balances, which earn a larger net interest spread.\nBank deposit account fees increased 39% to $1.54 billion, primarily due to a 24% increase in average bank deposit account balances and an increase of 14 basis points in the average yield earned on the bank deposit account assets. The growth in the average bank deposit account balances is primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition and our success in attracting net new client assets. The average yield earned on bank deposit account assets increased primarily due to floating-rate investment balances within the IDA portfolio benefiting from the federal funds rate increases during fiscal years 2017 and 2018, as described above, partially offset by higher interest rates paid to clients.\nNet interest revenue increased 84% to $1.27 billion due to a 58% increase in average client margin balances, primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition, increases in the average yields earned on client margin balances, segregated cash and other cash and interest-earning investments as a result of the federal funds rate increases during fiscal years 2017 and 2018, as described above, and an $83 million increase in net interest revenue from our securities borrowing/lending program.\nInvestment product fees increased 32% to $557 million, primarily due to a 37% increase in average market fee-based investment balances. The increase in market fee-based investment balances is primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition and growth in our advised solutions products.\nOther revenues increased 57% to $113 million, primarily due to favorable fair market value adjustments on investments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries and increases in fees related to processing corporate securities reorganizations, proxy services and other fee revenue associated with additional accounts and transaction processing volumes resulting from the Scottrade acquisition.\nOperating Expenses\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense increased 62% to $1.56 billion, primarily due to $235 million of severance and other employment benefits related to the Scottrade integration, an increase in average headcount related to the Scottrade acquisition and our strategic growth initiatives, and annual merit increases. The average number of full-time equivalent employees increased to 9,728 for fiscal year 2018 compared to 6,661 for fiscal year 2017.\nClearing and execution costs increased 27% to $189 million, primarily due to increased costs associated with additional accounts and transaction processing volumes resulting from the Scottrade acquisition.\nCommunications expense increased 37% to $179 million, primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition, resulting in increased costs for quotes and market information associated with additional accounts and transaction processing volumes and costs for telecommunications.\nOccupancy and equipment costs increased 67% to $302 million, primarily due to additional costs associated with the Scottrade business, including increased expenses related to leased facilities, software licensing and software maintenance.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 39% to $142 million, primarily due to depreciation on assets recorded in the Scottrade acquisition, placing our new Southlake, Texas operations center in service during December 2017, and technology infrastructure upgrades.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets increased 78% to $141 million, primarily due to amortization of the client relationships intangible asset recorded in the Scottrade acquisition.\nProfessional services expense increased 17% to $303 million, primarily due to higher usage of consulting and contract services related to operational and technology-related initiatives and in connection with the Scottrade integration, partially offset by lower costs associated with legal matters.\nAdvertising expense increased 15% to $293 million, primarily due to the Scottrade acquisition and due to increased advertising during professional and collegiate sporting events.\nOther operating expenses increased 280% to $350 million, primarily due to $172 million of costs related to the Scottrade integration, mainly comprised of contract terminations, a net increase in the provision for bad debt of $56 million related to market volatility during fiscal year 2018 and additional expenses associated with the Scottrade business.\nOther Expense and Income Taxes\nInterest on borrowings increased 39% to $99 million, primarily due to a 31% increase in average debt outstanding and an increase of 19 basis points in the average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings. On April 27, 2017, we issued $800 million of 3.300% Senior Notes due April 1, 2027 to finance a portion of the cash consideration paid in connection with the Scottrade acquisition.\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.9% for fiscal year 2018, compared to 37.4% for fiscal year 2017. The effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 included an estimated net favorable adjustment of $71 million related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred income tax balances as it pertains to the Act, a $5 million income tax benefit resulting from the change in accounting for income taxes related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09, $12 million of favorable resolutions of state income tax matters and a $30 million favorable benefit resulting from accelerating certain deductions, including acquisition-related exit costs, to leverage higher 2017 pre-enactment tax rates. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a $9 million unfavorable remeasurement of uncertain tax positions related to certain federal incentives. These items had a net favorable impact on our earnings for fiscal year 2018 of approximately $0.19 per share. The Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of business strategies to meet operational needs and to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and modeled stressed conditions. Our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable\nto meet current and future cash flow needs. Management of our liquidity is accomplished by (1) daily monitoring of our cash flow needs at TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (the \"Parent\") and its operating subsidiaries, and (2) performing periodic liquidity stress testing related to market and company-specific liquidity stress events in order to identify and plan for liquidity risk exposures.\nWe have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from subsidiary operations and from short-term borrowings. We have also issued common stock and long-term debt to finance mergers and acquisitions and for other corporate purposes. Our liquidity needs during fiscal year 2019 were financed primarily from our subsidiaries' earnings, cash on hand and borrowings. We plan to finance both our ordinary capital and liquidity needs in fiscal year 2020 primarily from our subsidiaries' earnings, cash on hand and borrowings.\nParent Company\nThe Parent conducts substantially all of its business through its operating subsidiaries, principally its broker-dealer and futures commission merchant (\"FCM\")/forex dealer member (\"FDM\") subsidiaries. Dividends from our subsidiaries are an important source of liquidity for the Parent. Some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\"), the National Futures Association (\"NFA\") and other regulators relating to liquidity, capital standards and the use of client funds and securities, which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the Parent.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we returned $1.67 billion, or approximately 72% of our non-GAAP net income (net income excluding amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses) to our stockholders through cash dividends and stock repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we plan to (1) return at least 90% of our non-GAAP net income to our stockholders through cash dividends and stock repurchases, (2) pay a quarterly cash dividend of at least $0.31 per share, and (3) repurchase a minimum of 15 million shares of our common stock. For more information about our dividends and stock repurchases, see \"Cash Dividends\" and \"Stock Repurchase Programs\" later in this section.\nOn October 30, 2018, we sold, through a public offering, $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured variable-rate senior notes due November 1, 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\") and $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.750% senior notes due April 1, 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"). We are using the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes for general corporate purposes and to augment liquidity. On August 13, 2019, we sold, through a public offering, $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 2.750% senior notes due October 1, 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"). We utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount and prepayment premium under our 5.600% senior notes (the \"2019 Notes\"), which were scheduled to mature on December 1, 2019. For additional details, see Note 11 Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Parent may make loans of cash or securities under committed and/or uncommitted lines of credit with each of its primary broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries in order to provide liquidity. Liquidity could be used to fund increases in our subsidiaries' deposit requirements with clearinghouses, and to provide operating liquidity for client trading and investing activity in the normal course of business and during times of market volatility. Committed facilities of $1.25 billion and uncommitted facilities of $600 million under the Parent's intercompany credit agreements were available to its primary broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries as of September 30, 2019. For more information about these credit agreements, see \"Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings - Intercompany Credit Agreements\" later in this section.\nBroker-dealer and Futures Commission Merchant/Forex Dealer Member Subsidiaries\nOur broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure their liquidity and general financial soundness. Under the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the \"Exchange Act\"), our broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under SEC Rule 15c3-1. For our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, the minimum net capital level is determined by a calculation described in SEC Rule 15c3-1 that is primarily based on the broker-dealer's \"aggregate debits,\" which primarily consist of client margin balances at\nthe clearing broker-dealer. Since our aggregate debits may fluctuate significantly, our minimum net capital requirements may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. The Parent may make cash capital contributions to our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, if necessary, to meet minimum net capital requirements.\nEach of our broker-dealer subsidiaries may not repay any subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than (1) 5% of aggregate debit balances or (2) 120% of its minimum dollar requirement. TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC (\"TDAFF\"), our FCM and FDM subsidiary, must provide notice to the CFTC if its adjusted net capital amounts to less than (1) 110% of its risk-based capital requirement under CFTC Regulation 1.17, (2) 150% of its $1.0 million minimum dollar requirement, or (3) 110% of $20.0 million plus 5% of all liabilities owed to forex clients in excess of $10.0 million. These broker-dealer, FCM and FDM net capital thresholds, which are specified in Rule 17a-11 under the Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations 1.12 and 5.6, are typically referred to as \"early warning\" net capital thresholds.\nThe following tables summarize our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries' net capital and adjusted net capital, respectively, as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Early Warning\nThreshold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Capital in\nExcess of\nEarly Warning\nThreshold\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted Net Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Early Warning\nThreshold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted Net Capital in\nExcess of\nEarly Warning\nThreshold\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (\"TDAC\"), engages in activities such as settling client securities transactions with clearinghouses, extending credit to clients through margin lending, securities lending and borrowing transactions and processing client cash sweep transactions to and from bank deposit accounts and money market mutual funds. These types of broker-dealer activities require active daily liquidity management.\nMost of TDAC's assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients, receivables from clients and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. Cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients may be held in cash, reverse repurchase agreements (collateralized by U.S. government debt securities), U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and other qualified securities. Receivables from clients consist of margin loans, which are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily arise from current open transactions, which usually settle or can be settled within a few business days.\nTDAC is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\") and the Options Clearing Corporation (\"OCC\"), which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based on the nature and size of our clients' trading activity.\nThe following table sets forth TDAC's cash and investments deposited with clearing organizations for the clearing of client equity and option trades (dollars in millions):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity needs for TDAC relating to client trading and margin borrowing are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and through lending and pledging of client margin securities. Cash balances in client brokerage accounts not used for client trading and margin borrowing activity are not generally available for other\nliquidity purposes and must be segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients under Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act.\nCash balances in client brokerage accounts are summarized in the following table (dollars in billions):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and investments segregated in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of clients under SEC Rule 15c3-3 are summarized in the following table (dollars in billions):\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor general liquidity needs, TDAC currently maintains two senior unsecured committed revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion. TDAC also utilizes secured uncommitted lines of credit for short-term liquidity needs. These facilities are described under \"Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings\" later in this section.\nIn addition, we have established intercompany credit agreements under which the broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries may borrow from the Parent. The Parent's intercompany credit agreements with TDAC provides for a committed revolving loan facility of $1.20 billion and an uncommitted revolving loan facility of $300 million. The intercompany credit agreements are described under \"Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings - Intercompany Credit Agreements\" later in this section.\nLiquid Assets\nLiquid assets is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be an important measure of our liquidity. We include the excess capital of our regulated subsidiaries in the calculation of liquid assets, rather than simply including the regulated subsidiaries' cash and cash equivalents, because capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Excess capital, as defined below, is generally available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity, rather than as a substitute for GAAP cash and cash equivalents.\nLiquid assets may be utilized for general corporate purposes and is defined as the sum of (1) corporate cash and cash equivalents, (2) corporate investments, less securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and (3) our regulated subsidiaries' net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management. Corporate cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents from our investment advisory subsidiaries. Liquid assets is based on more conservative measures of net capital than regulatory requirements because we generally manage to higher levels of net capital at our regulated subsidiaries than the regulatory thresholds require.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to liquid assets (dollars in millions):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess regulatory net capital over management targets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquid assets (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in liquid assets are summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquid assets as of September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net decrease in cash collateral pledged to interest rate swap counterparties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other changes in working capital and regulatory net capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other investing activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in net capital related to daily futures client cash sweep\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase of treasury stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income taxes paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment of cash dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal payment on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(199\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net payments on securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase of treasury stock for income tax withholding on stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment of prepayment premium on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquid assets as of September 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See \"Financial Performance Metrics\" earlier in this section for a description of EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings\nThe following is a summary of our long-term debt and other borrowings.

To hedge a vast majority of this exposure, we entered into fixed-for-variable interest rate swaps on each of the 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes (together, the \"Hedged Senior Notes\"). Each fixed-for-variable interest rate swap has a notional amount and a maturity date matching the aggregate principal amount and maturity date, respectively, for each of the respective Hedged Senior Notes. During September 2019, we paid in full the outstanding principal under the 2019 Notes and the interest rate swap on the 2019 Notes was terminated.\nThe interest rate swaps effectively change the fixed-rate interest on the Hedged Senior Notes to variable-rate interest. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments based on the same rates applicable to the Hedged Senior Notes, and make quarterly variable-rate interest payments based on three-month LIBOR plus (1) 0.9486% for the swap on the 2022 Notes, (2) 1.1022% for the swap on the 2025 Notes, (3) 1.0340% for the swap on the 2027 Notes and (4) 1.2000% for the swap on the 2029 Notes. As of September 30, 2019, the weighted average effective interest rate on the aggregate principal balance of the Senior Notes was 3.27%.\nLines of Credit - TDAC utilizes secured uncommitted lines of credit for short-term liquidity. Under these secured uncommitted lines, TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis from two unaffiliated banks and pledges client margin securities as collateral. Advances under the secured uncommitted lines are dependent on TDAC having acceptable collateral as determined by each secured uncommitted credit agreement. At September 30, 2019, the terms of the secured uncommitted credit agreements do not specify borrowing limits. The availability of TDAC's secured uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. There were no borrowings outstanding under the secured uncommitted lines of credit as of September 30, 2019.\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (repurchase agreements) - Under repurchase agreements, we receive cash from the counterparty and provide U.S. government debt securities as collateral. Our repurchase agreements generally mature between 30 and 90 days following the transaction date and are accounted for as secured borrowings. There were no borrowings outstanding under repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2019.\nTD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Senior Revolving Credit Facility - The Parent has access to a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million (the \"Parent Revolving Facility\"). The maturity date of the Parent Revolving Facility is April 21, 2022. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Parent Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2019.\nTD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. Senior Revolving Credit Facilities - TDAC has access to two senior unsecured committed revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion, consisting of a $600 million (the \"$600 Million Revolving Facility\") and an $850 million (the \"$850 Million Revolving Facility\") senior revolving facility. TDAC entered into the $850 Million Revolving Facility on May 16, 2019, replacing its prior $850 million senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility, which matured on the same date. The maturity dates of the $600 Million Revolving Facility and the $850 Million Revolving Facility are April 21, 2022 and May 14, 2020, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TDAC senior revolving facilities as of September 30, 2019.\nIntercompany Credit Agreements - The Parent has entered into credit agreements with each of its primary broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, under which the Parent may make loans of cash or securities under committed and/or uncommitted lines of credit. Key information about the committed and/or uncommitted lines of credit is summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrower Subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Committed Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Uncommitted Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Termination Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 11, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The Parent is permitted, but under no obligation, to make loans under uncommitted facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> There were no borrowings outstanding under the intercompany credit agreements as of September 30, 2019.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn November 20, 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30 million shares of our common stock. During fiscal year 2019, we repurchased approximately 19.8 million shares at a weighted average purchase price of $50.40 per share. From the inception of this stock repurchase authorization through September 30, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 28.4 million shares at a weighted average purchase price of $48.25 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 1.6 million shares remaining under the November 20, 2015 stock repurchase authorization.

Bank deposit account fees, generated from the IDA agreement and other sweep arrangements with non-affiliated third-party depository financial institutions, account for a significant percentage of our net revenues (29% of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019). These sweep arrangements enable our clients to invest in FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) deposit products without the need for the Company to establish the significant levels of capital that would be required to maintain our own bank charter.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period (Fiscal Years):\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023-24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes payable(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents scheduled principal payments, estimated interest payments and commitment fees pursuant to the Senior Notes, the interest rate swaps and the revolving credit facilities.

The forward-looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date on which they were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by the federal securities laws.\nGlossary of Terms\nIn discussing and analyzing our business, we utilize several metrics and other terms that are defined in the following Glossary of Terms. Italics indicate other defined terms that appear elsewhere in the Glossary. The term \"GAAP\" refers to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAsset-based revenues - Revenues consisting of (1) bank deposit account fees, (2) net interest revenue and (3) investment product fees. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and securities lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances.\nAverage client trades per day - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as daily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\").\nAverage commissions per trade - Total commissions and transaction fee revenues as reported on our consolidated financial statements, less order routing revenue, divided by total trades for the period. Commissions and transaction fee revenues primarily consist of trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities.\nBasis point - When referring to interest rates, one basis point represents one one-hundredth of one percent.\nBank deposit account fees - Revenues generated from a sweep program that is offered to eligible clients of the Company whereby clients' uninvested cash is swept to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts at affiliated and non-affiliated third-party financial institutions participating in the program.\nBeneficiary accounts - Brokerage accounts managed by a custodian, guardian, conservator or trustee on behalf of one or more beneficiaries. Examples include accounts maintained under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), guardianship, conservatorship and trust arrangements and pension or profit plan for small business accounts.\nBrokerage accounts - Accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for securities brokerage activities. The primary types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts, margin accounts, IRA accounts and beneficiary accounts. Futures accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to trade futures and/or options on futures. Forex accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to engage in foreign exchange trading.\nCash accounts - Brokerage accounts that do not have margin account approval.\nClient assets - The total value of cash and securities in brokerage accounts.\nClient cash and money market assets - The sum of all client cash balances, including client credit balances and client cash balances swept into bank deposit accounts or money market mutual funds.\nClient credit balances - Client cash held in brokerage accounts, excluding balances generated by client short sales on which no interest is paid. Interest paid on client credit balances is a reduction of net interest revenue. Client credit balances are included in \"payable to clients\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nClient margin balances - The total amount of cash loaned to clients in margin accounts. Such loans are secured by client assets. Interest earned on client margin balances is a component of net interest revenue. Client margin balances are included in \"receivable from clients, net\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nCommissions and transaction fees - Revenues earned on trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities. Revenues earned on trading commissions includes client trades in common and preferred stock, ETFs, exchange-traded notes, closed-end funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and fixed income securities.\nConsolidated duration - The weighted average remaining years until maturity of our spread-based assets. For purposes of this calculation, floating rate balances are treated as having a one-month duration. Consolidated duration is used in analyzing our aggregate interest rate sensitivity.\nDaily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\") - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as average client trades per day.\nEBITDA - EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure. We consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under our senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nFee-based investment balances - Client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and our programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios on which we earn fee revenues. Fee revenues earned on these balances are included in \"investment product fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nForex accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for foreign exchange trading. Each forex account must be associated with a brokerage account. Forex accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nFunded accounts - All open client accounts with a total liquidation value greater than zero.\nFutures accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for trading in futures and/or options on futures. Each futures account must be associated with a brokerage account. Futures accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nInsured Deposit Account - We are party to an Insured Deposit Account (\"IDA\") agreement with TD Bank USA, N.A. (\"TD Bank USA\"), TD Bank, N.A. and The Toronto-Dominion Bank (\"TD\"). Under the IDA agreement, TD Bank USA and TD Bank, N.A. (together, the \"TD Depository Institutions\") make available to our clients FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts as either designated sweep vehicles or as non-sweep deposit accounts. We provide marketing, recordkeeping and support services for the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts. In exchange for providing these services, the TD Depository\nInstitutions pay us an aggregate marketing fee based on the weighted average yield earned on the client IDA assets, less the actual interest paid to clients, a servicing fee to the TD Depository Institutions and the cost of FDIC insurance premiums. Fee revenues earned under this agreement are included in \"bank deposit account fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest-earning assets - Consist of client margin balances, segregated cash, deposits paid on securities borrowing and other cash and interest-earning investment balances.\nInterest rate-sensitive assets - Consist of spread-based assets and client cash invested in money market mutual funds.\nInvestment product fees - Revenues earned on fee-based investment balances. Investment product fees consists of fees earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and through investment programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios. Investment product fees also includes fees earned on client assets managed by independent registered investment advisors utilizing our trading and investing platforms.\nIRA accounts (Individual Retirement Arrangements) - A personal trust account for the exclusive benefit of a U.S. individual (or his or her beneficiaries) that provides tax advantages in accumulating funds to save for retirement or other qualified purposes. These accounts are subject to numerous restrictions on additions to and withdrawals from the account, as well as prohibitions against certain investments or transactions conducted within the account. We offer traditional, Roth, Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA accounts.\nLiquid assets - Liquid assets is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be an important measure of our liquidity. Liquid assets may be utilized for general corporate purposes and is defined as the sum of (1) corporate cash and cash equivalents, (2) corporate investments, less securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and (3) our regulated subsidiaries' net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management. Corporate cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents from our investment advisory subsidiaries. Liquid assets represents available capital, including any capital from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of established management operational targets. We include the excess capital of our regulated subsidiaries in the calculation of liquid assets, rather than simply including regulated subsidiaries' cash and cash equivalents, because capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management is generally available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Liquid assets is based on more conservative measures of net capital than regulatory requirements because we generally manage to higher levels of net capital at our regulated subsidiaries than the regulatory thresholds require. Liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity, rather than as a substitute for GAAP cash and cash equivalents.\nLiquidation value - The net value of a client's account holdings as of the close of a regular trading session. Liquidation value includes client cash and the value of long security positions, less margin balances and the cost to buy back short security positions. It also includes the value of open futures, foreign exchange and options positions.\nMargin accounts - Brokerage accounts in which clients may borrow from us to buy securities or for any other purpose, subject to regulatory and Company-imposed limitations.\nNet interest margin (\"NIM\") - A measure of the net yield on our average spread-based assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of bank deposit account fees and net interest revenue by average spread-based assets.\nNet interest revenue - Net interest revenue is interest revenues less brokerage interest expense. Interest revenues are generated by charges to clients on margin balances maintained in margin accounts, the investment of cash from operations and segregated cash and interest earned on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense consists of amounts paid or payable to clients based on credit balances maintained in brokerage accounts and interest incurred on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense does not include interest on our non-brokerage borrowings.\nNet new assets - Consists of total client asset inflows, less total client asset outflows, excluding activity from business combinations. Client asset inflows include interest and dividend payments and exclude changes in client\nassets due to market fluctuations. Net new assets are measured based on the market value of the assets as of the date of the inflows and outflows.\nNet new asset growth rate (annualized) - Annualized net new assets as a percentage of client assets as of the beginning of the period.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS - Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") are non-GAAP financial measures. We define non-GAAP net income as net income adjusted to remove the after-tax effect of amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and may be useful in evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating a meaningful comparison of our results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of our underlying business performance. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded as these costs are not representative of the costs of running our on-going business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS.\nOrder routing revenue - Revenues generated from payments and/or rebates received from market centers. Order routing revenue is a component of transaction-based revenues.\nSecurities borrowing - We borrow securities temporarily from other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed, and generally earn interest revenue on the cash deposited with the counterparty. We also incur interest expense for borrowing certain securities.\nSecurities lending - We loan securities temporarily to other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We receive cash as collateral for the securities loaned, and generally incur interest expense on the cash deposited with us. We also earn revenue for lending certain securities.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) - We sell securities to counterparties with an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same securities at a stated price plus interest on a specified date. We utilize repurchase agreements to finance our short-term liquidity and capital needs. Under these financing transactions, we receive cash from counterparties and provide U.S. Treasury securities as collateral.\nSegregated cash - Client cash and investments segregated in compliance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Customer Protection Rule) and other regulations. Interest earned on segregated cash is a component of net interest revenue.\nSpread-based assets - Client and brokerage-related asset balances, consisting of bank deposit account balances and interest-earning assets. Spread-based assets is used in the calculation of our net interest margin and our consolidated duration.\nTotal trades - Revenue-generating client securities trades, which are executed by our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries. Total trades are a significant source of our revenues. Such trades include, but are not limited to, trades in equities, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and debt instruments. Trades generate revenue from commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction fees and/or order routing revenue.\nTrading days - Days in which the U.S. equity markets are open for a full trading session. Reduced exchange trading sessions are treated as half trading days.\nTransaction-based revenues - Revenues generated from client trade execution, consisting primarily of commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction clearing fees and order routing revenue.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nWe provide securities brokerage and clearing services to our clients through our introducing and clearing broker-dealer subsidiaries. We also provide futures and foreign exchange trade execution services to our clients through our futures commission merchant (\"FCM\") and forex dealer member (\"FDM\") subsidiary. Substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services. Our primary focus is\nserving retail investors and traders and independent registered investment advisors by providing services with straightforward, affordable pricing.\nOur largest sources of revenues are asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances. The primary factors driving our transaction-based revenues are total client trades and average commissions per trade. Effective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, exchange traded funds (ETF) (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). For information regarding the expected impact of these price reductions to our net revenues, see \"Results of Operations\" later in this section. We also receive order routing revenue, which results from arrangements we have with many market centers to receive cash payments and/or rebates in exchange for routing orders to these firms for execution. Order routing revenue is included in commissions and transaction fees on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits. Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, group insurance, contributions to benefit programs, recruitment, severance and other related employee costs.\nClearing and execution costs include incremental third-party expenses that tend to fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in client accounts or trades. Examples of expenses included in this category are outsourced clearing services, statement and confirmation processing and postage costs and clearing expenses paid to the National Securities Clearing Corporation, option exchanges and other market centers. Communications expense includes telecommunications, other postage, news and quote costs. Occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces, software licensing and maintenance costs and maintenance expenses on computer hardware and other equipment. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of amounts allocated to the value of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions.\nProfessional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal, accounting, technology, regulatory, marketing and general management issues. Advertising costs include production and placement of advertisements in various media, including online, television, print and email, as well as client promotion and development costs. Advertising expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Other operating expenses include provision for bad debt losses, fraud and error losses, gains or losses on disposal of property, insurance expenses, travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. During fiscal year 2018, other operating expenses also included costs incurred related to the integration of Scottrade.\nInterest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Gain on business-related divestiture represents the gain realized on the sale of TD Ameritrade Trust Company's (\"TDATC\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retirement plan custody and trust assets on June 28, 2019. Loss on sale of investments represents losses realized on corporate (non broker-dealer) investments.\nAcquisition of Scottrade\nOn September 18, 2017, we completed our acquisition of the brokerage business of Scottrade. The transaction combined highly complementary franchises and added significant scale to our retail business with the addition of approximately 3.5 million funded client accounts, extended our leadership in trading, and expanded the size of our branch network.\nFor additional information regarding this acquisition, see Note 2 - Business Acquisition under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results. Note 1, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management's judgments and estimates and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position.\nValuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets\nWe test goodwill and our indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset for impairment on at least an annual basis, or whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the Company as a whole. The estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting unit and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit. No impairment charges have resulted from our goodwill impairment tests.\nTo determine if the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we first assess certain qualitative factors. Based on this assessment, if it is determined that more likely than not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. No impairment charges have resulted from the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests.\nWe review our finite-lived acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period to determine if events or trends warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We have had no events or trends that have warranted a material revision to the originally estimated useful lives.\nEstimates of effective income tax rates, uncertain tax positions, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances\nWe estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current income tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. We must evaluate the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized. To the extent we determine that realization is not \"more likely than not,\" we establish a valuation allowance. Establishing or increasing a valuation allowance results in a corresponding increase to income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance can be reduced or is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, reducing income tax expense.\nWe must make significant judgments to calculate our provision for income taxes, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. We must also exercise judgment in determining the need for, and amount of, any accruals for uncertain tax positions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations to many types of transactions is subject to varying interpretations, amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements could be significantly changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing authorities.\nAccruals for contingent liabilities\nAccruals for contingent liabilities, such as legal and regulatory claims and proceedings, reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter. In making such estimates, we consider many factors, including the progress of the matter, prior experience and the experience of others in similar matters, available defenses, insurance coverage, indemnification provisions and the advice of legal counsel and other experts. In many matters, such as those in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter\nis close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Because matters may be resolved over long periods of time, accruals are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount accrued.\nResults of Operations\nConditions in the U.S. equity markets significantly impact the volume of our clients' trading activity. There is a relationship between the volume of our clients' trading activity and our results of operations. We cannot predict future trading volumes in the U.S. equity markets. If client trading activity increases, we generally expect that it would have a positive impact on our results of operations. If client trading activity declines, we generally expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in average client balances, especially bank deposit account, margin, credit and fee-based investment balances, may significantly impact our results of operations. Changes in interest rates also significantly impact our results of operations. We seek to mitigate interest rate risk by aligning the average duration of our interest-earning assets with that of our interest-bearing liabilities. We cannot predict the direction of interest rates or the levels of client balances. If interest rates rise, we generally expect to earn a larger net interest spread. Conversely, a falling interest rate environment generally would result in us earning a smaller net interest spread.\nEffective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, ETFs (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). The expected impact of these price reductions on our net revenues for fiscal year 2020 is discussed later in this section.\nFinancial Performance Metrics\nNet income, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) are key metrics we use in evaluating our financial performance. Net income and diluted earnings per share are GAAP financial measures and EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under the TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nThe following table sets forth net income in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated, and provides reconciliations to EBITDA (dollars in millions):\n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018\nOur net income increased 50% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture, partially offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate and interest on borrowings. The effective income tax rate was lower in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") on December 22, 2017.\nOur EBITDA increased 47% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture.\nOur diluted earnings per share increased 53% to $3.96 for fiscal year 2019 compared to $2.59 for fiscal year 2018, due to higher net income and a 2% decrease in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. Details regarding our fiscal year 2020 expectations for net revenues and expenses are presented later in this discussion.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017\nOur net income increased 69% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to an increase in net revenues and a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the enactment of the Act on December 22, 2017. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and interest on borrowings, and an $11 million loss on sale of investments during fiscal year 2018.

Italics indicate other defined terms that appear elsewhere in the Glossary. The term \"GAAP\" refers to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAsset-based revenues - Revenues consisting of (1) bank deposit account fees, (2) net interest revenue and (3) investment product fees. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and securities lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances.\nAverage client trades per day - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as daily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\").\nAverage commissions per trade - Total commissions and transaction fee revenues as reported on our consolidated financial statements, less order routing revenue, divided by total trades for the period. Commissions and transaction fee revenues primarily consist of trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities.\nBasis point - When referring to interest rates, one basis point represents one one-hundredth of one percent.\nBank deposit account fees - Revenues generated from a sweep program that is offered to eligible clients of the Company whereby clients' uninvested cash is swept to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts at affiliated and non-affiliated third-party financial institutions participating in the program.\nBeneficiary accounts - Brokerage accounts managed by a custodian, guardian, conservator or trustee on behalf of one or more beneficiaries. Examples include accounts maintained under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), guardianship, conservatorship and trust arrangements and pension or profit plan for small business accounts.\nBrokerage accounts - Accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for securities brokerage activities. The primary types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts, margin accounts, IRA accounts and beneficiary accounts. Futures accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to trade futures and/or options on futures. Forex accounts are sub-accounts associated with a brokerage account for clients who want to engage in foreign exchange trading.\nCash accounts - Brokerage accounts that do not have margin account approval.\nClient assets - The total value of cash and securities in brokerage accounts.\nClient cash and money market assets - The sum of all client cash balances, including client credit balances and client cash balances swept into bank deposit accounts or money market mutual funds.\nClient credit balances - Client cash held in brokerage accounts, excluding balances generated by client short sales on which no interest is paid. Interest paid on client credit balances is a reduction of net interest revenue. Client credit balances are included in \"payable to clients\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nClient margin balances - The total amount of cash loaned to clients in margin accounts. Such loans are secured by client assets. Interest earned on client margin balances is a component of net interest revenue. Client margin balances are included in \"receivable from clients, net\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nCommissions and transaction fees - Revenues earned on trading commissions, order routing revenue and markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed-income securities. Revenues earned on trading commissions includes client trades in common and preferred stock, ETFs, exchange-traded notes, closed-end funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and fixed income securities.\nConsolidated duration - The weighted average remaining years until maturity of our spread-based assets. For purposes of this calculation, floating rate balances are treated as having a one-month duration. Consolidated duration is used in analyzing our aggregate interest rate sensitivity.\nDaily average revenue trades (\"DARTs\") - Total trades divided by the number of trading days in the period. This metric is also known as average client trades per day.\nEBITDA - EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure. We consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under our senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nFee-based investment balances - Client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and our programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios on which we earn fee revenues. Fee revenues earned on these balances are included in \"investment product fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nForex accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for foreign exchange trading. Each forex account must be associated with a brokerage account. Forex accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nFunded accounts - All open client accounts with a total liquidation value greater than zero.\nFutures accounts - Sub-accounts maintained by us on behalf of clients for trading in futures and/or options on futures. Each futures account must be associated with a brokerage account. Futures accounts are not counted separately for purposes of our client account metrics.\nInsured Deposit Account - We are party to an Insured Deposit Account (\"IDA\") agreement with TD Bank USA, N.A. (\"TD Bank USA\"), TD Bank, N.A. and The Toronto-Dominion Bank (\"TD\"). Under the IDA agreement, TD Bank USA and TD Bank, N.A. (together, the \"TD Depository Institutions\") make available to our clients FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts as either designated sweep vehicles or as non-sweep deposit accounts. We provide marketing, recordkeeping and support services for the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts. In exchange for providing these services, the TD Depository\nInstitutions pay us an aggregate marketing fee based on the weighted average yield earned on the client IDA assets, less the actual interest paid to clients, a servicing fee to the TD Depository Institutions and the cost of FDIC insurance premiums. Fee revenues earned under this agreement are included in \"bank deposit account fees\" on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest-earning assets - Consist of client margin balances, segregated cash, deposits paid on securities borrowing and other cash and interest-earning investment balances.\nInterest rate-sensitive assets - Consist of spread-based assets and client cash invested in money market mutual funds.\nInvestment product fees - Revenues earned on fee-based investment balances. Investment product fees consists of fees earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds, other mutual funds and through investment programs such as AdvisorDirect,\u00ae Essential Portfolios, Selective Portfolios and Personalized Portfolios. Investment product fees also includes fees earned on client assets managed by independent registered investment advisors utilizing our trading and investing platforms.\nIRA accounts (Individual Retirement Arrangements) - A personal trust account for the exclusive benefit of a U.S. individual (or his or her beneficiaries) that provides tax advantages in accumulating funds to save for retirement or other qualified purposes. These accounts are subject to numerous restrictions on additions to and withdrawals from the account, as well as prohibitions against certain investments or transactions conducted within the account. We offer traditional, Roth, Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA accounts.\nLiquid assets - Liquid assets is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be an important measure of our liquidity. Liquid assets may be utilized for general corporate purposes and is defined as the sum of (1) corporate cash and cash equivalents, (2) corporate investments, less securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and (3) our regulated subsidiaries' net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management. Corporate cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents from our investment advisory subsidiaries. Liquid assets represents available capital, including any capital from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of established management operational targets. We include the excess capital of our regulated subsidiaries in the calculation of liquid assets, rather than simply including regulated subsidiaries' cash and cash equivalents, because capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management is generally available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Liquid assets is based on more conservative measures of net capital than regulatory requirements because we generally manage to higher levels of net capital at our regulated subsidiaries than the regulatory thresholds require. Liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity, rather than as a substitute for GAAP cash and cash equivalents.\nLiquidation value - The net value of a client's account holdings as of the close of a regular trading session. Liquidation value includes client cash and the value of long security positions, less margin balances and the cost to buy back short security positions. It also includes the value of open futures, foreign exchange and options positions.\nMargin accounts - Brokerage accounts in which clients may borrow from us to buy securities or for any other purpose, subject to regulatory and Company-imposed limitations.\nNet interest margin (\"NIM\") - A measure of the net yield on our average spread-based assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of bank deposit account fees and net interest revenue by average spread-based assets.\nNet interest revenue - Net interest revenue is interest revenues less brokerage interest expense. Interest revenues are generated by charges to clients on margin balances maintained in margin accounts, the investment of cash from operations and segregated cash and interest earned on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense consists of amounts paid or payable to clients based on credit balances maintained in brokerage accounts and interest incurred on securities borrowing/securities lending. Brokerage interest expense does not include interest on our non-brokerage borrowings.\nNet new assets - Consists of total client asset inflows, less total client asset outflows, excluding activity from business combinations. Client asset inflows include interest and dividend payments and exclude changes in client\nassets due to market fluctuations. Net new assets are measured based on the market value of the assets as of the date of the inflows and outflows.\nNet new asset growth rate (annualized) - Annualized net new assets as a percentage of client assets as of the beginning of the period.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS - Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") are non-GAAP financial measures. We define non-GAAP net income as net income adjusted to remove the after-tax effect of amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and may be useful in evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating a meaningful comparison of our results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of our underlying business performance. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded as these costs are not representative of the costs of running our on-going business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS.\nOrder routing revenue - Revenues generated from payments and/or rebates received from market centers. Order routing revenue is a component of transaction-based revenues.\nSecurities borrowing - We borrow securities temporarily from other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed, and generally earn interest revenue on the cash deposited with the counterparty. We also incur interest expense for borrowing certain securities.\nSecurities lending - We loan securities temporarily to other broker-dealers in connection with our broker-dealer business. We receive cash as collateral for the securities loaned, and generally incur interest expense on the cash deposited with us. We also earn revenue for lending certain securities.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) - We sell securities to counterparties with an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same securities at a stated price plus interest on a specified date. We utilize repurchase agreements to finance our short-term liquidity and capital needs. Under these financing transactions, we receive cash from counterparties and provide U.S. Treasury securities as collateral.\nSegregated cash - Client cash and investments segregated in compliance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Customer Protection Rule) and other regulations. Interest earned on segregated cash is a component of net interest revenue.\nSpread-based assets - Client and brokerage-related asset balances, consisting of bank deposit account balances and interest-earning assets. Spread-based assets is used in the calculation of our net interest margin and our consolidated duration.\nTotal trades - Revenue-generating client securities trades, which are executed by our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries. Total trades are a significant source of our revenues. Such trades include, but are not limited to, trades in equities, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds and debt instruments. Trades generate revenue from commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction fees and/or order routing revenue.\nTrading days - Days in which the U.S. equity markets are open for a full trading session. Reduced exchange trading sessions are treated as half trading days.\nTransaction-based revenues - Revenues generated from client trade execution, consisting primarily of commissions, markups on riskless principal transactions in fixed income securities, transaction clearing fees and order routing revenue.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nWe provide securities brokerage and clearing services to our clients through our introducing and clearing broker-dealer subsidiaries. We also provide futures and foreign exchange trade execution services to our clients through our futures commission merchant (\"FCM\") and forex dealer member (\"FDM\") subsidiary. Substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services. Our primary focus is\nserving retail investors and traders and independent registered investment advisors by providing services with straightforward, affordable pricing.\nOur largest sources of revenues are asset-based revenues and transaction-based revenues. The primary factors driving our asset-based revenues are average balances and average rates. Average balances consist primarily of average client bank deposit account balances, average client margin balances, average segregated cash balances, average client credit balances, average fee-based investment balances and average securities borrowing and lending balances. Average rates consist of the average interest rates and fees earned and paid on such balances. The primary factors driving our transaction-based revenues are total client trades and average commissions per trade. Effective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, exchange traded funds (ETF) (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). For information regarding the expected impact of these price reductions to our net revenues, see \"Results of Operations\" later in this section. We also receive order routing revenue, which results from arrangements we have with many market centers to receive cash payments and/or rebates in exchange for routing orders to these firms for execution. Order routing revenue is included in commissions and transaction fees on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits. Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, group insurance, contributions to benefit programs, recruitment, severance and other related employee costs.\nClearing and execution costs include incremental third-party expenses that tend to fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in client accounts or trades. Examples of expenses included in this category are outsourced clearing services, statement and confirmation processing and postage costs and clearing expenses paid to the National Securities Clearing Corporation, option exchanges and other market centers. Communications expense includes telecommunications, other postage, news and quote costs. Occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces, software licensing and maintenance costs and maintenance expenses on computer hardware and other equipment. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of amounts allocated to the value of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions.\nProfessional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal, accounting, technology, regulatory, marketing and general management issues. Advertising costs include production and placement of advertisements in various media, including online, television, print and email, as well as client promotion and development costs. Advertising expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Other operating expenses include provision for bad debt losses, fraud and error losses, gains or losses on disposal of property, insurance expenses, travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. During fiscal year 2018, other operating expenses also included costs incurred related to the integration of Scottrade.\nInterest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our long-term debt and other borrowings. Gain on business-related divestiture represents the gain realized on the sale of TD Ameritrade Trust Company's (\"TDATC\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retirement plan custody and trust assets on June 28, 2019. Loss on sale of investments represents losses realized on corporate (non broker-dealer) investments.\nAcquisition of Scottrade\nOn September 18, 2017, we completed our acquisition of the brokerage business of Scottrade. The transaction combined highly complementary franchises and added significant scale to our retail business with the addition of approximately 3.5 million funded client accounts, extended our leadership in trading, and expanded the size of our branch network.\nFor additional information regarding this acquisition, see Note 2 - Business Acquisition under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results. Note 1, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management's judgments and estimates and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position.\nValuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets\nWe test goodwill and our indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset for impairment on at least an annual basis, or whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the Company as a whole. The estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting unit and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit. No impairment charges have resulted from our goodwill impairment tests.\nTo determine if the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we first assess certain qualitative factors. Based on this assessment, if it is determined that more likely than not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. No impairment charges have resulted from the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests.\nWe review our finite-lived acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period to determine if events or trends warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We have had no events or trends that have warranted a material revision to the originally estimated useful lives.\nEstimates of effective income tax rates, uncertain tax positions, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances\nWe estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current income tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. We must evaluate the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized. To the extent we determine that realization is not \"more likely than not,\" we establish a valuation allowance. Establishing or increasing a valuation allowance results in a corresponding increase to income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance can be reduced or is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, reducing income tax expense.\nWe must make significant judgments to calculate our provision for income taxes, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. We must also exercise judgment in determining the need for, and amount of, any accruals for uncertain tax positions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations to many types of transactions is subject to varying interpretations, amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements could be significantly changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing authorities.\nAccruals for contingent liabilities\nAccruals for contingent liabilities, such as legal and regulatory claims and proceedings, reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter. In making such estimates, we consider many factors, including the progress of the matter, prior experience and the experience of others in similar matters, available defenses, insurance coverage, indemnification provisions and the advice of legal counsel and other experts. In many matters, such as those in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter\nis close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Because matters may be resolved over long periods of time, accruals are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount accrued.\nResults of Operations\nConditions in the U.S. equity markets significantly impact the volume of our clients' trading activity. There is a relationship between the volume of our clients' trading activity and our results of operations. We cannot predict future trading volumes in the U.S. equity markets. If client trading activity increases, we generally expect that it would have a positive impact on our results of operations. If client trading activity declines, we generally expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in average client balances, especially bank deposit account, margin, credit and fee-based investment balances, may significantly impact our results of operations. Changes in interest rates also significantly impact our results of operations. We seek to mitigate interest rate risk by aligning the average duration of our interest-earning assets with that of our interest-bearing liabilities. We cannot predict the direction of interest rates or the levels of client balances. If interest rates rise, we generally expect to earn a larger net interest spread. Conversely, a falling interest rate environment generally would result in us earning a smaller net interest spread.\nEffective October 3, 2019, we reduced our online exchange-listed stock, ETFs (domestic and Canadian) and option trade commissions from $6.95 to $0 per trade (plus $0.65 per contract and no exercise or assignment fees on option trades). The expected impact of these price reductions on our net revenues for fiscal year 2020 is discussed later in this section.\nFinancial Performance Metrics\nNet income, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) are key metrics we use in evaluating our financial performance. Net income and diluted earnings per share are GAAP financial measures and EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe consider EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under the TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities.\nThe following table sets forth net income in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated, and provides reconciliations to EBITDA (dollars in millions):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Net\nRevenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018\nOur net income increased 50% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture, partially offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate and interest on borrowings. The effective income tax rate was lower in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") on December 22, 2017.\nOur EBITDA increased 47% for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in net revenues, a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and a $60 million gain on a business-related divestiture.\nOur diluted earnings per share increased 53% to $3.96 for fiscal year 2019 compared to $2.59 for fiscal year 2018, due to higher net income and a 2% decrease in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. Details regarding our fiscal year 2020 expectations for net revenues and expenses are presented later in this discussion.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017\nOur net income increased 69% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to an increase in net revenues and a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the enactment of the Act on December 22, 2017. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and interest on borrowings, and an $11 million loss on sale of investments during fiscal year 2018.
