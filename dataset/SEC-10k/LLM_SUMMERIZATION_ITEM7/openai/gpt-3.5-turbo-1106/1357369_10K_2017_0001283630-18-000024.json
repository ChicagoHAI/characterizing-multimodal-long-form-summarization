Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest owners, managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property portfolio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned operating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned properties under development:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - properties under development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we ultimately expect to be refinanced under the existing on-campus participating structure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2017 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for both the 2016/2017 academic year and the 2017/2018 academic year. As of September 30, 2016, the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, occupancy at our 2017 same store properties was 97.4% at a rental rate increase of 3.5% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2016 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 97.1%. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% at a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2017 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 95.5%. Our 2017 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale. Similarly, our 2018 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2017, we were under contract on three third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $13.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, fees of approximately $6.5 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates in July and August 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 37 properties that represented approximately 30,000 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition of Third-Party Development and Management Services\nDevelopment revenues are generally recognized based on a proportional performance method based on contract deliverables, while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method, as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs. For projects where our fee is based on a fixed price, any cost overruns incurred during construction, as compared to the original budget, will reduce the net fee generated on those projects. Incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party.\nWe also evaluate the collectability of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances, including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects, and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.\nPre-development expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third-party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred, until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and/or construction will commence. Because we frequently incur these pre-development expenditures before a financing commitment and/or required permits and authorizations have been obtained, we bear the risk of loss of these pre-development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations. As such, management evaluates the status of third-party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and/or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues. Such write-offs are included in third-party development and management services expenses (in the case of third-party development projects) or general and administrative expenses (in the case of owned development projects) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThird-party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts, revenues or a fixed monthly amount, in accordance with the applicable management contract. Incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met.\nAs discussed in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein, the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09 will change the methodology by which we recognize third-party development and management services revenue; however we do not expect such changes to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed. In some circumstances, lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures. These amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the funds are not available to us for current use.\nFor our properties under development, capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our total debt. Upon substantial completion of the properties, cost capitalization ceases. The total capitalized development costs are then transferred to the applicable asset category and depreciation commences. These estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two

classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017.\nSame store revenues are defined as revenues generated from our same store portfolio and consist of rental revenue earned from student leases as well as other income items such as utility income, damages, parking income, summer conference rent, application and administration fees, income from retail tenants, and income earned by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS\u201d) from ancillary activities such as the provision of food services.\nSame store operating expenses are defined as operating expenses generated from our same store

Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2017/2018 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2018/2019 academic year at our various properties.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to: (i) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of approximately $2.0 million related to cleanup and repairs for water intrusion, roofing, and landscaping at the Company's communities located in Florida and Texas, as a result of hurricanes Harvey and Irma; (ii) an increase in property taxes and related consulting fees due to increased property tax assessments in various markets as well as increases related to 2015 development deliveries caused primarily by the stabilization of property tax assessments in the second year of operations; (iii) additional marketing expenses incurred due to our efforts to achieve our leasing targets; and (iv) other general inflationary factors. We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in property taxes, insurance and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition/Opening Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University Crossings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Charlotte, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Syracuse, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Syracuse University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Arlie\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Arlington, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TWELVE at U District\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seattle, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The 515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eugene, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Oregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The James (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Madison, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Wisconsin -

Refer to Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP\u201d) Operations\nSame Store OCPP Properties: We had five on-campus participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Revenues from these properties increased by $0.5 million, from $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $1.0 million, from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) an increase in payroll costs due to recently filled staff positions, which were previously vacant; (ii) increased maintenance costs related to the annual turn process; (iii) an increase in utilities expense; and (iv) increases in general and administrative costs. Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2017/2018 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2018/2019 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our On-Campus Participating properties for 2018 will increase slightly as compared to 2017 as a result of general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue increased by approximately $6.2 million, from $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; and (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $1.1 million in 2017; and (ii) the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University of Kansas during the year ended December 31, 2016, for which the Company earned a $0.5 million fee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate third-party development services revenue to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a decrease in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2018.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services Expenses\nThird-party development and management services expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million, from $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight, and general inflation. We anticipate third-party development and management services expenses will increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 for the reasons discussed above.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.9 million, from $22.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) $4.5 million in contractual executive separation and retirement charges incurred in the first and second quarter 2017 as a result of the retirement of the former Company's Chief Financial Officer; (ii) $2.9 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with our initial investment in the Core Transaction in August 2017; (iii) increases in travel and related pursuit costs for potential acquisition transactions; (iv) additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating systems platform, and (v) other general inflationary factors. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017, as the increase in expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating system platforms, payroll and benefits expense, will be more than offset by nonrecurring expenses incurred in 2017, which include the executive separation and retirement charges with regard to the retirement of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer and transaction costs in connection with the Company's initial investment in the Core Transaction.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $23.6 million, from $211.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $235.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $16.3 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of seven owned development properties in August and September of 2016 and ten owned development properties in August 2017; (ii) a $12.1 million increase due to property acquisition activity during 2016 and 2017; (iii) a $7.9 million increase in depreciation expense at our same store properties due to capital improvement projects at various properties; and (iv) a $0.4 million increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were partially offset by a $13.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related to properties sold in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the completion of\nowned development projects in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018, as well as acquisitions in 2017, offset by property dispositions completed during 2017 and 2018.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.0 million, from $9.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017. We anticipate ground/facility leases expense to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the timing of new ACE projects being placed into service.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $15.3 million for one owned property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. During year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $4.9 million related to an owned property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016 and subsequently sold in April 2017. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of our property dispositions.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased by approximately $0.6 million, from $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily due to additional interest earned during 2016 on cash proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering. We expect interest income to remain relatively consistent with 2017 levels in 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $7.6 million, from $78.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense decreased as a result of the following: (i) a decrease of approximately $7.9 million related to the disposition of properties with outstanding mortgage debt during 2016; (ii) a $4.3 million decrease related to the pay-off of mortgage loans during 2017 and 2016; (iii) a decrease of approximately $4.1 million due to the pay-off of $450 million of outstanding term loan debt in 2016; (iv) a $3.6 million increase in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable twelve month periods; and (v) a decrease of $0.7 million related to lower outstanding balances on our mortgage debt due to continued scheduled principal payments. These decreases were partially offset by (i) a $4.6 million increase in interest related to closings of a new $300 million term loan in September 2017 and a new $200 million term loan in June 2017; (ii) a $3.8 million increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility; (iii) a $3.3 million increase in interest expense related to our $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017; and (iv) a $1.2 million increase in accrued default interest on one of our properties that is currently in receivership and is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017.\nWe anticipate interest expense will increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to increased interest rates on a higher average outstanding balance under the Company's revolving credit facility throughout 2018, an increase related to the closing of $500 million in term loans in 2017, additional interest incurred from the $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017, and additional interest incurred from any offerings of unsecured notes anticipated during 2018. These increases will be offset by the expected pay-off of outstanding mortgage and term loan debt scheduled to mature in 2018.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs decreased by approximately $1.9 million, from $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) $1.1 million of accelerated amortization related to the early pay-off of our $250 million term loan in February 2016; (ii) $0.7 million related to the pay-off of $200 million of our $350 million term loan in November 2016; and (iii) $0.3 million related to properties with mortgage debt sold in 2016. We anticipate amortization of deferred finance costs will increase in 2018 due to increases related to closings of a new $300 million term loan in September 2017 and a new $200 million term loan in June 2017, the $400 million offering of unsecured notes in October 2017, and offerings of unsecured notes anticipated during 2018.\n(Loss) Gain from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one owned property containing 657 beds, resulting in a net loss from disposition of real estate of approximately $0.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 21 owned properties containing 13,407 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $21.2 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred approximately $12.8 million of losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans in connection with the sale of nine owned properties.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent holders of common and preferred units in our Operating Partnership not held by ACC or ACC Holdings as well as certain third-party partners in joint ventures consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, these external partners are allocated their share of income/loss during the respective reporting periods. Refer to Note 9 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following

Revenues from these properties increased by $1.8 million, from $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 78.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 76.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $1.0 million, from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in utilities as compared to the prior year.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue decreased by approximately $0.4 million, from $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction for the Northeastern Illinois University project in May 2015 and commencement of construction of the Oregon State University - Cascades project in November 2015, both of which contributed a total of $2.5 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, versus $1.5 million in 2016; and (ii) the completion of construction of the development projects at the University of Toledo, Princeton University and Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, which contributed $2.2 million of revenue in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year ended December 31, 2016. These two projects contributed approximately $2.3 million in additional revenue in 2016. In addition, we earned a $0.5 million fee for the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University on Kansas during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had four\nprojects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $2.2 million.\nThird-Party Management Services Revenue\nThird-party management services revenue increased by approximately $0.9 million, from $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily a result of revenue earned from newly awarded management contracts, and the recognition of incentive fees from an existing third-party management contract during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.7 million, from $20.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional expenses incurred in connection with enhancements to our operating system platforms, additional payroll, health care and benefits expense, public company costs and other general inflationary factors.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by approximately $2.6 million, from $208.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $211.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) a $7.0 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of four owned development properties in August and September 2015; (ii) a $3.9 million increase related to the completion of construction and opening of seven owned development properties in August and September 2016; (iii) a $3.1 million increase due to property acquisition activity in 2015 and 2016; (iv) a $1.3 million increase due to renovation activities occurring at one of our owned properties during 2015; (v) a $1.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization at our same store properties; and (vi) a $0.3 increase in depreciation of corporate assets. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $14.1 million related to the sale of 21 properties in 2016 and 20 properties in 2015.\nGround/Facility Leases\nGround/facility leases expense increased by approximately $1.0 million, from $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to ACE development projects that completed construction and opened for operations in Fall 2015 and Fall 2016, as well as an increase in variable lease expense at two other ACE properties as a result of improved rental income.\nProvision for Real Estate Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a loss of approximately $4.9 million related to an impairment charge recognized for an owned property classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of our property dispositions.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by approximately $1.1 million, from $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to interest earned on cash proceeds from our February 2016 equity offering.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by approximately $9.1 million, from $87.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense decreased as a result of the following: (i) a decrease of $5.0 million related to the pay-off of mortgage loans during 2015 and 2016; (ii) a decrease of approximately $5.3 million due to the pay-off of $450 million of outstanding term loan debt during 2016; (iii) a decrease of approximately $5.1 million related to the disposition of properties with outstanding mortgage debt during 2015 and 2016; (iv) an increase of $2.6 million in capitalized interest due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the comparable twelve month periods; (v) a decrease of $1.9 million related to interest paid on our revolving credit facility; and (vi) a decrease of $0.7 million related to lower outstanding balances on our mortgage debt due to continued scheduled principal payments. These decreases\nwere mostly offset by the following (i) an increase of approximately $10.0 million related to our September 2015 $400 million offering of senior unsecured notes; and (ii) approximately $1.4 million of additional interest related to loans assumed in connection with 2015 property acquisitions.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs increased by approximately $0.9 million, from $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to $1.1 million of accelerated amortization related to the early pay-off of our $250 million term loan in February 2016.\nGain from Disposition of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 21 owned properties containing 13,407 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $21.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 20 owned properties containing 12,297 beds, resulting in a net gain from disposition of real estate of approximately $52.7 million. Refer to Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional details regarding our recent disposition transactions.\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred approximately $12.8 million of losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans in connection with the sale of nine owned properties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred approximately $1.8 million of losses associated with the early pay-off of mortgage loans in connection with the sale of four owned properties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Balances and Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2017, excluding our on-campus participating properties, we had $49.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to $32.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2016. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits, as required by law in certain states, and funds held in escrow in connection with potential acquisition and development opportunities. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 herein.\nOperating Activities: For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $320.0 million, as compared to approximately $308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $11.9 million. This increase in cash flows was due to operating cash flows provided by the completion of construction and opening of ten owned development properties in third quarter of 2017, and the completion of seven owned development projects in the third quarter of 2016, as well as property acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. The increase was partially offset by the timing of collections of our student accounts receivable as well as a decrease in operating cash flows related to properties disposed of during 2016 and 2017.\nInvesting Activities: Investing activities utilized approximately $977.8 million and $31.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $946.2 million increase in cash utilized in investing activities was primarily a result of the following: (i) a $547.0 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of owned properties, as we sold 21 properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the sale of one property during the year ended December 31, 2017; (ii) a $263.9 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017; (iii) a $110.7 million increase in cash used to fund the construction of our owned development properties, related to the timing of construction commencement and completion of our owned development pipeline; (iv) a $21.1 million increase in cash used to fund capital expenditures at our owned properties; and (v) an $8.0 million increase in cash paid to acquire undeveloped land parcels in 2017.\nFinancing Activities: Cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $676.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and cash utilized in financing activities totaled approximately $271.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The $948.0 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the following: (i) a $950.0 million net increase in proceeds from unsecured term loans; (ii) $399.6 million in proceeds from the offering of unsecured notes in October 2017; (iii) a $250.8 million decrease in cash used to pay off mortgage debt, including defeasance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2017; (iv) an increase of $35.7 million in proceeds from construction loans; and (v) $11.8 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $594.6 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock, related to our equity offering in February 2016 as compared to the issuance of common stock under our ATM Equity Program in 2017; (ii) a $75.1 million increase in distributions to noncontrolling partners due to the Company's initial investment in joint ventures; (iii) a $17.8 million increase in distributions to common and restricted stockholders; and (iv) an $11.2 million increase in payments of debt issuance costs due to the amendment of our revolving credit agreement in January 2017 and additional term loans in June and September 2017.\nLiquidity Needs, Sources and Uses of Capital\nAs of December 31, 2017, our short-term liquidity needs included, but were not limited to, the following: (i) the pay-off of a $300 million term loan due to mature in September 2018; (ii) anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately $241.5 million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of $1.76 per share and based on the number of our shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017; (iii) anticipated distribution payments to our Operating Partnership unitholders totaling approximately $1.9 million based on an assumed annual distribution of $1.76 per common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of 5.99% on our Preferred OP Units based on the number of units outstanding as of December 31, 2017; (iv) the pay-off of approximately $133.3 million of outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt scheduled to mature during the next 12 months as well as approximately $12.4 million of scheduled debt principal payments; (v) estimated development costs over the next 12 months totaling approximately $308.2 million for our owned properties currently under construction; (vi) a $42.2 million obligation to purchase a property subject to a presale arrangement (see Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8); (vii) an obligation to increase our investment in two joint ventures (the Core Joint Ventures\u201d), resulting in a funding commitment of approximately $130.6 million (see Note 5 and Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8); (viii) funds for other development projects scheduled to commence construction during the next 12 months; and (ix) potential future property or land acquisitions, including mezzanine financed developments.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements by (i) borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility; (ii) accessing the unsecured bond market; (iii) exercising debt extension options to the extent they are available; (iv) issuing securities, including common stock, under our ATM Equity Program discussed more fully in Note 11 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, or otherwise; (v) potentially disposing of properties and/or entering into joint venture arrangements, depending on market conditions; and (vi) utilizing current cash on hand and net cash provided by operations. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\nIn January 2017, the Company amended and expanded its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the facility size to $700 million and extending the maturity date to March 2022. The amended facility has an accordion feature that allows the Company to expand the facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowing rates under the credit facility float at a margin over LIBOR plus an annual facility fee with spreads reflecting current market terms which are more favorable than those contained in the prior facility. Both the margin and the facility fee are priced on a grid that is tied to the Company's credit rating. Based on the Company's current Baa2/BBB rating, the annual facility fee is 20 basis points and the LIBOR margin is 100 basis points, a reduction of 10 basis points from the prior facility.\nIn May 2017, the lender of the non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Blanton Common, an owned property located near Valdosta State University which was acquired as part of the GMH student housing transaction in 2008, sent a formal notice of default and initiated foreclosure proceedings. The property generated insufficient cash flow to cover the debt service on the $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the underlying property was in receivership and the Company was cooperating with the lender to allow for a consensual foreclosure process upon which the property will be surrendered to the lender in satisfaction of the mortgage loan.\nIn June 2017, the Company entered into a $200 million term loan which will mature in June 2022. The agreement has an accordion feature that allows the Company to expand the amount by up to an additional $100 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowing rates under this agreement float at a margin over LIBOR and the margin is priced on a grid that is tied to the Company's credit rating. Based on the Company's current Baa2/BBB rating, the LIBOR margin is 110 basis points.\nIn September 2017, the Company entered into a $300 million term loan which will mature in September 2018, and can be extended for two one-year periods at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The agreement has an accordion feature that allows the Company to expand the amount by up to an additional $100 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowing rates under this agreement float at a margin over LIBOR and the margin is priced on a grid that is tied to the Company's credit rating. Based on the Company's current Baa2/BBB rating, the LIBOR margin is 110 basis points.\nIn October 2017, we raised $395 million in net proceeds from an unsecured $400 million bond offering. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for potential repayment of other outstanding debt, to fund our development pipeline, for potential acquisitions of student housing properties and for general corporate purposes.\nWe may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls. We also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise. Future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing, including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity securities. These funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors, including future market conditions, our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets, our future creditworthiness, and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders, including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes. These financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders.\nIndebtedness\nA summary of our consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2017 is as follows. Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of our indebtedness.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Rates (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Maturities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,377,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consolidated debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,026,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project-based taxable bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2013 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2014 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2015 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2017 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total -

Distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. We may use borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund distributions. The Board of Directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels, including market factors and our Company's performance in addition to REIT requirements.\nOn January 23, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.44 per share, which was paid on February 16, 2018, to all common stockholders of record as of February 2, 2018. At the same time, the Operating Partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of Common Units, as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of Series A Preferred Units.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between the following five categories of capital expenditures:\nRecurring capital expenditures represent additions that are recurring in nature to maintain a property's income, value, and competitive position within the market. Recurring capital expenditures typically include, but are not limited to, appliances, furnishings, carpeting and flooring, HVAC equipment and kitchen/bath cabinets. Maintenance and repair costs incurred throughout the year including those incurred during our annual turn process due to normal wear and tear by residents are expensed as incurred.\nAcquisition-related capital expenditures represent additions identified upon acquiring a property and are considered part of the initial investment. These expenditures are intended to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards and are usually incurred within the first two and occasionally the third year after acquisition.\nRenovations and strategic repositioning capital expenditures are incurred to enhance the economic value and return of the property and undergo an investment return underwrite prior to being incurred.\nNon-recurring and other capital expenditures represent the addition of features or amenities that did not exist at the property but were deemed necessary to remain competitive within a specific market.

We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO excludes GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. We therefore believe that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, among other items, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (and as subsequently amended), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWe also believe it is meaningful to present a measure we refer to as FFO-Modified, or FFOM, which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our on-campus participating properties, and the elimination of property acquisition costs, contractual executive separation and retirement charges and other non-cash items, as we determine in good faith. Under our participating ground leases, we and the participating university systems each receive 50% of the properties' net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service (which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal) and capital expenditures. A substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness. These amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness. Therefore, unlike the ownership of our owned properties, the unique features of our ownership interest in our on-campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time. For example, since the ground/facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt, such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor. Accordingly, we believe it is meaningful to modify FFO to exclude the operations of our on-campus participating properties and to consider their impact on our performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive, both of which increase and decrease with the operating performance of the properties. This narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our third-party services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization. We believe, however, that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner's long-term profitability from its investment.\nOur FFOM may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on-campus participating properties, which is unique to us and is different from that of our owned off-campus properties. Companies\nthat are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures; and therefore those companies may not calculate FFOM in the same manner that we do, or at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP and FFO results and using FFOM only supplementally. Further, FFO and FFOM do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties. FFO and FFOM should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our liquidity, nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO and FFOM:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to ACC, Inc. and Subsidiaries common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) from disposition of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,699\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of provision for real estate impairment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders and OP unitholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of operations of on-campus participating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,194\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of investment in on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modifications to reflect operational performance of on-campus participating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our share of net cash flow (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution from on-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property acquisition costs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual executive separation and retirement charges (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of loss from early extinguishment of debt (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest owners, managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we ultimately expect to be refinanced under the existing on-campus participating structure.  We believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2017 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for both the 2016/2017 academic year and the 2017/2018 academic year. As of September 30, 2016, the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, occupancy at our 2017 same store properties was 97.4% at a rental rate increase of 3.5% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2016 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 97.1%. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% at a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2017 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 95.5%. Our 2017 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale. Similarly, our 2018 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2017, we were under contract on three third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $13.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, fees of approximately $6.5 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates in July and August 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 37 properties that represented approximately 30,000 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition of Third-Party Development and Management Services\nDevelopment revenues are generally recognized based on a proportional performance method based on contract deliverables, while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method, as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs. For projects where our fee is based on a fixed price, any cost overruns incurred during construction, as compared to the original budget, will reduce the net fee generated on those projects. Incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party.\nWe also evaluate the collectability of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances, including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects, and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.\nPre-development expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third-party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred, until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and/or construction will commence. Because we frequently incur these pre-development expenditures before a financing commitment and/or required permits and authorizations have been obtained, we bear the risk of loss of these pre-development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations. As such, management evaluates the status of third-party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and/or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues. Such write-offs are included in third-party development and management services expenses (in the case of third-party development projects) or general and administrative expenses (in the case of owned development projects) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThird-party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts, revenues or a fixed monthly amount, in accordance with the applicable management contract. Incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met.\nAs discussed in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein, the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09 will change the methodology by which we recognize third-party development and management services revenue; however we do not expect such changes to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets. The cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed. In some circumstances, lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures. These amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the funds are not available to us for current use.\nFor our properties under development, capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our total debt. Upon substantial completion of the properties, cost capitalization ceases. The total capitalized development costs are then transferred to the applicable asset category and depreciation commences. These estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods.\n\nSame Store and New Property Operations\nWe define our same store property portfolio as owned properties that were owned and operating for both of the full years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017.\nSame store revenues are defined as revenues generated from our same store portfolio and consist of rental revenue earned from student leases as well as other income items such as utility income, damages, parking income, summer conference rent, application and administration fees, income from retail tenants, and income earned by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS\u201d) from ancillary activities such as the provision of food services.\nSame store operating expenses are defined as operating expenses generated from our same store portfolio and include usual and customary expenses incurred to operate a property such as payroll, maintenance, utilities, marketing, general and administrative costs, insurance, property taxes, and bad debt. Same store operating expenses also include an allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight.\nA reconciliation of our same store, new property, and sold/held for sale property operations to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income is set forth below:\n\n (1) Does not include the allocation of payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight. \n (2) Includes one property that was sold in April 2017 and one property currently in receivership that is in the process of being transferred to the lender in settlement of the property's $27.4 million mortgage loan that matured in August 2017. \n (3) Includes properties sold in 2016 and 2017, and one property that is in the process of being transferred to the lender as discussed above. \n (4) Does not include properties under construction or undergoing redevelopment. \n (5) Difference from total operating property portfolio represents one property that was sold during the second quarter 2017. \n (6) Includes revenues which are reflected as resident services revenue on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. \nSame Store Properties: The increase in revenue from our same store properties was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 academic years, partially offset by a slight decrease in our weighted average occupancy from 94.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016, to 94.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2017/2018 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2018/2019 academic year at our various properties.\nThe increase in operating expenses from our same store properties was primarily due to: (i) an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of approximately $2.0 million related to cleanup and repairs for water intrusion, roofing, and landscaping at the Company's communities located in Florida and Texas, as a result of hurricanes Harvey and Irma; (ii) an increase in property taxes and related consulting fees due to increased property tax assessments in various markets as well as increases related to 2015 development deliveries caused primarily by the stabilization of property tax assessments in the second year of operations; (iii) additional marketing expenses incurred due to our efforts to achieve our leasing targets; and (iv) other general inflationary factors. We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in property taxes, insurance and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below:\n\n (1) The James and Hub U District Seattle are properties held by a joint venture formed as part of the Core Transaction. Refer to Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. \nOn-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP\u201d) Operations\nSame Store OCPP Properties: We had five on-campus participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Revenues from these properties increased by $0.5 million, from $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $1.0 million, from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) an increase in payroll costs due to recently filled staff positions, which were previously vacant; (ii) increased maintenance costs related to the annual turn process; (iii) an increase in utilities expense; and (iv) increases in general and administrative costs. Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2017/2018 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2018/2019 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our On-Campus Participating properties for 2018 will increase slightly as compared to 2017 as a result of general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue increased by approximately $6.2 million, from $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; and (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $1.1 million in 2017; and (ii) the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University of Kansas during the year ended December 31, 2016, for which the Company earned a $0.5 million fee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate third-party development services revenue to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a decrease in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2018.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services Expenses\nThird-party development and management services expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million, from $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight, and general inflation. We anticipate third-party development and management services expenses will increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 for the reasons discussed above.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.9 million, from $22.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $31.4", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Company and Our Business\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest owners, managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing and management of student housing properties. Refer to Item 1 contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives, investment strategies, and operating segments.\nProperty Portfolio\nBelow is a summary of our property portfolio as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property portfolio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned operating properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned properties under development:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-campus properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus ACE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal - properties under development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-campus participating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total owned property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes three properties at Prairie View A&M University that we ultimately expect to be refinanced under the existing on-campus participating structure.  We believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for our investors. We intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing.\nLeasing Results\nOur financial results for the 2017 calendar year are significantly impacted by the results of our annual leasing process for both the 2016/2017 academic year and the 2017/2018 academic year. As of September 30, 2016, the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, occupancy at our 2017 same store properties was 97.4% at a rental rate increase of 3.5% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2016 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 97.1%. As of September 30, 2017, the beginning of the 2017/2018 academic year, occupancy at our 2018 same store properties was 96.6% at a rental rate increase of 2.9% compared to the prior academic year, and occupancy at our total owned property portfolio (including 2017 acquisitions and development deliveries) was 95.5%. Our 2017 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale. Similarly, our 2018 same store property portfolio consists of properties owned and operating for both of the entire years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial development, redevelopment, or repositioning activities, and are not classified as held for sale.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services\nWe provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c) 3 foundations and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education. We develop student housing properties for these clients and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening. As of December 31, 2017, we were under contract on three third-party development projects that are currently under construction and whose fees total $13.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, fees of approximately $6.5 million remained to be earned by the Company with respect to these projects, which have scheduled completion dates in July and August 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we also provided third-party management and leasing services for 37 properties that represented approximately 30,000 beds. Our third-party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years.\nWhile fee revenue from our third-party development, construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities, this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio. Nevertheless, we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition of Third-Party Development and Management Services\nDevelopment revenues are generally recognized based on a proportional performance method based on contract deliverables, while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method, as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs. For projects where our fee is based on a fixed price, any cost overruns incurred during construction, as compared to the original budget, will reduce the net fee generated on those projects. Incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party.\nWe also evaluate the collectability of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances, including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects, and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.\nPre-development expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third-party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred, until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and/or construction will commence. Because we frequently incur these pre-development expenditures before a financing commitment and/or required permits and authorizations have been obtained, we bear the risk of loss of these pre-development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations. As such, management evaluates the status of third-party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and/or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues. Such write-offs are included in third-party development and management services expenses (in the case of third-party development projects) or general and administrative expenses (in the case of owned development projects) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThird-party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts, revenues or a fixed monthly amount, in accordance with the applicable management contract. Incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met.\nAs discussed in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein, the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09 will change the methodology by which we recognize third-party development and management services revenue; however we do not expect such changes to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nStudent Housing Rental Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nStudent housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned. In estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we analyze the aging of resident receivables, historical bad debts, and current economic trends. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income, as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income.\nAllocation of Fair Value to Acquired Properties\nThe price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors, including the condition of the buildings and improvements, the occupancy of the building, favorable or unfavorable financing, and numerous other factors. Accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes, among other items, determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, in-place tenant leases, tax incentive arrangements, and any debt assumed from the seller. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. Our calculation methodology is summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases (generally less than one year).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. These estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property, thereby reducing our net income. Management also performs a periodic assessment to determine which of our properties are likely to be sold prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. For those probable sales, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount of the property over the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs, thereby reducing our net income.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition-related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property. (Acquisition-related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards). We capitalize non-recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements. In addition, we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting, roofing, and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets.

These estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December

We anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio for 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in property taxes, insurance and general inflation.\nNew Property Operations: Our new properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition/Opening Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University Crossings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Charlotte, NC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Syracuse, NY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Syracuse University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Arlie\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Arlington, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TWELVE at U District\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Seattle, WA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The 515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eugene, OR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Oregon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fort Collins, CO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The James (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Madison, WI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Wisconsin -

Refer to Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. \nOn-Campus Participating Properties ( OCPP\u201d) Operations\nSame Store OCPP Properties: We had five on-campus participating properties containing 5,086 beds which were operating during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Revenues from these properties increased by $0.5 million, from $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 76.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating expenses at these properties increased by $1.0 million, from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) an increase in payroll costs due to recently filled staff positions, which were previously vacant; (ii) increased maintenance costs related to the annual turn process; (iii) an increase in utilities expense; and (iv) increases in general and administrative costs. Future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the 2017/2018 academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the 2018/2019 academic year. We anticipate that operating expenses for our On-Campus Participating properties for 2018 will increase slightly as compared to 2017 as a result of general inflation.\nThird-Party Development Services Revenue\nThird-party development services revenue increased by approximately $6.2 million, from $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of a fourth phase at the University of California, Irvine in the third quarter of 2017, the closing of bond financing and the commencement of construction of the University of Illinois - Chicago project in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the commencement of construction of the University of Arizona Honors College in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which contributed a total of $6.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017; and (ii) the performance of advisory services related to a not-for-profit entity's purchase of an apartment community for the benefit of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, for which the Company earned a $1.4 million fee in 2017. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction of two development projects with the Texas A&M University System at their Corpus Christi and San Antonio campuses during the year ended December 31, 2016, both of which contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $1.1 million in 2017; and (ii) the performance of various predevelopment activities for the University of Kansas during the year ended December 31, 2016, for which the Company earned a $0.5 million fee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $3.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately $1.8 million.\nDevelopment services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects, the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project. In addition, to the extent projects are completed under budget, we may be entitled to a portion of such savings, which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties, or when performance has been verified by an independent third-party. It is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre-development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs. The pre-development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then-current period. We anticipate third-party development services revenue to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a decrease in the volume and timing of third-party development projects anticipated to close and commence construction in 2018.\nThird-Party Development and Management Services Expenses\nThird-party development and management services expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million, from $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in payroll and other administrative costs related to corporate management and oversight, and general inflation. We anticipate third-party development and management services expenses will increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 for the reasons discussed above.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $8.9 million, from $22.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, to $31.4"}
