MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nUtility Holdings generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers. Utility Holdings' primary source of cash flow results from the collection of customer bills and payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services. Utility Holdings segregates its utility operations between a Gas Utility Services operating segment and an Electric Utility Services operating segment.\nVectren has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management. The committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of Utility Holdings' SEC filings.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nExecutive Summary of Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring 2015, Utility Holdings earned $160.9 million, compared to $148.4 million in 2014 and $141.8 million in 2013. The improved results in 2015 compared to 2014 are largely driven by returns earned on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs, offset somewhat by a decrease in electric margin primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather in the fourth quarter of 2014. Decreases in operating expenses related to performance-based compensation and the timing of power plant maintenance costs also favorably impacted earnings, as did increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Results in 2014 compared to 2013 reflect increased gas and electric margins. However, these increased margins were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in performance-based compensation expense and gas system maintenance resulting from the harsh winter in the first part of 2014.\nGas utility services\nThe gas utility segment earned $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $57.0 million in 2014 and $55.7 million in 2013. The improved results in the periods presented are primarily due to increased returns on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs as the investment in those programs continues to increase. Increased earnings in 2015 also resulted from growth in small customer count and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense. These increases were somewhat offset by the unfavorable impacts of weather on the Company's Ohio business in 2015. The increased margin in 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by higher operating expenses from increased performance-based compensation expense and increased weather-related maintenance of the gas system during the first half of 2014.\nElectric utility services\nThe electric operations earned $82.6 million during 2015, compared to $79.7 million in 2014 and $75.8 million in 2013. Results in 2014 reflected the favorable impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimated the after tax impact to be approximately $2.2 million compared to 2015. Lower wholesale margin due primarily to lower market pricing also reduced 2015 results when compared to 2014. Lower operating expenses in 2015 driven primarily by decreases in power plant maintenance costs and performance-based compensation, favorably impacted 2015 results. Improved 2014 results compared to 2013 were due primarily to the impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimates the after tax impact to be approximately $1.1 million favorable compared to 2013 as well as an increase in lost revenue recovery margin related to electric conservation programs, which had an after tax favorable impact of $2.3 million. These improved results were offset somewhat by higher operating costs, including higher performance-based compensation and the acceleration of power supply maintenance projects completed in 2014.\nOther utility operations\nIn 2015, earnings from other utility operations were $13.9 million, compared to $11.7 million in 2014 and $10.3 million in 2013. An increase in earnings was driven by a lower effective income tax rate in 2015, from increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Approximately $3.5 million of this increase was related to research\nand development tax credits for prior periods as the Internal Revenue Service recently issued guidance that provided clarifications of internal-use software that qualifies for the credit. The revaluation of deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels and the rate reduction from a change in the Indiana tax legislation passed in 2014, resulted in higher earnings in 2014 compared to 2013.\nThe Regulatory Environment\nGas and electric operations are regulated by the IURC, with regard to retail rates and charges, terms of service, accounting matters, financing, and certain other operational matters specific to its Indiana customers (the operations of SIGECO and Indiana Gas). The retail gas operations of VEDO are subject to regulation by the PUCO.\nIn the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. Similar usage risks in Ohio are diminished by a straight fixed variable rate design for the Company's residential customers. In addition to these mechanisms, the commissions have authorized gas infrastructure replacement programs in all natural gas service territories, which allow for recovery of these investments outside of a base rate case proceeding. Further, rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment (GCA) clause and electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause (FAC). Both of these cost tracker mechanisms allow for the timely adjustment in charges to reflect changes in the cost of gas and cost for fuel. The Company utilizes similar mechanisms for other material operating costs, which allow for changes in revenue outside of a base rate case. Primarily as a result of rate mechanisms, the Company's last increase in base rates was 2011 for its electric business and 2009 for its gas business.\nRate Design Strategies\nSales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather. Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as the Company's utilities have implemented conservation programs. In the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. The Ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers. This rate design, which was fully implemented in February 2010, mitigates approximately 90 percent of the Ohio service territory's weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small customer classes.\nIn all natural gas service territories, the commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs. In Indiana, state laws were passed in 2012 and 2013 that expand the ability of utilities to recover, outside of a base rate proceeding, certain costs of federally mandated projects and other significant gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments. Legislation was passed in 2011 in Ohio that support the investment in other capital projects, allowing the utility to defer the impacts of these investments until its next base rate case. The Company has received approval to implement these mechanisms in both states.\nSIGECO's electric service territory currently recovers certain transmission investments outside of base rates. The electric service territory has neither an NTA nor a decoupling mechanism; however, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives.\nTracked Operating Expenses\nGas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve Indiana customers are two of the Company's most significant operating expenses. Rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment clause. The GCA clause allows the Company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas, inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on actual experience and subject to caps that are based on historical experience. Electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel. The net energy cost of purchased power, subject to an approved variable benchmark based on The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices, is also timely recovered through the FAC.\nGCA and FAC procedures involve periodic filings and IURC hearings to establish price adjustments for a designated future period. The procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the\nestimated costs and actual costs incurred. Since April 2010, the Company has not been the supplier of natural gas in its Ohio territory.\nThe IURC has also applied the statute authorizing GCA and FAC procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test. In the periods presented, the Company has not been impacted by the earnings test.\nIn Indiana, gas pipeline integrity management operating costs, costs to fund energy efficiency programs, MISO costs, and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery. In addition, certain operating costs, including depreciation associated with federally mandated investments, gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments, and regional electric transmission assets not in base rates are also recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery.\nIn Ohio, expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense, costs associated with exiting the merchant function, and costs associated with the infrastructure replacement program and other gas distribution capital expenditures are subject to recovery outside of base rates.\nRevenues and margins in both states are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes, which primarily fluctuate with gas and fuel costs.\nBase Rate Orders\nOver the last eight years, regulatory orders establishing new base rates have been received by each utility. SIGECO's electric territory received an order in April 2011, with rates effective May 2011, and its gas territory received an order and implemented rates in August 2007. Indiana Gas received its most recent base rate order and implemented rates in February 2008, and VEDO received an order in January 2009, with implementation in February 2009. The orders authorize a return on equity ranging from 10.15 percent to 10.40 percent. The authorized returns reflect the impact of rate design strategies that have been authorized by these state commissions.\nSee the Rate and Regulatory Matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the Company's utilities over the last three years.\nOperating Trends\nMargin\nThroughout this discussion, the terms Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin are used. Gas utility margin is calculated as Gas utility revenues less the Cost of gas sold. Electric utility margin is calculated as Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power. The Company believes Gas utility and Electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and these are generally collected on a dollar-for-dollar basis from customers.\nIn addition, the Company separately reflects regulatory expense recovery mechanisms within Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin. These amounts represent dollar-for-dollar recovery of other operating expenses. The Company utilizes these approved regulatory mechanisms to recover variations in operating expenses from the amounts reflected in base rates and are generally expenses that are subject to volatility. Following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations.\nGas utility margin\nGas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas utility revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of gas sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gas utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Regulatory expense recovery mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gas utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sold & transported volumes in MMDth attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sold & transported volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas utility margins were $487.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and compared to 2014, increased $11.3 million. Margin increased from returns on infrastructure replacement programs in Indiana and Ohio of $14.1 million compared to 2014. Customer margin also increased $1.5 million compared to 2014 from small customer growth. With rate designs that substantially limit the impact of weather on margin, heating degree days that were 95 percent of normal in Ohio and 88 percent of normal in Indiana during 2015, compared to 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, had only a slight unfavorable impact on small customer margin. However, warmer weather did decrease sold and transported volumes, resulting in lower regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding decrease in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin decreased $2.4 million compared to 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gas utility margins increased $24.0 million compared to 2013. Heating degree days that were 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, compared to 103 percent of normal in Ohio and 102 percent of normal in Indiana during 2013, had a slight favorable impact on small customer margin. Colder weather increased sold and transported volumes, which was the primary driver in the higher regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding increase in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin increased $15.0 million compared to 2013. Customer margin increased $3.8 million compared to 2013 from small customer growth and large customer usage. Additionally, margin was favorably impacted by $3.5 million from the return from infrastructure replacement programs, particularly in Ohio in 2014 compared to 2013.\nElectric utility margin (Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power)\nElectric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric utility revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of fuel & purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total electric utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Regulatory expense recovery mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal: retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Wholesale power & transmission system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total electric utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric volumes sold in GWh attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,714.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,762.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,722.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,804.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,735.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total retail volumes sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,458.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,589.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,479.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail\nElectric retail utility margins were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, compared to 2014, decreased by $6.7 million. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, reflect a $3.6 million decrease from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 88 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 107 percent of normal in 2014. While cooling degree days were 111 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 104 percent of normal in 2014, the increase in margin resulting from the increase in cooling degree days only partially offset the large decrease caused by the warmer winter in 2015. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $0.7 million compared to the prior year. Results also reflect a decrease in large customer usage of $1.5 million largely driven by timing of customer plant maintenance resulting in lower customer throughput. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms decreased $2.0 million as operating expenses associated with the electric conservation programs decreased.\nIn 2014, Electric retail utility margins were $389.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and, compared to 2013, increased by $9.3 million. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $3.9 million compared to 2013. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, experienced a $1.8 million increase from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 107 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 102 percent of normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 104 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 103 percent of normal in 2013. Results also reflect increased large customer usage, which had a favorable margin impact of $2.0 million. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms increased $1.1 million driven primarily by a corresponding increase in operating expenses associated with MISO costs.\nOn December 3, 2013, SABIC Innovative Plastics (SABIC), a large industrial utility customer of the Company, announced its plans to build a cogeneration (cogen) facility to be operational at the end of 2016 or early in 2017, in order to generate power to meet a significant portion of its ongoing power needs. Electric service is currently provided to SABIC by the Company under a long-term contract that expires in May of 2016. SABIC's historical peak electric usage has been approximately 120 megawatts (MW). The cogen facility is expected to provide approximately 80 MW of capacity. Therefore, the Company will continue to provide all of SABIC's power requirements above the approximate 80 MW capacity of the cogen, which is projected to be approximately 40 MW. The Company will also provide back-up power, when required.\nMargin from Wholesale Electric Activities\nThe Company earns a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the Company in its service territory that meet the criteria of the MISO's regional transmission expansion plans and also markets and sells its generating and transmission capacity\nto optimize the return on its owned assets. Substantially all off-system sales are generated in the MISO Day Ahead and Real Time markets when sales into the MISO in a given hour are greater than amounts purchased for native load. Further detail of MISO off-system margin and transmission system margin follows:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MISO transmission system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MISO off-system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total wholesale margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransmission system margin associated with qualifying projects, including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms, and other transmission system operations, totaled $25.5 million during 2015, compared to $26.1 million in 2014 and $29.4 million in 2013. Results in 2015 and 2014 reflect lower returns on transmission investments associated with pending FERC ROE complaints. To date, the Company has invested $157.7 million in qualifying projects. The net plant balance for these projects totaled $140.2 million at December 31, 2015. These projects include an interstate 345 kV transmission line that connects the Company's A.B. Brown Generating Station to a generating station in Indiana owned by Duke Energy to the north and to a generating station in Kentucky owned by Big Rivers Electric Corporation to the south; a substation; and another transmission line. Although the allowed return is currently being challenged as discussed below in Rate and Regulatory Matters, once placed into service, these projects earn a FERC approved equity rate of return of 12.38 percent on the net plant balance. Operating expenses are also recovered. The Company has established a reserve pending the outcome of these complaints. The 345 kV project is the largest of these qualifying projects, with a cost of $106.8 million that earned the FERC approved equity rate of return, including while under construction. The last segment of that project was placed into service in December 2012.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, margin from off-system sales was $6.2 million, compared to $7.8 million in 2014 and $7.2 million in 2013. The base rate changes implemented in May 2011 require that wholesale margin from off-system sales earned above or below $7.5 million per year are shared equally with customers. Results in 2015 compared to 2014 reflect lower market pricing due to low natural gas prices, net of sharing. Off-system sales were 337.8 GWh in 2015, compared to 651.1 GWh in 2014, and 514.4 GWh in 2013.\nOperating Expenses\nOther Operating\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Other operating expenses were $339.1 million, and compared to 2014, decreased $15.4 million. The decrease in operating costs for the year is primarily due to decreases in costs not recovered directly in margin. Excluding pass through costs, other operating expenses decreased $15.3 million compared to 2014, primarily from a decrease in performance-based compensation expense of $7.1 million and decreased expenses in power plant maintenance costs of $6.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, Other operating expenses increased $21.1 million compared to 2013. Costs recovered directly in margin account for $12.4 million of the increase during 2014. Excluding these pass through costs, other operating expenses increased $8.7 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily from an increase in performance-based compensation expense of $5.5 million and increased expenses related to gas system maintenance of $4.3 million largely due to the harsh winter weather in the first part of 2014.\nDepreciation & Amortization\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Depreciation and amortization expense was $208.8 million, compared to $203.1 million in 2014 and $196.4 million in 2013. Results in the periods presented reflect increased utility plant investments placed into service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $3.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $3.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to decreased gas costs and thus lower revenues and related revenue taxes.\nThe increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher revenue taxes associated with increased consumption and higher gas costs.\nOther Income-Net\nOther income-net reflects income of $18.7 million in 2015, compared to $16.8 million in 2014 and $10.5 million in 2013. Results include increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) of approximately $4.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. These increases are partially offset by decreases in returns on assets that fund certain benefit plans. Results in 2014 also reflect increased AFUDC of $7.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increased AFUDC in the periods presented is driven by increased capital expenditures related to gas utility infrastructure replacement investments.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Utility Holdings' federal and state income taxes were $88.1 million, compared to $83.2 million in 2014 and $85.3 million in 2013. While income taxes increased primarily due to increased income in 2015, the effective tax rate in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to an increase in research and development tax credits. The decrease in income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the revaluation of Utility Holdings' deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels, Inc. in 2014. Additionally, 2015 and 2014 reflect increases in tax deductions for domestic production activity compared to 2013.\nGas Rate and Regulatory Matters\nRegulatory Treatment of Investments in Natural Gas Infrastructure Replacement\nThe Company monitors and maintains its natural gas distribution system to ensure natural gas is delivered in a safe and efficient manner. The Company's natural gas utilities are currently engaged in programs to replace bare steel and cast iron infrastructure and other activities in both Indiana and Ohio to mitigate risk, improve the system, and comply with applicable regulations, many of which are a result of federal pipeline safety requirements. Laws passed in both Indiana and Ohio provide utilities the opportunity to timely recover costs of federally mandated projects and other infrastructure improvement projects outside of a base rate proceeding.\nIn April 2011, Indiana Senate Bill 251 (Senate Bill 251) was signed into Indiana law. The law provides a framework to recover 80 percent of federally mandated costs through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case. Such costs include a return on the federally mandated capital investment, based on the overall rate of return most recently approved by the Commission, along with recovery of depreciation and other operating costs associated with these mandates. The remaining 20 percent of those costs is deferred for future recovery in the utility's next general rate case.\nIn April 2013, Indiana Senate Bill 560 (Senate Bill 560) was signed into Indiana law. This legislation supplements Senate Bill 251 described above, and provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for projects that either improve electric and gas system reliability and safety or are economic development projects that provide rural areas with access to gas service. Provisions of the legislation require that, among other things, requests for recovery include a seven-year project plan. Once the plan is approved by the IURC, 80 percent of such costs are eligible for current recovery using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on the investment that reflects the current capital structure and associated costs, with the exception of the rate of return on equity, which remains fixed at the rate determined in the Company's last rate case. Recoverable costs also include recovery of depreciation and other operating expenses. The remaining 20 percent of project costs are deferred and recovered in the utility's next general rate case, which must be filed before the expiration of the seven-year plan. The adjustment mechanism is capped at an annual increase in retail revenues of no more than two percent.\nIn June 2011, Ohio House Bill 95 (House Bill 95) was signed into law. Outside of a base rate proceeding, this legislation permits a natural gas utility to apply for recovery of much of its capital expenditure program. The legislation also allows for the deferral of costs, such as depreciation, property taxes, and debt-related post-in-service carrying costs until recovery is approved by the PUCO.\nIndiana Recovery and Deferral Mechanisms\nThe Company's Indiana natural gas utilities received Orders in 2008 and 2007 associated with the most recent base rate cases. These Orders authorized the deferral of financial impacts associated with bare steel and cast iron replacement activities. The Orders provide for the deferral of depreciation and post-in-service carrying costs on qualifying projects totaling $20 million annually at Indiana Gas and $3 million annually at SIGECO. The debt-related post-in-service carrying costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income currently. The recording of post-in-service carrying costs and depreciation deferral is limited by individual qualifying projects to three years after being placed into service at SIGECO and four years after being placed into service at Indiana Gas. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company has regulatory assets totaling $19.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, associated with the deferral of depreciation and debt-related post-in-service carrying cost activities. Beginning in 2014, all bare steel and cast iron replacement activities are now part of the Company's seven-year capital investment plan filed pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, discussed further below.\nRequests for Recovery under Indiana Regulatory Mechanisms\nOn August 27, 2014, the IURC issued an Order (August 2014 Order) approving the Company's seven-year capital infrastructure replacement and improvement plan, beginning in 2014, and the proposed accounting authority and recovery. Compliance projects and other infrastructure improvement projects were approved pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, respectively. As provided in the two laws, the Order approved semi-annual filings for rate recovery of 100 percent of the costs, inclusive of return, related to these capital investments and operating expenses, with 80 percent of the costs, including a return, recovered currently via an approved tracking mechanism and 20 percent of the costs deferred and recovered in the Company's next base rate proceeding. In addition, the Order established guidelines to annually update the seven-year capital investment plan. Finally, the Order approved the Company's proposal to recover eligible costs via a fixed monthly charge per residential customer.\nOn September 26, 2014, the OUCC filed an appeal of the IURC's finding that the remaining value of retired assets replaced during the infrastructure projects should not be netted against the cost being recovered in the tracking mechanism. In June 2015, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued an opinion in favor of the Company that affirmed the IURC's August 2014 Order approving the infrastructure plan.\nOn January 14, 2015, the IURC issued an Order approving the Company's initial request for recovery of the revenue requirement through June 30, 2014 as part of its approved seven-year plan. Also, consistent with the guidelines set forth in the original August 2014 Order, the IURC approved the Company's update to its seven-year plan, to reflect changes to project prioritization as a result of both additional risk modeling and changes to estimated project costs.\nOn April 1, 2015, the Company filed its second request for recovery of the revenue requirement associated with capital investment and applicable operating costs through December 31, 2014. On June 1, 2015, the Company amended its case to delay the recovery of a portion of the investment associated with Senate Bill 560 made from July 2014 to December 2014, until its third filing when it committed to provide additional project detail for the later years of the plan. This commitment was as a result of an Indiana Court of Appeals decision regarding the approval of Northern Indiana Public Service Company's (NIPSCO) proposed electric Transmission, Distribution, and Storage Improvement Charge (TDSIC) plan, and challenges to TDSIC plans filed by other Indiana utilities.\nOn July 22, 2015, the IURC issued an Order, approving the recovery of these investments consistent with the Company's proposal, with modification, specifically to the rate of return applicable to the Senate Bill 251 compliance component. The IURC found that the overall rate of return to be applied to the investment in determining the revenue requirement is to be updated with each filing, reflecting the current capital structure and associated costs, with the exception of the rate of return on equity, which remains fixed at the rate determined in the Company's last base rate case. This IURC interpretation of the overall rate of return to be used is the same as that already in place for the Senate Bill 560 component.\nOn October 1, 2015, the Company filed its third request for recovery of the revenue requirement associated with capital investment and applicable operating costs through June 30, 2015, including investment associated with Senate Bill 560 made from July 2014 to December 2014 that had been delayed in the second request. The Company provided an update to its seven-year plan, as well as additional detail on the planned investments included in the plan. The updated plan reflects capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, an increase of $100 million from the previous plan, of which $272 million has been spent as of December 31, 2015. The ability to include new projects as part of an updated Senate Bill 560 plan has been challenged in this case.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Commission has approved project categories that encompass planned infrastructure investments during the plan term of approximately $800 million of the proposed $1 billion of capital spend. The remaining proposed amount is now pending approval in the third request for recovery. Pursuant to the process outlined in Senate Bill 560, the Company expects an order in early 2016.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company has regulatory assets totaling $28.6 million and $11.4 million, respectively, associated with the return on investment as well as the deferral of depreciation and other operating expenses.\nOhio Recovery and Deferral Mechanisms\nThe PUCO Order approving the Company's 2009 base rate case in the Ohio service territory authorized a distribution replacement rider (DRR). The DRR's primary purpose is recovery of investments in utility plant and related operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast iron pipelines and certain other infrastructure. This rider is updated annually for qualifying capital expenditures and allows for a return on those capital expenditures based on the rate of return approved in the 2009 base rate case. In addition, deferral of depreciation and the ability to accrue debt-related post-in-service carrying costs is also allowed until the related capital expenditures are included in the DRR. The Order also initially established a prospective bill impact evaluation on the annual deferrals. To date, the Company has made capital investments under this rider totaling $202.5 million. Regulatory assets associated with post-in-service carrying costs and depreciation deferrals were $18.2 million and $13.1 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Due to the expiration of the initial five-year term for the DRR in early 2014, the Company filed a request in August 2013 to extend and expand the DRR. On February 19, 2014, the PUCO issued an Order approving a Stipulation entered into by the PUCO Staff and the Company which provided for the extension of the DRR for the recovery of costs incurred through 2017 and expanded the types of investment covered by the DRR to include recovery of other infrastructure investments. The Order limits the resulting DRR fixed charge per month for residential and small general service customers to specific graduated levels over the next five years. The Company's five-year capital expenditure plan related to these infrastructure investments for calendar years 2013 through 2017 totals approximately $200 million. The capital expenditure plan is subject to the graduated caps on the fixed DRR monthly charge applicable to residential and small general service customers approved in the Order; however, the plan is not expected to exceed those caps. In addition, the Order approved the Company's commitment that the DRR can only be further extended as part of a base rate case. On August 26, 2015, the Company received an Order approving its adjustment to the DRR for recovery of costs incurred through December 31, 2014.\nGiven the extension of the DRR through 2017 as discussed above and the continued ability to defer other capital expenses under House Bill 95, it is anticipated that the Company will file a general rate case for the inclusion in rate base of the above costs near the expiration of the DRR. As such, the bill impact limits discussed below are not expected to be reached given the Company's capital expenditure plan during the remaining two-year time frame.\nThe PUCO has also issued Orders approving the Company's filings under Ohio House Bill 95. These Orders approve deferral of the Company's Ohio capital expenditure program for items not covered by the DRR as well as expenditures necessary to comply with PUCO rules, regulations, orders, and system expansion to some new customers. Ohio House Bill 95 Orders also have established a prospective bill impact evaluation on the cumulative deferrals, limiting the total deferrals at a level which would equal $1.50 per residential and small general service customer per month. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's deferrals have not reached this bill impact cap. In addition, the Orders approved the Company's proposal that subsequent requests for accounting authority will be filed annually in April. The Company submitted its most recent annual filing on April 30, 2015, which covers the Company's capital expenditure program through calendar year 2015. During 2015 and 2014, these approved capital expenditure programs under House Bill 95 generated Other income associated with the debt-related post-in-service carrying costs totaling $6.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Deferral of deprecation and property tax expenses related to these programs in 2015 and 2014 totaled $5.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nIndiana Gas GCA Cost Recovery Issue\nOn July 1, 2014, Indiana Gas filed its recurring quarterly Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA) mechanism, which included recovery of gas cost variances incurred for the period January through March 2014. In August 2014, the OUCC filed testimony opposing the recovery of approximately $3.9 million of natural gas commodity purchases incurred during this period on the basis that a gas cost incentive calculation had not been properly performed. The calculation at issue is performed by the Company's supply administrator. In the winter period at issue, a pipeline force majeure event caused the gas to be priced at a location that was impacted by the extreme winter temperatures. After further review, the OUCC modified its position in testimony filed on November 5, 2014, and suggested a reduced disallowance of $3 million. The IURC moved this specific issue to a sub-docket proceeding. On April 1, 2015, a stipulation and settlement agreement between the Company, the OUCC, and the Company's supply administrator was filed in this proceeding. The IURC issued an Order on June 10, 2015 which approved the stipulation and settlement agreement, which resulted in recovery of approximately $1.4 million of the disputed amount via the Company's GCA mechanism, with the remaining $1.6 million received from the gas supply administrator.\nIndiana Gas & SIGECO Gas Decoupling Extension Filing\nOn September 9, 2015, the IURC issued an Order granting the extension of the current decoupling mechanism in place at both Indiana gas companies and recovery of conservation program costs through December 2019.\nElectric Rate and Regulatory Matters\nSIGECO Electric Environmental Compliance Filing\nOn January 28, 2015, the IURC issued an Order (January Order) approving the Company's request for approval of capital investments on its coal-fired generation units to comply with new EPA mandates related to mercury and air toxic standards (MATS) effective in 2015 and to address an outstanding Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $30 million has been spent on equipment to control mercury in both air and water emissions, and $29 million to address the issues raised in the NOV proceeding on the increase in sulfur trioxide emissions. The total investment is estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million. The Order approved the Company's request for deferred accounting treatment, as supported by provisions under Indiana Senate Bill 29 (Senate Bill 29) and Senate Bill 251. The accounting treatment includes the deferral of depreciation and property tax expense related to these investments, accrual of post-in-service carrying costs, and deferral of incremental operating expenses related to compliance with these standards. The initial phase of the projects went into service in 2014, with the remaining investment occurring in 2015 and 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has approximately $2.7 million deferred related to depreciation, property tax, and operating expense, and $1.1 million deferred related to post-in-service carrying costs.\nIn March 2015, the Company was notified that certain parties had filed a Notice of Appeal with the Indiana Court of Appeals in response to the IURC's Order. In June 2015, Joint Appellants' Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc. (the appellants) filed a brief which challenged the sufficiency of the findings in the IURC's January Order approving the Company's investments and proposed accounting treatment in terms of whether that Order made certain findings required by statute. On October 29, 2015, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued its opinion affirming the IURC's findings with regard to equipment required to comply with MATS and certain national pollutant discharge elimination system rules (approximately $35 million). The Court remanded the case back to the IURC so that it can make the findings required by statute with regard to equipment required by the NOV (approximately $40 million). On February 12, 2016, the appellants filed a petition to reopen the evidentiary record in the case in order to submit additional evidence. The Company has opposed the motion and believes the IURC already has a sufficient record in this case. As it pertains to the equipment requirement required by the NOV, given the Commission's previous approval of this project, the Company believes the Commission will make these findings and issue a new order in support of the project.\nSIGECO Electric Demand Side Management (DSM) Program Filing\nOn August 31, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving an initial three-year DSM plan in the SIGECO electric service territory that complied with the IURC's energy saving targets. Consistent with the Company's proposal, the Order approved, among other items, the following: 1) recovery of costs associated with implementing the DSM Plan; 2) the recovery of a performance incentive mechanism based on measured savings related to certain DSM programs; 3) lost margin recovery associated with the\nimplementation of DSM programs for large customers. On June 20, 2012, the IURC issued an Order approving a small customer lost margin recovery mechanism, inclusive of all previous deferrals. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized electric utility revenue of $10.1 million, $8.7 million, and $5.0 million, respectively, associated with this approved lost margin recovery mechanism.\nOn March 28, 2014, Indiana Senate Bill 340 was signed into law. This legislation ended electric DSM programs on December 31, 2014 that had been conducted to meet the energy savings requirements established by the IURC in 2009. The legislation also allows for industrial customers to opt out of participating in energy efficiency programs. As of January 1, 2015, approximately 80 percent of the Company's eligible industrial load has opted out of participation in the applicable energy efficiency programs. The Company filed a request for IURC approval of a new portfolio of DSM programs on May 29, 2014 to be offered in 2015. On October 15, 2014, the IURC issued an Order approving a Settlement between the OUCC and the Company regarding the new portfolio of DSM programs effective January 2015, and new programs were implemented during the first quarter of 2015.\nOn May 6, 2015, Indiana's governor signed Indiana Senate Bill 412 (Senate Bill 412) into law requiring electricity suppliers to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years. Senate Bill 412 also supports the recovery of all program costs, including lost revenues and financial incentives associated with those plans and approved by the IURC. The Company made its first filing pursuant to this bill in June 2015, which proposed energy efficiency programs for calendar years 2016 and 2017. In September 2015, the Company received an Order to continue offering and recovering the associated cost of its 2015 programs until March 31, 2016. In October 2015, the OUCC and Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana filed testimony recommending the rejection of the Company's plan, contending it was not reasonable under the terms of Senate Bill 412 due to the program design and the Company's proposal to recover lost revenues and incentives associated with the measures. Vectren filed rebuttal testimony in October 2015 defending the plan's compliance with Senate Bill 412. The Company expects an order in the first quarter of 2016.\nFERC Return on Equity (ROE) Complaints\nOn November 12, 2013, certain parties representing a group of industrial customers filed a joint complaint with the FERC under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act against the MISO and various MISO transmission owners, including SIGECO. The joint parties seek to reduce the 12.38 percent ROE used in the MISO transmission owners' rates, including SIGECO's formula transmission rates, to 9.15 percent, and to set a capital structure in which the equity component does not exceed 50 percent. A second customer complaint case was filed on February 11, 2015 as the maximum FERC-allowed refund period for the November 12, 2013 case ended February 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had invested approximately $157.7 million in qualifying projects. The net plant balance for these projects totaled $140.2 million at December 31, 2015.\nThese joint complaints are similar to a complaint against the New England Transmission Owners (NETO) filed in September 2011, which requested that the 11.14 percent incentive return granted on qualifying investments in NETO be lowered. On October 16, 2014, the FERC issued an Order in the NETO case approving a 10.57 percent return on equity and a calculation methodology.\nThe FERC acknowledged that the pending complaint raised against the MISO transmission owners is reasonable and denied the portion of the complaint addressing the equity component of the capital structure. An initial decision from its administrative law judge was received on December 22, 2015, authorizing the transmission owners to collect a Base ROE of 10.32 percent from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 (the first refund period\u201d). The FERC is expected to rule on the proposed order in late 2016. A procedural schedule has been established for the second customer complaint case, establishing a target date of June 30, 2016 for the initial decision.\nSeparately, on January 6, 2015, the FERC approved a MISO transmission owner joint request for an adder to the approved ROE. Under FERC regulations, transmission owners that are part of a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) such as the MISO are authorized to earn an incentive of 50 basis points above the FERC approved ROE. The FERC deferred the implementation of this adder until the pending complaint is resolved. Once the FERC sets a new ROE in the complaint case, this adder will be applied to that ROE, with retroactive billing to occur back to January 7, 2015.\nThe Company has established a reserve considering both the initial decision and the approved 50 basis points adder.\nWarrick Unit 4\nSIGECO and Alcoa Generating Corporation (AGC), a subsidiary of Alcoa, Inc. (Alcoa), own a 300 MW unit at the Warrick Power Plant (Warrick Unit 4) as tenants in common. SIGECO's proportionate cost of the unit is included in rate base. In January 2016, Alcoa announced plans to close its smelter operations by the end of the first quarter 2016. Historically, on-site generation owned and operated by AGC has been used to provide power to the smelter, as well as other mill operations, which will continue. Generation from Alcoa's share of the Warrick Unit 4 has historically been sold into the MISO market. The Company is actively working with Alcoa on plans related to continued operation of their generation, anticipating that more will be known toward the end of 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company's utility operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. These environmental regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities, and obligations in connection with the storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances and limit airborne emissions from electric generating facilities including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and mercury, among others. Environmental legislation and regulation also requires that facilities, sites, and other properties associated with the Company's operations be operated, maintained, abandoned, and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. The Company's current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to its results of operations and financial condition.\nWith the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, and more extensive permit requirements, the Company's investment in compliant infrastructure, and the associated operating costs have increased and are expected to increase in the future. Similar to the costs associated with federal mandates in the Pipeline Safety Law, Indiana Senate Bill 251 (Senate Bill 251) is also applicable to federal environmental mandates impacting SIGECO's electric operations.\nAir Quality\nMercury and Air Toxics (MATS) Rule\nOn December 21, 2011, the EPA finalized the utility MATS rule. The MATS rule sets emission limits for hazardous air pollutants for existing and new coal-fired power plants and identifies the following broad categories of hazardous air pollutants: mercury, non-mercury hazardous air pollutants (primarily arsenic, chromium, cobalt, and selenium), and acid gases (hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride). The rule imposes mercury emission limits for two sub-categories of coal and proposed surrogate limits for non-mercury and acid gas hazardous air pollutants.\nIn July 2014, a coalition of twenty-one states, including Indiana, filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the decision of the appellate court that found the EPA appropriately based its decision to list coal and oil fired generation units as a source of the pollutants at issue solely on those pollutants' impact on public health. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the appellate court decision on the basis of the EPA's failure to consider costs before determining whether it was appropriate and necessary to regulate steam electric generating units under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The Court did not vacate the rule, but remanded the MATS rule back to the appellate court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. MATS compliance was required to commence April 16, 2015, and the Company continues to operate in full compliance with the MATS rule. On December 15, 2015, the appellate court agreed to keep the current MATS rule in place while the agency completes the supplemental cost analysis ordered by the Court.\nNotice of Violation for A.B. Brown Power Plant\nThe Company received a NOV from the EPA in November 2011 pertaining to its A.B. Brown generating station. The NOV asserts when the facility was equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems, the correct permits were not obtained or the best available control technology to control incidental sulfuric acid mist was not installed. While the Company did not agree with notice, it reached a final settlement with the EPA to resolve the NOV in December 2015.\nAs noted previously, on January 28, 2015, the IURC issued an Order approving the Company's request for approval of capital investments on its coal-fired generation units to comply with new EPA mandates related to MATS effective in 2015 and to address the outstanding NOV regarding SO3 emissions from the EPA. The total investment is estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million, roughly half of which has been spent to control mercury in both air and water emissions, and the remaining investment has been made to address the issues raised in the NOV.\nIn March 2015, the Company was notified that certain parties had filed a Notice of Appeal with the Indiana Court of Appeals in response to the IURC's Order. In June 2015, Joint Appellants' Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc. (the appellants) filed a brief which challenged the sufficiency of the findings in the IURC's January Order approving the Company's investments and proposed accounting treatment in terms of whether that Order made certain findings required by statute. On October 29, 2015, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued its opinion affirming the IURC's findings with regard to equipment required to comply with MATS and certain national pollutant discharge elimination system rules (approximately $35 million). The Court remanded the case back to the IURC so that it can make the findings required by statute with regard to equipment required by the NOV (approximately $40 million). On February 12, 2016, the appellants filed a petition to reopen the evidentiary record in the case in order to submit additional evidence. The Company has opposed the motion and believes the IURC already has a sufficient record in this case. As it pertains to the equipment requirement required by the NOV, given the Commission's previous approval of this project, the Company believes the Commission will make these findings and issue a new order in support of the project.\nOzone NAAQS\nOn November 26, 2014, the EPA proposed to tighten the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) to a level with the range of 65 to 70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a new NAAQS for ozone at the high end of the range, or 70 ppb. The EPA is expected to make final determinations as to whether a region is in attainment for the new NAAQS in 2018 based upon monitoring data from 2014-2016. While it is possible that counties in southwest Indiana could be declared in non-attainment with the new standard, and thus could have an effect on future economic development activities in the Company's service territory, the Company does not anticipate any significant compliance cost impacts from the determination given its previous investment in SCR technology for NOx control on its units.\nOne Hour SO2 NAAQS\nOn February 16, 2016, the EPA notified states of the commencement of a 120 day consultation period between the state and the EPA with respect to the EPA's recommendations for new non-attainment designations for the 2010 One Hour SO2 NAAQS. Identified on the list was Posey County, Indiana, in which the Company's A.B. Brown Generating Station is located. While the Company is in compliance with all applicable SO2 limits in its permits, the Company is currently working with the state of Indiana on voluntary measures that the Company may take without significant incremental costs to ensure that Posey County remains in attainment with the 2010 One Hour SO2 NAAQS. The Company's coal-fired generating fleet is 100 percent scrubbed for SO2 and 90 percent controlled for NOx.\nCoal Ash Waste Disposal, Ash Ponds and Water\nCoal Combustion Residuals Rule\nIn December 2014, the EPA released its final Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) rule which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). On April 17, 2015, the final rule was published in the Federal Register. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash and the Company will continue to reuse a majority of its ash. Legislation is currently being considered by Congress that would provide for enforcement of the federal program by states rather than through citizen suits. Additionally, the CCR rule is currently being challenged by multiple parties in judicial review proceedings. Opening briefs were filed by those parties in December of 2015, with full briefing not expected to be complete until May 2016.\nUnder the final CCR rule, the Company is required to complete a series of integrity assessments, including seismic modeling given the Company's facilities are located within two seismic zones, and groundwater monitoring studies to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place, with bottom ash handling conversions completed. In late 2015, the Company prepared preliminary cost estimates to retire the ash ponds at the end of their useful lives based on interpretation of the available closure alternatives contemplated in the final rule that ranged from approximately $35 million to $80 million. These estimates contemplated final capping and monitoring costs of the ponds at both F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. At this time the Company does not believe that these rules are applicable to its Warrick generating unit, as this unit is part of a larger generating station that predominantly serves an adjacent industrial facility. The Company continues to refine the assumptions, engineering analyses and resulting cost estimates. Further analysis and the refinement of assumptions may result in estimated costs that could be significantly in excess of the current range of $35 million to $80 million.\nAt September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an approximate $25 million asset retirement obligation (ARO). The recorded ARO reflected the present value of the approximate $35 million in estimated costs in the range above. These assumptions and estimations are subject to change in the future and could materially impact the amount of the estimated ARO.\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs)\nUnder the Clean Water Act, the EPA sets technology-based guidelines for water discharges from new and existing facilities. On September 30, 2015, the EPA released final revisions to the existing steam electric ELGs setting stringent technology-based water discharge limits for the electric power industry. The EPA focused this rulemaking on wastewater generated primarily by pollution control equipment necessitated by the comprehensive air regulations, specifically setting strict water discharge limits for arsenic, mercury and selenium for scrubber waste waters. The ELGs will be implemented when existing water discharge permits for the plants are renewed, with compliance activities expected to commence within the 2018-2023 time frame. Current wastewater discharge permits for the Brown and Culley power plants expire in October and December 2016, respectively. The Company is working with the State on permit renewals which will include a compliance schedule for ELGs. In no event will compliance with the ELGs be required prior to November 2018. The ELGs work in tandem with the recently released CCR requirements, effectively prohibiting the use of less costly lined sediment basin options for disposal of coal combustion residuals, and virtually mandate conversions to dry bottom ash handling.\nCooling Water Intake Structures\nSection 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that generating facilities use the best technology available\u201d (BTA) to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water. More specifically, Section 316(b) is concerned with impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in once-through cooling water intake structures used at electric generating facilities. A final rule was issued by the EPA on May 19, 2014. The final rule does not mandate cooling water tower retrofits but requires a state level case-by-case assessment of BTA for each facility. The final rule lists seven presumptive technologies which would qualify as BTA. These technologies range from intake screen modifications to cooling water tower retrofits. Ecological and technology assessment studies must be completed prior to determining BTA for the Company's facilities. To comply, the Company believes that capital investments will likely be in the range of $4 million to $8 million.\nClimate Change\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of Vectren, Utility Holdings is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts, and if a national climate change policy is implemented, believes it should have the following elements:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases, and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to baseload generation including effective energy conservation, demand side management, and generation efficiency measures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inclusion of incentives for research and development and investment in advanced clean coal technology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and continued increase in the domestic supply of natural gas and oil to reduce dependence on foreign oil.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on data made available through the Electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GRRT) maintained by the EPA, the Company's direct CO2 emissions from its fossil fuel electric generation that report under the Acid Rain Program were less than one half of one percent of all emissions in the United States from similar sources. Emissions from other Company operations, including those from its natural gas distribution operations and the greenhouse gas emissions the Company is required to report on behalf of its end use customers, are similarly available through the EPA's e-GRRT database and reporting tool.\nCurrent Initiatives to Increase Conservation & Reduce Emissions\nThe Company is committed to a policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy usage. Evidence of this commitment includes:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Focusing the Company's mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs.

This results in a final emission rate goal for Indiana of 1,242 lb CO2/MWh to be achieved by 2030. The new rule gives states the option of seeking a two-year extension from the deadline of September 2016 to submit a final state implementation plan (SIP). Under the CPP, states have the flexibility to include energy efficiency and other measures should it choose to implement a SIP as provided in the final rule. While states are given an interim goal (1,451 lb CO2/MWh for Indiana), the final rule gives states the flexibility to shape their own emissions reduction over the 2022-2029 time period. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015 and that action was immediately followed by litigation initiated by the State of Indiana and 23 other states as a coalition challenging the rule. In January of 2016, the reviewing court denied the states' and other parties requests to stay the implementation of the CPP pending completion of judicial review. On January 26, 2016, 29 states and state agencies (including the 24 state coalition referenced above) filed a request for immediate stay with the U.S. Supreme Court. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay to delay the regulation while being challenged in court. The stay will remain in place while the lower court concludes its review, with oral arguments to be heard in June 2016 under the existing accelerated schedule. Among other things, the stay is anticipated to delay the requirement to submit a final SIP by the September 2016 deadline. Apart from the delay, the Court's action creates additional uncertainty as to the future of the rule and presents further challenges as the Company proceeds with its integrated resource planning process later this year.\nIn the event that a state does not submit a SIP, the EPA also released a proposed federal implementation plan (FIP), which would be imposed on those states without an approved SIP. The proposed FIP would apply an emission rate requirement directly on generating units. Under the proposed FIP, the CO2 emission rate limit for coal-fired units would start at 1,671 lbs CO2/MWh in 2022 and decrease to a final emission rate cap of 1,305 lbs CO2/MWh by 2030. While the FIP emission rate cap appears to be slightly less stringent than the state reduction goal for Indiana, the cap would apply directly to generating units and these units would not have the benefit of averaging emission rates with rates from zero-carbon sources as would be available in a SIP. Purchases of emission credits from zero-carbon sources can be made for compliance. The FIP will be subject to extensive public comments prior to finalization. Whether the State of Indiana will file a SIP has yet to be finally\ndetermined. Pending that determination, the electric utilities in Indiana are working with the state's designated agency to analyze various compliance options for consideration and possible integration into a state plan submittal.\nIndiana is the 5th largest carbon emitter in the nation in tons of CO2 produced from electric generation. In 2013, Indiana's electric utilities generated 105.6 million tons of CO2. The Company's share of that total was 6.3 million, or less than 6 percent. From 2005 to 2014, the Company's emissions of CO2 have declined 27 percent (on a tonnage basis). These reductions have come from the retirement of F.B. Culley Unit 1, expiration of municipal contracts, electric conservation, the addition of renewable generation, and the installation of more efficient dense pack turbine technology. With respect to renewable generation, in 2008 and 2009, the Company executed long-term purchase power commitments for a total of 80 MW of wind energy. The Company currently has approximately 4 percent of its electricity being provided by clean energy sources due to the long-term wind contracts and landfill gas investment. See further details on these clean energy sources in Item 1. With respect to CO2 emission rate, since 2005 the Company has lowered its CO2 emission rate (as measured in lbs CO2/MWh) from 1,967 lbs CO2/MWh to 1,922 lbs CO2/MWh, for a reduction of 3 percent. The Company's CO2 emission rate of 1,922 lbs CO2/MWh is basically the same as the State's average CO2 emission rate of 1,923 lbs CO2/MWh. The Company plans to consider these reductions in CO2 emissions and renewable generation when working with the state to develop a possible state implementation plan.\nImpact of Legislative Actions & Other Initiatives is Unknown\nAt this time, compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in GHG emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. The Company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to control GHG emissions. A preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant, first with regard to operating expenses and later for capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control GHG emissions. However, these compliance cost estimates were based on highly uncertain assumptions, including allowance prices if a cap and trade approach were employed, and energy efficiency targets. The Company is undertaking a detailed review of the requirements of the CPP and the proposed FIP and a review of potential compliance options. The Company will also continue to remain engaged with the State of Indiana to assess the final rule and to develop a plan that is the least cost to its customers.\nWhile the Company cannot reasonably estimate the total cost to comply with the CCR, ELG and CPP regulations at this time, the Company is exploring various compliance options ranging from continued compliance to retirement of units. The cost of compliance with these new regulations could be significant. The Company believes that such compliance costs would be considered a federally mandated cost of providing electricity, and therefore, should be recoverable from customers through Senate Bill 251 as referenced above, Senate Bill 29, which was used by the Company to recover its initial pollution control investments, or through other forms of rate recovery. These compliance alternatives, including the impact on customer rates, will be fully considered as part of the Company's public integrated resource planning process to be conducted in 2016.\nManufactured Gas Plants\nIn the past, the Company operated facilities to manufacture natural gas. Given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines, these facilities have not been operated for many years. Under current environmental laws and regulations, those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds.\nIn the Indiana Gas service territory, the existence, location, and certain general characteristics of 26 gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which the Company may have some remedial responsibility. A remedial investigation/ feasibility study (RI/FS) was completed at one of the sites under an agreed upon order between Indiana Gas and the IDEM, and a Record of Decision was issued by the IDEM in January 2000. The remaining sites have been submitted to the IDEM's Voluntary Remediation Program (VRP). The Company has identified its involvement in five manufactured gas plant sites in SIGECO's service territory, all of which are currently enrolled in the IDEM's VRP. The Company is currently conducting some level of remedial activities, including groundwater monitoring at certain sites.\nThe Company has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation, remediation, groundwater monitoring, and related costs for the sites. While the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time, the Company has recorded cumulative costs that it has incurred or reasonably expects to incur totaling\napproximately $43.4 million ($23.2 million at Indiana Gas and $20.2 million at SIGECO). The estimated accrued costs are limited to the Company's share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other potentially responsible parties (PRP).\nWith respect to insurance coverage, Indiana Gas has received approximately $20.8 million from all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation. Likewise, SIGECO has settlement agreements with all known insurance carriers and has received to date approximately $14.8 million of the expected $15.8 million in insurance recoveries.\nThe costs the Company expects to incur are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred, the timing of expected future payments, and inflation factors, among others. While the Company's utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites, it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to PRP or insurance recovery. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $3.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of accrued, but not yet spent, costs are included in Other Liabilities related to the Indiana Gas and SIGECO sites.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRevenue Recognition Guidance\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in this guidance state that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This new guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.\nOn July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral that became effective through an Accounting Standard Update in August and changed the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine application date, transition method, and impact the standard will have on the financial statements.\nFinancial Reporting of Discontinued Operations\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of a company or entity. The guidance changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and provides for enhanced disclosures in this area. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results. Additionally, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures to provide more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2015. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's financial statements.\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on accounting for debt issuance costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. This ASU requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. Upon adoption, the Company will revise its current presentation of debt issuance costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, the Company does not expect a material impact on its future financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of the adoption.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with related valuation allowances, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This guidance was early adopted for the year ended December 31, 2015, and has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The effect of this change on the December 31, 2015 and 2014 balance sheets is the reclassification of $13.2 million and $11.2 million in current deferred tax assets to long-term deferred tax liabilities, respectively. The amounts reclassified primarily represent the net of deferred tax assets arising from alternative minimum tax carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities arising from deferred fuels costs.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements. This ASU requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases while also refining the definition of a lease. In addition, lessees will be required to disclose key information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019, although it can be early adopted, with a modified retrospective approach for leases that commenced prior to the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact it will have on the financial statements.\nManagement believes that other recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement is required to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The footnotes to the consolidated financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in their preparation. Certain estimates are subjective and use variables that require judgment. These include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to allocate Vectren's support services, assets, and its pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The Company makes other estimates related to the effects of regulation that are critical to the Company's financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes. Other estimates that significantly affect the Company's results, but are not necessarily critical to operations, include depreciating utility and nonutility plant, valuing asset retirement obligations, and estimating uncollectible accounts, unbilled revenues, and deferred income taxes, among others. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill, most of which resides in the Gas Utility Services operating segment, at the beginning of each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has determined its Gas Utility Services operating segment to be the level at which impairment is tested as its reporting units are similar. An impairment test requires fair value be estimated. The Company used a discounted cash flow model and other market based information to estimate the fair value of its Gas Utility Services operating segment, and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimated fair value has been substantially in excess of the carrying amount in each of the last three years and therefore resulted in no impairment.\nEstimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate, growth assumptions, company expense allocations, and longevity of cash flows. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the Gas Utility Services segment's fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge.\nIntercompany Allocations\nSupport Services\nVectren provides corporate, general, and administrative services to the Company and allocates costs to the Company, including costs for share-based compensation and for pension and other postretirement benefits that are not directly charged to subsidiaries. These costs have been allocated using various allocators, including number of employees, number of customers, and/or the level of payroll, revenue contribution, and capital expenditures. Allocations are at cost. Management believes that the allocation methodology is reasonable and approximates the costs that would have been incurred had the Company secured those services on a stand-alone basis. The allocation methodology is not subject to near term changes.\nPension and Other Postretirement Obligations\nVectren satisfies the future funding requirements of its pension and other postretirement plans and the payment of benefits from general corporate assets and, as necessary, relies on Utility Holdings to support the funding of these obligations. However, Utility Holdings has no contractual funding commitment. Vectren allocates the periodic cost of its retirement plans calculated pursuant to US GAAP to its subsidiaries. Periodic cost, comprised of service cost and interest on that service cost, is directly charged to Utility Holdings based on labor at each measurement date and that cost is charged to operating expense and capital projects, using labor charges as the allocation method. Other components of periodic costs (such as interest cost, asset returns, and amortizations) and the service cost related to Vectren Corporate operations are charged to subsidiaries through the allocation process discussed above. Any difference between funding requirements and allocated periodic costs is recognized as an asset or liability until reflected in periodic costs. Neither plan assets nor the ending liability is allocated to individual subsidiaries since these assets and obligations are derived from corporate level decisions. Management believes these direct charges when combined with benefit-related corporate charges discussed in support services\u201d above approximate costs that would have been incurred if the Company accounted for benefit plans on a stand-alone basis.\nVectren estimates the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, rate of compensation increase, and future health care costs, among other inputs, and obtains actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of pension and postretirement plans. Vectren used the following weighted average assumptions to develop 2015 periodic benefit cost: a discount rate of approximately 4.05 percent, an expected return on plan assets of 7.50 percent, a rate of compensation increase of 3.50 percent, and an inflation assumption of 2.50 percent. Due to lower interest rates, the discount rate is approximately 70 basis points lower from the assumption used in 2014. Inflation rates, expected return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increase remained the same from 2014 to 2015. To estimate 2016 costs, the following weighted average assumptions were used: a discount rate of approximately 4.31 percent; an expected return on plan assets of 7.50 percent; a rate of compensation increase of 3.50 percent; and an inflation assumption of 2.50 percent.\nIn October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) released updated mortality estimates that reflect increased life expectancy. Management updated its mortality assumptions at December 31, 2014 to incorporate this increase in life expectancy. Accordingly, management updated its base mortality assumption to the SOA 2014 table as well as updated its projected mortality improvement. In October 2015, the SOA released updated projected mortality improvement that reflect additional years of data. Management continues to use the SOA 2014 base table, but has updated projected mortality improvement to reflect inclusion of the additional data released in 2015. Future changes in health care costs, work force demographics, interest rates, asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits. Vectren's management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately $5.5 million in 2016, compared to approximately $10 million in 2015, $9 million in 2014, and $14 million in 2013.\nVectren's management estimates that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate used to estimate retirement costs generally decreases periodic benefit cost by approximately $2.0 million.\nRegulation\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates. This review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in FASB guidance related to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. Based on the Company's current review, it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery. If all or part of the Company's operations cease to meet the criteria, a write-off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required. In addition, the Company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities. In the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment, such write-offs and impairment charges could be significant.\nFinancial Condition\nUtility Holdings funds the short-term and long-term financing needs of its utility subsidiary operations. Vectren does not guarantee Utility Holdings' debt. Utility Holdings' outstanding long-term and short-term borrowing arrangements are jointly and severally guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas, and VEDO. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several, and Utility Holdings has no subsidiaries other than the subsidiary guarantors. Information about the subsidiary guarantors as a group is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Utility Holdings' long-term debt and short-term obligations outstanding at December 31, 2015 approximated $1 billion and $15 million, respectively. Additionally, prior to Utility Holdings' formation, Indiana Gas and SIGECO funded their operations separately, and therefore, have long-term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations. SIGECO will also occasionally issue tax exempt debt to fund qualifying pollution control capital expenditures. Total Indiana Gas and SIGECO long-term debt, including current maturities, outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $401 million.\nUtility Holdings' operations have historically been the primary source for Vectren's common stock dividends.\nThe credit ratings of the senior unsecured debt of Utility Holdings and Indiana Gas, at December 31, 2015, are A-/A2 as rated by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services (Standard and Poor's) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), respectively. The credit ratings on SIGECO's secured debt are A/Aa3. Utility Holdings' commercial paper has a credit rating of A-2/P-1. The current outlook of both Moody's and Standard and Poor's is stable. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Standard and Poor's and Moody's lowest level investment grade rating is BBB- and Baa3, respectively.\nThe Company's consolidated equity capitalization objective is 50-60 percent of long-term capitalization. This objective may have varied, and will vary, depending on particular business opportunities, capital spending requirements, execution of long-term financing plans, and seasonal factors that affect the Company's operations. The Company's equity component was 52 percent and 54 percent of long-term capitalization at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Long-term capitalization includes long-term debt, including current maturities, as well as common shareholders' equity.\nBoth long-term and short-term borrowing arrangements contain customary default provisions; restrictions on liens, sale-leaseback transactions, mergers or consolidations, and sales of assets; and restrictions on leverage, among other restrictions. Multiple debt agreements contain a covenant that the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization will not exceed 65 percent. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nAvailable Liquidity\nThe Company's A-/A2 investment grade credit ratings have allowed it to access the capital markets as needed, and as evidenced by past financing transactions, the Company believes it will have the ability to continue to do so. The Company anticipates funding future capital expenditures and dividends principally through internally generated funds, supplemented with incremental external debt financing. However, the resources required for capital investment remain uncertain for a variety of factors including, but not limited to, expanded environmental regulations on power generation and regulatory initiatives involving gas pipeline infrastructure replacement. These regulations may result in the need to raise additional capital in the coming years.\nThe Company routinely seeks approval at the IURC and the PUCO for long-term financing authority at the individual utility level. This authority provides for the flexibility for each utility to issue its own debt and equity securities to third parties or to issue its debt and equity securities to the Company and thus receive some of the proceeds from various Company issuances to third parties on the same terms as those obtained by the Company. It is expected that the majority of the long-term debt needs of the utilities will be met through these debt issuances by the Company, some or all of which are then reloaned to the individual utilities. The most recent financing Orders for SIGECO and IGC were received on March 4, 2015 and for VEDO on March 11, 2015. As the VEDO Order expires March 31, 2016, the Company is currently pursuing a new order for long-term financing authority from the PUCO and a final order is expected in the first half of 2016. Orders for SIGECO and IGC expire in December 2016.\nRecent Company financings are explained beginning on page 42.\nConsolidated Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $350 million of short-term borrowing capacity. As reduced by borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2015, approximately $335 million was available. This short-term credit facility was amended on October 31, 2014 to extend its maturity until October 2019. The maximum limit of the facility remained unchanged. This facility is used to supplement working capital needs and also to fund capital investments and debt redemptions until financed on a long-term basis.\nThe Company has historically funded the short-term borrowing needs through the commercial paper market and expects to use the short-term borrowing facility in instances where the commercial paper market is not efficient. Following is certain information regarding these short-term borrowing arrangements.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Month End Balance Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThroughout the years presented, Utility Holdings has successfully placed commercial paper as needed.\nProceeds from Stock Plans\nVectren may periodically issue new common shares to satisfy dividend reinvestment plan and other employee benefit plan requirements and contribute those proceeds to Utility Holdings. New issuances in 2015, 2014, and 2013 contributed to Utility Holdings added additional liquidity of $6.2 million, $6.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively.\nPotential Uses of Liquidity\nPlanned Capital Expenditures\nDuring 2015, capital expenditures approximated $400 million, compared to $350 million in 2014 and $260 million in 2013. Planned capital expenditures, including contractual purchase commitments, for the five-year period 2016 - 2020 are expected to total approximately (in millions): $480, $460, $430, $445, and $415, respectively. This plan contains the best estimate of the resources required for known regulatory compliance; however, many environmental and pipeline safety standards are subject to change in the near term. Such changes could materially impact planned capital expenditures.\nPension and Postretirement Funding Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, Vectren's assets related to its qualified pension plans were approximately 90 percent of the projected benefit obligation on a GAAP basis and 122 percent of the target liability for ERISA purposes. A contribution of $15 million was made to the qualified pension plans in 2016. Utility Holdings has funded this contribution.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of contractual obligations at December 31, 2015:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,400.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,187.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt interest commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>772.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,507.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,962.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The debt due in 2016 is comprised of debt issued by SIGECO\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The Company has other long-term liabilities that total approximately $136 million. This amount is comprised of the following: allocated portions of Vectren's deferred compensation and share-based compensation $36 million, asset retirement obligations $82 million, allocated portions of Vectren's postretirement obligations totaling $12 million, investment tax credits $2 million, environmental remediation $3 million, and other obligations totaling $1 million. Based on the nature of these items their expected settlement dates cannot be estimated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's regulated utilities have both firm and non-firm commitments to purchase natural gas, coal, and electricity as well as certain transportation and storage rights. Costs arising from these commitments, while significant, are pass-through costs, generally collected dollar-for-dollar from retail customers through regulator-approved cost recovery mechanisms. Because of the pass through nature of these costs, they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations.\nComparison of Historical Sources & Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Cash Flow\nThe Company's primary source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations, which totaled $492.9 million in 2015, compared to $337.5 million in 2014 and $399.9 million in 2013. The $155.4 million increase in operating cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily driven by weather related impacts on working capital and reduced tax payments. Weather related impacts include the fluctuation in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues, recoverable/refundable fuel and natural gas costs and prepaid gas costs. The decrease in tax payments in 2015 reflects the full impact of bonus depreciation. Additionally, in 2015, there was a decrease in prepaid taxes due to the timing of a federal refund received related to the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2014. These increases are offset somewhat by an increase in contributions to qualified pension plans in 2015 and growth in in regulatory assets related to increased spend on infrastructure programs.\nIn 2014, operating cash flows decreased $62.4 million compared to 2013. This decrease was primarily due to higher coal inventory levels at December 31, 2014, primarily driven by weather variations during the year.\nTax payments in the periods presented were favorably impacted by federal legislation extending bonus depreciation. Federal legislation allowing bonus depreciation on qualifying capital expenditures was 50 percent for each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013. A significant portion of the Company's capital expenditures qualified for this bonus treatment.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $104.8 million while cash flow from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was an inflow of $23.9 million and an outflow of $142.9 million, respectively. Financing activity reflects the Company's utilization of the long-term capital markets in the current low interest rate environment. During the periods presented, financing activities reflect the issuance of debt for the purposes of refinancing\nmaturing debt and paying down short term borrowings. The Company's operating cash flow funded 97 percent of capital expenditures and dividends in 2015, 73 percent of capital expenditures and dividends in 2014, and over 100 percent of capital expenditures and dividends 2013. Recently completed long-term financing transactions are more fully described below.\nIndiana Gas Unsecured Note Retirement\nOn March 15, 2015, a $5 million Indiana Gas senior unsecured note matured. The Series E note carried a fixed interest rate of 7.15 percent. The repayment of debt was funded by the Company's commercial paper program.\nSIGECO Debt Issuance\nOn September 9, 2015, SIGECO completed a $38.2 million tax-exempt first mortgage bond issuance. The principal terms of the two new series of tax-exempt debt are: (i) $23.0 million in Environmental Improvement Revenue Bonds, Series 2015, issued by the City of Mount Vernon, Indiana and (ii) $15.2 million in Environmental Improvement Revenue Bonds, Series 2015, issued by Warrick County, Indiana.

Proceeds from the issuance were used to retire three series of tax-exempt bonds aggregating $63.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued interest. The principal terms of the two new series of tax-exempt debt are: (i) $22.3 million sold in a public offering and bear interest at 4.00 percent per annum, due September 1, 2044 and (ii) $41.3 million, due July 1, 2025, sold in a private placement at variable rates through September 2019.\nSIGECO 2013 Debt Refund and Reissuance\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, approximately $111 million of SIGECO's tax-exempt long-term debt was redeemed at par plus accrued interest. Approximately $62 million of tax-exempt long-term debt was reissued on April 26, 2013 at interest rates that are fixed to maturity, receiving proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $60 million. The terms are $22.2 million at 4.00 percent per annum due in 2038, and $39.6 million at 4.05 percent per annum due in 2043.\nThe remaining approximately $49 million of the called debt was remarketed on August 13, 2013. The remarketed tax-exempt debt has a fixed interest rate of 1.95 percent per annum until September 13, 2017. SIGECO closed on this remarketing and received net proceeds of $48.3 million on August 28, 2013.\nUtility Holdings 2013 Debt Call and Reissuance\nOn April 1, 2013, VUHI exercised a call option at par on $121.6 million 6.25 percent senior unsecured notes due in 2039. This debt was refinanced on June 5, 2013, with proceeds from a private placement note purchase agreement entered into on December 20, 2012 with a delayed draw feature. It provides for the following tranches of notes: (i) $45 million, 3.20 percent senior guaranteed notes, due June 5, 2028 and (ii) $80 million, 4.25 percent senior guaranteed notes, due June 5, 2043. Total proceeds received from these notes, net of issuance costs, were $44.8 million and $79.6 million, respectively. The notes are unconditionally guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas, and VEDO.\nOn August 22, 2013, VUHI entered into a private placement note purchase agreement with a delayed draw feature, pursuant to which institutional investors agreed to purchase $150 million of senior guaranteed notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.72 percent per annum, due December 5, 2023. The notes were unconditionally guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas, and VEDO. On December 5, 2013, the Company received net proceeds of $149.1 million from the issuance of the senior guaranteed notes, which were used to refinance $100 million of 5.25 percent senior notes that matured August 1, 2013, for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.\nMandatory Tenders\nAt December 31, 2015, certain series of SIGECO bonds, aggregating $87.3 million, currently bear interest at fixed rates, of which $49.1 million is subject to mandatory tender in September 2017 and $38.2 million is subject to mandatory tender in September 2020. Additionally, SIGECO Bond Series 2014B, in the amount of $41.3 million, with a variable interest rate that is reset monthly, is subject to mandatory tender in September 2019.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash flow required for investing activities was $401.2 million in 2015, $350.7 million in 2014, and $261.7 million in 2013. The primary use of cash in all years reflects expenditures for utility plant. The increase in Utility Holdings' capital expenditures in 2015 over 2014 is attributable to greater expenditures for gas infrastructure improvement projects and environmental compliance.\nForward-Looking Information\nA safe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements is provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act of 1995).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nUtility Holdings generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers. Utility Holdings' primary source of cash flow results from the collection of customer bills and payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services. Utility Holdings segregates its utility operations between a Gas Utility Services operating segment and an Electric Utility Services operating segment.\nVectren has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management. The committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of Utility Holdings' SEC filings.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nExecutive Summary of Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring 2015, Utility Holdings earned $160.9 million, compared to $148.4 million in 2014 and $141.8 million in 2013. The improved results in 2015 compared to 2014 are largely driven by returns earned on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs, offset somewhat by a decrease in electric margin primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather in the fourth quarter of 2014. Decreases in operating expenses related to performance-based compensation and the timing of power plant maintenance costs also favorably impacted earnings, as did increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Results in 2014 compared to 2013 reflect increased gas and electric margins. However, these increased margins were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in performance-based compensation expense and gas system maintenance resulting from the harsh winter in the first part of 2014.\nGas utility services\nThe gas utility segment earned $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $57.0 million in 2014 and $55.7 million in 2013. The improved results in the periods presented are primarily due to increased returns on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs as the investment in those programs continues to increase. Increased earnings in 2015 also resulted from growth in small customer count and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense. These increases were somewhat offset by the unfavorable impacts of weather on the Company's Ohio business in 2015. The increased margin in 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by higher operating expenses from increased performance-based compensation expense and increased weather-related maintenance of the gas system during the first half of 2014.\nElectric utility services\nThe electric operations earned $82.6 million during 2015, compared to $79.7 million in 2014 and $75.8 million in 2013. Results in 2014 reflected the favorable impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimated the after tax impact to be approximately $2.2 million compared to 2015. Lower wholesale margin due primarily to lower market pricing also reduced 2015 results when compared to 2014. Lower operating expenses in 2015 driven primarily by decreases in power plant maintenance costs and performance-based compensation, favorably impacted 2015 results. Improved 2014 results compared to 2013 were due primarily to the impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimates the after tax impact to be approximately $1.1 million favorable compared to 2013 as well as an increase in lost revenue recovery margin related to electric conservation programs, which had an after tax favorable impact of $2.3 million. These improved results were offset somewhat by higher operating costs, including higher performance-based compensation and the acceleration of power supply maintenance projects completed in 2014.\nOther utility operations\nIn 2015, earnings from other utility operations were $13.9 million, compared to $11.7 million in 2014 and $10.3 million in 2013. An increase in earnings was driven by a lower effective income tax rate in 2015, from increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Approximately $3.5 million of this increase was related to research\nand development tax credits for prior periods as the Internal Revenue Service recently issued guidance that provided clarifications of internal-use software that qualifies for the credit. The revaluation of deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels and the rate reduction from a change in the Indiana tax legislation passed in 2014, resulted in higher earnings in 2014 compared to 2013.\nThe Regulatory Environment\nGas and electric operations are regulated by the IURC, with regard to retail rates and charges, terms of service, accounting matters, financing, and certain other operational matters specific to its Indiana customers (the operations of SIGECO and Indiana Gas). The retail gas operations of VEDO are subject to regulation by the PUCO.\nIn the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. Similar usage risks in Ohio are diminished by a straight fixed variable rate design for the Company's residential customers. In addition to these mechanisms, the commissions have authorized gas infrastructure replacement programs in all natural gas service territories, which allow for recovery of these investments outside of a base rate case proceeding. Further, rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment (GCA) clause and electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause (FAC). Both of these cost tracker mechanisms allow for the timely adjustment in charges to reflect changes in the cost of gas and cost for fuel. The Company utilizes similar mechanisms for other material operating costs, which allow for changes in revenue outside of a base rate case. Primarily as a result of rate mechanisms, the Company's last increase in base rates was 2011 for its electric business and 2009 for its gas business.\nRate Design Strategies\nSales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather. Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as the Company's utilities have implemented conservation programs. In the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. The Ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers. This rate design, which was fully implemented in February 2010, mitigates approximately 90 percent of the Ohio service territory's weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small customer classes.\nIn all natural gas service territories, the commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs. In Indiana, state laws were passed in 2012 and 2013 that expand the ability of utilities to recover, outside of a base rate proceeding, certain costs of federally mandated projects and other significant gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments. Legislation was passed in 2011 in Ohio that support the investment in other capital projects, allowing the utility to defer the impacts of these investments until its next base rate case. The Company has received approval to implement these mechanisms in both states.\nSIGECO's electric service territory currently recovers certain transmission investments outside of base rates. The electric service territory has neither an NTA nor a decoupling mechanism; however, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives.\nTracked Operating Expenses\nGas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve Indiana customers are two of the Company's most significant operating expenses. Rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment clause. The GCA clause allows the Company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas, inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on actual experience and subject to caps that are based on historical experience. Electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel. The net energy cost of purchased power, subject to an approved variable benchmark based on The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices, is also timely recovered through the FAC.\nGCA and FAC procedures involve periodic filings and IURC hearings to establish price adjustments for a designated future period. The procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the\nestimated costs and actual costs incurred. Since April 2010, the Company has not been the supplier of natural gas in its Ohio territory.\nThe IURC has also applied the statute authorizing GCA and FAC procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test. In the periods presented, the Company has not been impacted by the earnings test.\nIn Indiana, gas pipeline integrity management operating costs, costs to fund energy efficiency programs, MISO costs, and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery. In addition, certain operating costs, including depreciation associated with federally mandated investments, gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments, and regional electric transmission assets not in base rates are also recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery.\nIn Ohio, expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense, costs associated with exiting the merchant function, and costs associated with the infrastructure replacement program and other gas distribution capital expenditures are subject to recovery outside of base rates.\nRevenues and margins in both states are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes, which primarily fluctuate with gas and fuel costs.\nBase Rate Orders\nOver the last eight years, regulatory orders establishing new base rates have been received by each utility. SIGECO's electric territory received an order in April 2011, with rates effective May 2011, and its gas territory received an order and implemented rates in August 2007. Indiana Gas received its most recent base rate order and implemented rates in February 2008, and VEDO received an order in January 2009, with implementation in February 2009. The orders authorize a return on equity ranging from 10.15 percent to 10.40 percent. The authorized returns reflect the impact of rate design strategies that have been authorized by these state commissions.\nSee the Rate and Regulatory Matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the Company's utilities over the last three years.\nOperating Trends\nMargin\nThroughout this discussion, the terms Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin are used. Gas utility margin is calculated as Gas utility revenues less the Cost of gas sold. Electric utility margin is calculated as Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power. The Company believes Gas utility and Electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and these are generally collected on a dollar-for-dollar basis from customers.\nIn addition, the Company separately reflects regulatory expense recovery mechanisms within Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin. These amounts represent dollar-for-dollar recovery of other operating expenses. The Company utilizes these approved regulatory mechanisms to recover variations in operating expenses from the amounts reflected in base rates and are generally expenses that are subject to volatility. Following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations.\nGas utility margin\nGas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows:\n\nGas utility margins were $487.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and compared to 2014, increased $11.3 million. Margin increased from returns on infrastructure replacement programs in Indiana and Ohio of $14.1 million compared to 2014. Customer margin also increased $1.5 million compared to 2014 from small customer growth. With rate designs that substantially limit the impact of weather on margin, heating degree days that were 95 percent of normal in Ohio and 88 percent of normal in Indiana during 2015, compared to 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, had only a slight unfavorable impact on small customer margin. However, warmer weather did decrease sold and transported volumes, resulting in lower regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding decrease in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin decreased $2.4 million compared to 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gas utility margins increased $24.0 million compared to 2013. Heating degree days that were 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, compared to 103 percent of normal in Ohio and 102 percent of normal in Indiana during 2013, had a slight favorable impact on small customer margin. Colder weather increased sold and transported volumes, which was the primary driver in the higher regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding increase in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin increased $15.0 million compared to 2013. Customer margin increased $3.8 million compared to 2013 from small customer growth and large customer usage. Additionally, margin was favorably impacted by $3.5 million from the return from infrastructure replacement programs, particularly in Ohio in 2014 compared to 2013.\nElectric utility margin (Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power)\nElectric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows:\n\nRetail\nElectric retail utility margins were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, compared to 2014, decreased by $6.7 million. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, reflect a $3.6 million decrease from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 88 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 107 percent of normal in 2014. While cooling degree days were 111 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 104 percent of normal in 2014, the increase in margin resulting from the increase in cooling degree days only partially offset the large decrease caused by the warmer winter in 2015. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $0.7 million compared to the prior year. Results also reflect a decrease in large customer usage of $1.5 million largely driven by timing of customer plant maintenance resulting in lower customer throughput. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms decreased $2.0 million as operating expenses associated with the electric conservation programs decreased.\nIn 2014, Electric retail utility margins were $389.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and, compared to 2013, increased by $9.3 million. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $3.9 million compared to 2013. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, experienced a $1.8 million increase from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 107 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 102 percent of normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 104 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 103 percent of normal in 2013. Results also reflect increased large customer usage, which had a favorable margin impact of $2.0 million. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms increased $1.1 million driven primarily by a corresponding increase in operating expenses associated with MISO costs.\nOn December 3, 2013, SABIC Innovative Plastics (SABIC), a large industrial utility customer of the Company, announced its plans to build a cogeneration (cogen) facility to be operational at the end of 2016 or early in 2017, in order to generate power to meet a significant portion of its ongoing power needs. Electric service is currently provided to SABIC by the Company under a long-term contract that expires in May of 2016. SABIC's historical peak electric usage has been approximately 120 megawatts (MW). The cogen facility is expected to provide approximately 80 MW of capacity. Therefore, the Company will continue to provide all of SABIC's power requirements above the approximate 80 MW capacity of the cogen, which is projected to be approximately 40 MW. The Company will also provide back-up power, when required.\nMargin from Wholesale Electric Activities\nThe Company earns a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the Company in its service territory that meet the criteria of the MISO's regional transmission expansion plans and also markets and sells its generating and transmission capacity\nto optimize the return on its owned assets. Substantially all off-system sales are generated in the MISO Day Ahead and Real Time markets when sales into the MISO in a given hour are greater than amounts purchased for native load. Further detail of MISO off-system margin and transmission system margin follows:\n\nTransmission system margin associated with qualifying projects, including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms, and other transmission system operations, totaled $25.5 million during 2015, compared to $26.1 million in 2014 and $29.4 million in 2013. Results in 2015 and 2014 reflect lower returns on transmission investments associated with pending FERC ROE complaints. To date, the Company has invested $157.7 million in qualifying projects. The net plant balance for these projects totaled $140.2 million at December 31, 2015. These projects include an interstate 345 kV transmission line that connects the Company's A.B. Brown Generating Station to a generating station in Indiana owned by Duke Energy to the north and to a generating station in Kentucky owned by Big Rivers Electric Corporation to the south; a substation; and another transmission line. Although the allowed return is currently being challenged as discussed below in Rate and Regulatory Matters, once placed into service, these projects earn a FERC approved equity rate of return of 12.38 percent on the net plant balance. Operating expenses are also recovered. The Company has established a reserve pending the outcome of these complaints. The 345 kV project is the largest of these qualifying projects, with a cost of $106.8 million that earned the FERC approved equity rate of return, including while under construction. The last segment of that project was placed into service in December 2012.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, margin from off-system sales was $6.2 million, compared to $7.8 million in 2014 and $7.2 million in 2013. The base rate changes implemented in May 2011 require that wholesale margin from off-system sales earned above or below $7.5 million per year are shared equally with customers. Results in 2015 compared to 2014 reflect lower market pricing due to low natural gas prices, net of sharing. Off-system sales were 337.8 GWh in 2015, compared to 651.1 GWh in 2014, and 514.4 GWh in 2013.\nOperating Expenses\nOther Operating\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Other operating expenses were $339.1 million, and compared to 2014, decreased $15.4 million. The decrease in operating costs for the year is primarily due to decreases in costs not recovered directly in margin. Excluding pass through costs, other operating expenses decreased $15.3 million compared to 2014, primarily from a decrease in performance-based compensation expense of $7.1 million and decreased expenses in power plant maintenance costs of $6.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, Other operating expenses increased $21.1 million compared to 2013. Costs recovered directly in margin account for $12.4 million of the increase during 2014. Excluding these pass through costs, other operating expenses increased $8.7 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily from an increase in performance-based compensation expense of $5.5 million and increased expenses related to gas system maintenance of $4.3 million largely due to the harsh winter weather in the first part of 2014.\nDepreciation & Amortization\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Depreciation and amortization expense was $208.8 million, compared to $203.1 million in 2014 and $196.4 million in 2013. Results in the periods presented reflect increased utility plant investments placed into service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $3.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $3.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to decreased gas costs and thus lower revenues and related revenue taxes.\nThe increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher revenue taxes associated with increased consumption and higher gas costs.\nOther Income-Net\nOther income-net reflects income of $18.7 million in 2015, compared to $16.8 million in 2014 and $10.5 million in 2013. Results include increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) of approximately $4.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. These increases are partially offset by decreases in returns on assets that fund certain benefit plans. Results in 2014 also reflect increased AFUDC of $7.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increased AFUDC in the periods presented is driven by increased capital expenditures related to gas utility infrastructure replacement investments.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Utility Holdings' federal and state income taxes were $88.1 million, compared to $83.2 million in 2014 and $85.3 million in 2013. While income taxes increased primarily due to increased income in 2015, the effective tax rate in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to an increase in research and development tax credits. The decrease in income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the revaluation of Utility Holdings' deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels, Inc. in 2014. Additionally, 2015 and 2014 reflect increases in tax deductions for domestic production activity compared to 2013.\nGas Rate and Regulatory Matters\nRegulatory Treatment of Investments in Natural Gas Infrastructure Replacement\nThe Company monitors and maintains its natural gas distribution system to ensure natural gas is delivered in a safe and efficient manner. The Company's natural gas utilities are currently engaged in programs to replace bare steel and cast iron infrastructure and other activities in both Indiana and Ohio to mitigate risk, improve the system, and comply with applicable regulations, many of which are a result of federal pipeline safety requirements. Laws passed in both Indiana and Ohio provide utilities the opportunity to timely recover costs of federally mandated projects and other infrastructure improvement projects outside of a base rate proceeding.\nIn April 2011, Indiana Senate Bill 251 (Senate Bill 251) was signed into Indiana law. The law provides a framework to recover 80 percent of federally mandated costs through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case. Such costs include a return on the federally mandated capital investment, based on the overall rate of return most recently approved by the Commission, along with recovery of depreciation and other operating costs associated with these mandates. The remaining 20 percent of those costs is deferred for future recovery in the utility's next general rate case.\nIn April 2013, Indiana Senate Bill 560 (Senate Bill 560) was signed into Indiana law. This legislation supplements Senate Bill 251 described above, and provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for projects that either improve electric and gas system reliability and safety or are economic development projects that provide rural areas with access to gas service. Provisions of the legislation require that, among other things, requests for recovery include a seven-year project plan. Once the plan is approved by the IURC, 80 percent of such costs are eligible for current recovery using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on the investment that reflects the current capital structure and associated costs, with the exception of the rate of return on equity, which remains fixed at the rate determined in the Company's last rate case. Recoverable costs also include recovery of depreciation and other operating expenses. The remaining 20 percent of project costs are deferred and recovered in the utility's next general rate case, which must be filed before the expiration of the seven-year plan. The adjustment mechanism is capped at an annual increase in retail revenues of no more than two percent.\nIn June 2011, Ohio House Bill 95 (House Bill 95) was signed into law. Outside of a base rate proceeding, this legislation permits a natural gas utility to apply for recovery of much of its capital expenditure program. The legislation also allows for the deferral of costs, such as depreciation, property taxes, and debt-related post-in-service carrying costs until recovery is approved by the PUCO.\nIndiana Recovery and Deferral Mechanisms\nThe Company's Indiana natural gas utilities received Orders in 2008 and 2007 associated with the most recent base rate cases. These Orders authorized the deferral of financial impacts associated with bare steel and cast iron replacement activities. The Orders provide for the deferral of depreciation and post-in-service carrying costs on qualifying projects totaling $20 million annually at Indiana Gas and $3 million annually at SIGECO. The debt-related post-in-service carrying costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income currently. The recording of post-in-service carrying costs and depreciation deferral is limited by individual qualifying projects to three years after being placed into service at SIGECO and four years after being placed into service at Indiana Gas. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company has regulatory assets totaling $19.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, associated with the deferral of depreciation and debt-related post-in-service carrying cost activities. Beginning in 2014, all bare steel and cast iron replacement activities are now part of the Company's seven-year capital investment plan filed pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, discussed further below.\nRequests for Recovery under Indiana Regulatory Mechanisms\nOn August 27, 2014, the IURC issued an Order (August 2014 Order) approving the Company's seven-year capital infrastructure replacement and improvement plan, beginning in 2014, and the proposed accounting authority and recovery. Compliance projects and other infrastructure improvement projects were approved pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, respectively. As provided in the two laws, the Order approved semi-annual filings for rate recovery of 100 percent of the costs, inclusive of return, related to these capital investments and operating expenses, with 80 percent of the costs, including a return, recovered currently via an approved tracking mechanism and 20 percent of the costs deferred and recovered in the Company's next base rate proceeding. In addition, the Order established guidelines to annually update the seven-year capital investment plan. Finally, the Order approved the Company's proposal to recover eligible costs via a fixed monthly charge per residential customer.\nOn September 26, 2014, the OUCC filed an appeal of the IURC's finding that the remaining value of retired assets replaced during the infrastructure projects should not be netted against the cost being recovered in the tracking mechanism. In June 2015, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued an opinion in favor of the Company that affirmed the IURC's August 2014 Order approving the infrastructure plan.\nOn January 14, 2015, the IURC issued an Order approving the Company's initial request for recovery of the revenue requirement through June 30, 2014 as part of its approved seven-year plan. Also, consistent with the guidelines set forth in the original August 2014 Order, the IURC approved the Company's update to its seven-year plan, to reflect changes", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nUtility Holdings generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers. Utility Holdings' primary source of cash flow results from the collection of customer bills and payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services. Utility Holdings segregates its utility operations between a Gas Utility Services operating segment and an Electric Utility Services operating segment.\nVectren has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management. The committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of Utility Holdings' SEC filings.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nExecutive Summary of Consolidated Results of Operations\nDuring 2015, Utility Holdings earned $160.9 million, compared to $148.4 million in 2014 and $141.8 million in 2013. The improved results in 2015 compared to 2014 are largely driven by returns earned on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs, offset somewhat by a decrease in electric margin primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather in the fourth quarter of 2014. Decreases in operating expenses related to performance-based compensation and the timing of power plant maintenance costs also favorably impacted earnings, as did increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Results in 2014 compared to 2013 reflect increased gas and electric margins. However, these increased margins were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in performance-based compensation expense and gas system maintenance resulting from the harsh winter in the first part of 2014.\nGas utility services\nThe gas utility segment earned $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $57.0 million in 2014 and $55.7 million in 2013. The improved results in the periods presented are primarily due to increased returns on the Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs as the investment in those programs continues to increase. Increased earnings in 2015 also resulted from growth in small customer count and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense. These increases were somewhat offset by the unfavorable impacts of weather on the Company's Ohio business in 2015. The increased margin in 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by higher operating expenses from increased performance-based compensation expense and increased weather-related maintenance of the gas system during the first half of 2014.\nElectric utility services\nThe electric operations earned $82.6 million during 2015, compared to $79.7 million in 2014 and $75.8 million in 2013. Results in 2014 reflected the favorable impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimated the after tax impact to be approximately $2.2 million compared to 2015. Lower wholesale margin due primarily to lower market pricing also reduced 2015 results when compared to 2014. Lower operating expenses in 2015 driven primarily by decreases in power plant maintenance costs and performance-based compensation, favorably impacted 2015 results. Improved 2014 results compared to 2013 were due primarily to the impact of weather on retail electric margin, which management estimates the after tax impact to be approximately $1.1 million favorable compared to 2013 as well as an increase in lost revenue recovery margin related to electric conservation programs, which had an after tax favorable impact of $2.3 million. These improved results were offset somewhat by higher operating costs, including higher performance-based compensation and the acceleration of power supply maintenance projects completed in 2014.\nOther utility operations\nIn 2015, earnings from other utility operations were $13.9 million, compared to $11.7 million in 2014 and $10.3 million in 2013. An increase in earnings was driven by a lower effective income tax rate in 2015, from increased research and development tax credits for certain qualifying information technology assets. Approximately $3.5 million of this increase was related to research\nand development tax credits for prior periods as the Internal Revenue Service recently issued guidance that provided clarifications of internal-use software that qualifies for the credit. The revaluation of deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels and the rate reduction from a change in the Indiana tax legislation passed in 2014, resulted in higher earnings in 2014 compared to 2013.\nThe Regulatory Environment\nGas and electric operations are regulated by the IURC, with regard to retail rates and charges, terms of service, accounting matters, financing, and certain other operational matters specific to its Indiana customers (the operations of SIGECO and Indiana Gas). The retail gas operations of VEDO are subject to regulation by the PUCO.\nIn the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. Similar usage risks in Ohio are diminished by a straight fixed variable rate design for the Company's residential customers. In addition to these mechanisms, the commissions have authorized gas infrastructure replacement programs in all natural gas service territories, which allow for recovery of these investments outside of a base rate case proceeding. Further, rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment (GCA) clause and electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause (FAC). Both of these cost tracker mechanisms allow for the timely adjustment in charges to reflect changes in the cost of gas and cost for fuel. The Company utilizes similar mechanisms for other material operating costs, which allow for changes in revenue outside of a base rate case. Primarily as a result of rate mechanisms, the Company's last increase in base rates was 2011 for its electric business and 2009 for its gas business.\nRate Design Strategies\nSales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather. Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as the Company's utilities have implemented conservation programs. In the Company's two Indiana natural gas service territories, normal temperature adjustment (NTA) and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns. The Ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers. This rate design, which was fully implemented in February 2010, mitigates approximately 90 percent of the Ohio service territory's weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small customer classes.\nIn all natural gas service territories, the commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs. In Indiana, state laws were passed in 2012 and 2013 that expand the ability of utilities to recover, outside of a base rate proceeding, certain costs of federally mandated projects and other significant gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments. Legislation was passed in 2011 in Ohio that support the investment in other capital projects, allowing the utility to defer the impacts of these investments until its next base rate case. The Company has received approval to implement these mechanisms in both states.\nSIGECO's electric service territory currently recovers certain transmission investments outside of base rates. The electric service territory has neither an NTA nor a decoupling mechanism; however, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives.\nTracked Operating Expenses\nGas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve Indiana customers are two of the Company's most significant operating expenses. Rates charged to natural gas customers in Indiana contain a gas cost adjustment clause. The GCA clause allows the Company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas, inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on actual experience and subject to caps that are based on historical experience. Electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel. The net energy cost of purchased power, subject to an approved variable benchmark based on The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices, is also timely recovered through the FAC.\nGCA and FAC procedures involve periodic filings and IURC hearings to establish price adjustments for a designated future period. The procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the\nestimated costs and actual costs incurred. Since April 2010, the Company has not been the supplier of natural gas in its Ohio territory.\nThe IURC has also applied the statute authorizing GCA and FAC procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test. In the periods presented, the Company has not been impacted by the earnings test.\nIn Indiana, gas pipeline integrity management operating costs, costs to fund energy efficiency programs, MISO costs, and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery. In addition, certain operating costs, including depreciation associated with federally mandated investments, gas distribution and transmission infrastructure replacement investments, and regional electric transmission assets not in base rates are also recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery.\nIn Ohio, expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense, costs associated with exiting the merchant function, and costs associated with the infrastructure replacement program and other gas distribution capital expenditures are subject to recovery outside of base rates.\nRevenues and margins in both states are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes, which primarily fluctuate with gas and fuel costs.\nBase Rate Orders\nOver the last eight years, regulatory orders establishing new base rates have been received by each utility. SIGECO's electric territory received an order in April 2011, with rates effective May 2011, and its gas territory received an order and implemented rates in August 2007. Indiana Gas received its most recent base rate order and implemented rates in February 2008, and VEDO received an order in January 2009, with implementation in February 2009. The orders authorize a return on equity ranging from 10.15 percent to 10.40 percent. The authorized returns reflect the impact of rate design strategies that have been authorized by these state commissions.\nSee the Rate and Regulatory Matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the Company's utilities over the last three years.\nOperating Trends\nMargin\nThroughout this discussion, the terms Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin are used. Gas utility margin is calculated as Gas utility revenues less the Cost of gas sold. Electric utility margin is calculated as Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power. The Company believes Gas utility and Electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and these are generally collected on a dollar-for-dollar basis from customers.\nIn addition, the Company separately reflects regulatory expense recovery mechanisms within Gas utility margin and Electric utility margin. These amounts represent dollar-for-dollar recovery of other operating expenses. The Company utilizes these approved regulatory mechanisms to recover variations in operating expenses from the amounts reflected in base rates and are generally expenses that are subject to volatility. Following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations.\nGas utility margin\nGas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas utility revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>792.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of gas sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>468.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gas utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Regulatory expense recovery mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gas utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>475.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sold & transported volumes in MMDth attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sold & transported volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas utility margins were $487.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and compared to 2014, increased $11.3 million. Margin increased from returns on infrastructure replacement programs in Indiana and Ohio of $14.1 million compared to 2014. Customer margin also increased $1.5 million compared to 2014 from small customer growth. With rate designs that substantially limit the impact of weather on margin, heating degree days that were 95 percent of normal in Ohio and 88 percent of normal in Indiana during 2015, compared to 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, had only a slight unfavorable impact on small customer margin. However, warmer weather did decrease sold and transported volumes, resulting in lower regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding decrease in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin decreased $2.4 million compared to 2014.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gas utility margins increased $24.0 million compared to 2013. Heating degree days that were 110 percent of normal in Ohio and 107 percent of normal in Indiana during 2014, compared to 103 percent of normal in Ohio and 102 percent of normal in Indiana during 2013, had a slight favorable impact on small customer margin. Colder weather increased sold and transported volumes, which was the primary driver in the higher regulatory expense recovery margin and a corresponding increase in operating expenses. Regulatory expense recovery margin increased $15.0 million compared to 2013. Customer margin increased $3.8 million compared to 2013 from small customer growth and large customer usage. Additionally, margin was favorably impacted by $3.5 million from the return from infrastructure replacement programs, particularly in Ohio in 2014 compared to 2013.\nElectric utility margin (Electric utility revenues less Cost of fuel & purchased power)\nElectric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric utility revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of fuel & purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total electric utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Regulatory expense recovery mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal: retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Wholesale power & transmission system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total electric utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric volumes sold in GWh attributed to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential & commercial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,714.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,762.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,722.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Industrial customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,721.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,804.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,735.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total retail volumes sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,458.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,589.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,479.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail\nElectric retail utility margins were $382.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, compared to 2014, decreased by $6.7 million. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, reflect a $3.6 million decrease from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 88 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 107 percent of normal in 2014. While cooling degree days were 111 percent of normal in 2015 compared to 104 percent of normal in 2014, the increase in margin resulting from the increase in cooling degree days only partially offset the large decrease caused by the warmer winter in 2015. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $0.7 million compared to the prior year. Results also reflect a decrease in large customer usage of $1.5 million largely driven by timing of customer plant maintenance resulting in lower customer throughput. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms decreased $2.0 million as operating expenses associated with the electric conservation programs decreased.\nIn 2014, Electric retail utility margins were $389.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and, compared to 2013, increased by $9.3 million. As energy conservation initiatives continue, the Company's lost revenue recovery mechanism related to electric conservation programs contributed increased margin of $3.9 million compared to 2013. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, experienced a $1.8 million increase from weather in small customer margin as heating degree days were 107 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 102 percent of normal in 2013 and cooling degree days were 104 percent of normal in 2014 compared to 103 percent of normal in 2013. Results also reflect increased large customer usage, which had a favorable margin impact of $2.0 million. Margin from regulatory expense recovery mechanisms increased $1.1 million driven primarily by a corresponding increase in operating expenses associated with MISO costs.\nOn December 3, 2013, SABIC Innovative Plastics (SABIC), a large industrial utility customer of the Company, announced its plans to build a cogeneration (cogen) facility to be operational at the end of 2016 or early in 2017, in order to generate power to meet a significant portion of its ongoing power needs. Electric service is currently provided to SABIC by the Company under a long-term contract that expires in May of 2016. SABIC's historical peak electric usage has been approximately 120 megawatts (MW). The cogen facility is expected to provide approximately 80 MW of capacity. Therefore, the Company will continue to provide all of SABIC's power requirements above the approximate 80 MW capacity of the cogen, which is projected to be approximately 40 MW. The Company will also provide back-up power, when required.\nMargin from Wholesale Electric Activities\nThe Company earns a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the Company in its service territory that meet the criteria of the MISO's regional transmission expansion plans and also markets and sells its generating and transmission capacity\nto optimize the return on its owned assets. Substantially all off-system sales are generated in the MISO Day Ahead and Real Time markets when sales into the MISO in a given hour are greater than amounts purchased for native load. Further detail of MISO off-system margin and transmission system margin follows:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MISO transmission system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MISO off-system margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total wholesale margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransmission system margin associated with qualifying projects, including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms, and other transmission system operations, totaled $25.5 million during 2015, compared to $26.1 million in 2014 and $29.4 million in 2013. Results in 2015 and 2014 reflect lower returns on transmission investments associated with pending FERC ROE complaints. To date, the Company has invested $157.7 million in qualifying projects. The net plant balance for these projects totaled $140.2 million at December 31, 2015. These projects include an interstate 345 kV transmission line that connects the Company's A.B. Brown Generating Station to a generating station in Indiana owned by Duke Energy to the north and to a generating station in Kentucky owned by Big Rivers Electric Corporation to the south; a substation; and another transmission line. Although the allowed return is currently being challenged as discussed below in Rate and Regulatory Matters, once placed into service, these projects earn a FERC approved equity rate of return of 12.38 percent on the net plant balance. Operating expenses are also recovered. The Company has established a reserve pending the outcome of these complaints. The 345 kV project is the largest of these qualifying projects, with a cost of $106.8 million that earned the FERC approved equity rate of return, including while under construction. The last segment of that project was placed into service in December 2012.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, margin from off-system sales was $6.2 million, compared to $7.8 million in 2014 and $7.2 million in 2013. The base rate changes implemented in May 2011 require that wholesale margin from off-system sales earned above or below $7.5 million per year are shared equally with customers. Results in 2015 compared to 2014 reflect lower market pricing due to low natural gas prices, net of sharing. Off-system sales were 337.8 GWh in 2015, compared to 651.1 GWh in 2014, and 514.4 GWh in 2013.\nOperating Expenses\nOther Operating\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Other operating expenses were $339.1 million, and compared to 2014, decreased $15.4 million. The decrease in operating costs for the year is primarily due to decreases in costs not recovered directly in margin. Excluding pass through costs, other operating expenses decreased $15.3 million compared to 2014, primarily from a decrease in performance-based compensation expense of $7.1 million and decreased expenses in power plant maintenance costs of $6.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, Other operating expenses increased $21.1 million compared to 2013. Costs recovered directly in margin account for $12.4 million of the increase during 2014. Excluding these pass through costs, other operating expenses increased $8.7 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily from an increase in performance-based compensation expense of $5.5 million and increased expenses related to gas system maintenance of $4.3 million largely due to the harsh winter weather in the first part of 2014.\nDepreciation & Amortization\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Depreciation and amortization expense was $208.8 million, compared to $203.1 million in 2014 and $196.4 million in 2013. Results in the periods presented reflect increased utility plant investments placed into service.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $3.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $3.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to decreased gas costs and thus lower revenues and related revenue taxes.\nThe increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher revenue taxes associated with increased consumption and higher gas costs.\nOther Income-Net\nOther income-net reflects income of $18.7 million in 2015, compared to $16.8 million in 2014 and $10.5 million in 2013. Results include increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) of approximately $4.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. These increases are partially offset by decreases in returns on assets that fund certain benefit plans. Results in 2014 also reflect increased AFUDC of $7.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increased AFUDC in the periods presented is driven by increased capital expenditures related to gas utility infrastructure replacement investments.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Utility Holdings' federal and state income taxes were $88.1 million, compared to $83.2 million in 2014 and $85.3 million in 2013. While income taxes increased primarily due to increased income in 2015, the effective tax rate in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to an increase in research and development tax credits. The decrease in income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the revaluation of Utility Holdings' deferred income taxes related to the sale of Vectren Fuels, Inc. in 2014. Additionally, 2015 and 2014 reflect increases in tax deductions for domestic production activity compared to 2013.\nGas Rate and Regulatory Matters\nRegulatory Treatment of Investments in Natural Gas Infrastructure Replacement\nThe Company monitors and maintains its natural gas distribution system to ensure natural gas is delivered in a safe and efficient manner. The Company's natural gas utilities are currently engaged in programs to replace bare steel and cast iron infrastructure and other activities in both Indiana and Ohio to mitigate risk, improve the system, and comply with applicable regulations, many of which are a result of federal pipeline safety requirements. Laws passed in both Indiana and Ohio provide utilities the opportunity to timely recover costs of federally mandated projects and other infrastructure improvement projects outside of a base rate proceeding.\nIn April 2011, Indiana Senate Bill 251 (Senate Bill 251) was signed into Indiana law. The law provides a framework to recover 80 percent of federally mandated costs through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case. Such costs include a return on the federally mandated capital investment, based on the overall rate of return most recently approved by the Commission, along with recovery of depreciation and other operating costs associated with these mandates. The remaining 20 percent of those costs is deferred for future recovery in the utility's next general rate case.\nIn April 2013, Indiana Senate Bill 560 (Senate Bill 560) was signed into Indiana law. This legislation supplements Senate Bill 251 described above, and provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for projects that either improve electric and gas system reliability and safety or are economic development projects that provide rural areas with access to gas service. Provisions of the legislation require that, among other things, requests for recovery include a seven-year project plan. Once the plan is approved by the IURC, 80 percent of such costs are eligible for current recovery using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on the investment that reflects the current capital structure and associated costs, with the exception of the rate of return on equity, which remains fixed at the rate determined in the Company's last rate case. Recoverable costs also include recovery of depreciation and other operating expenses. The remaining 20 percent of project costs are deferred and recovered in the utility's next general rate case, which must be filed before the expiration of the seven-year plan. The adjustment mechanism is capped at an annual increase in retail revenues of no more than two percent.\nIn June 2011, Ohio House Bill 95 (House Bill 95) was signed into law. Outside of a base rate proceeding, this legislation permits a natural gas utility to apply for recovery of much of its capital expenditure program. The legislation also allows for the deferral of costs, such as depreciation, property taxes, and debt-related post-in-service carrying costs until recovery is approved by the PUCO.\nIndiana Recovery and Deferral Mechanisms\nThe Company's Indiana natural gas utilities received Orders in 2008 and 2007 associated with the most recent base rate cases. These Orders authorized the deferral of financial impacts associated with bare steel and cast iron replacement activities. The Orders provide for the deferral of depreciation and post-in-service carrying costs on qualifying projects totaling $20 million annually at Indiana Gas and $3 million annually at SIGECO. The debt-related post-in-service carrying costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income currently. The recording of post-in-service carrying costs and depreciation deferral is limited by individual qualifying projects to three years after being placed into service at SIGECO and four years after being placed into service at Indiana Gas. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company has regulatory assets totaling $19.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, associated with the deferral of depreciation and debt-related post-in-service carrying cost activities. Beginning in 2014, all bare steel and cast iron replacement activities are now part of the Company's seven-year capital investment plan filed pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, discussed further below.\nRequests for Recovery under Indiana Regulatory Mechanisms\nOn August 27, 2014, the IURC issued an Order (August 2014 Order) approving the Company's seven-year capital infrastructure replacement and improvement plan, beginning in 2014, and the proposed accounting authority and recovery. Compliance projects and other infrastructure improvement projects were approved pursuant to Senate Bill 251 and 560, respectively. As provided in the two laws, the Order approved semi-annual filings for rate recovery of 100 percent of the costs, inclusive of return, related to these capital investments and operating expenses, with 80 percent of the costs, including a return, recovered currently via an approved tracking mechanism and 20 percent of the costs deferred and recovered in the Company's next base rate proceeding. In addition, the Order established guidelines to annually update the seven-year capital investment plan. Finally, the Order approved the Company's proposal to recover eligible costs via a fixed monthly charge per residential customer.\nOn September 26, 2014, the OUCC filed an appeal of the IURC's finding that the remaining value of retired assets replaced during the infrastructure projects should not be netted against the cost being recovered in the tracking mechanism. In June 2015, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued an opinion in favor of the Company that affirmed the IURC's August 2014 Order approving the infrastructure plan.\nOn January 14, 2015, the IURC issued an Order approving the Company's initial request for recovery of the revenue requirement through June 30, 2014 as part of its approved seven-year plan. Also, consistent with the guidelines set forth in the original August 2014 Order, the IURC approved the Company's update to its seven-year plan, to reflect changes"}
