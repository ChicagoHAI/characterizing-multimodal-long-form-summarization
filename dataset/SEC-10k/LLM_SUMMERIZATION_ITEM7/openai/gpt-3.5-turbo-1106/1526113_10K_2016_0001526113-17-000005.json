Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on July 13, 2011 as a Maryland corporation. We acquired our first property and commenced active operations in October 2012 and elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We completed our IPO on June 30, 2014 and on June 2, 2015 we listed our Common Stock on the NYSE under the symbol \"GNL\".\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on August 8, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Global II. On December 22, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II merged with and into the Merger Sub, at which time the separate existence of Global II ceased and we became the parent of the Merger Sub. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II OP, merged with our OP, with our OP being the surviving entity.\nOur investment strategy is to acquire a diversified portfolio of commercial properties, with an emphasis on sale-leaseback transactions involving single tenant net-leased commercial properties. As of December 31, 2016, including the properties acquired in the Merger, we owned 310 net leased commercial properties consisting of 22.0 million rentable square feet. Based on original purchase price, 49.2% of our properties are located in the U.S. and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 28.2% are located in continental Europe and 22.5% are located in the United Kingdom. The properties were 100% leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor and our properties are managed and leased by the Property Manager. The Advisor, Property Manager and Special Limited Partner are under common control with the Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties, and have received and will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for various services provided to us and for the investment and management of our assets. The Advisor has retained the Service Provider to provide advisory and property management services with respect to investments located in Europe, subject to the Advisor's oversight. These services include, among others, sourcing and structuring of investments, sourcing and structuring of debt financing, due diligence, property management and leasing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had sold 34 properties (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cumulative straight-line rents receivable in the consolidated balance sheets were $30.5 million and $23.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our rental revenue included impacts of unbilled rental revenue of $10.6 million and $14.8 million, respectively, to adjust contractual rent to straight-line rent.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nIn business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nIn allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Properties that are intended to be sold are designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any properties designated as held for sale (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nWe evaluate acquired leases and new leases on acquired properties based on capital lease criteria. A lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. This situation is generally considered to be met if, among other things, the non-cancelable lease term is more than 75% of the useful life of the asset or if the present value of the minimum lease payments equals 90% or more of the leased property's fair value at lease inception.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts are amortized as an increase or reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective mortgages.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nFactors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from 12 to 18 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below market rent renewal does not renew, any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to the consolidated financial statements, the Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method for business combinations with the Company as the accounting acquirer.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. A triggering event is an event or circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Based on our assessment we determined that the goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2016 and no further analysis is required.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in our functional currency, the USD. We enter into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our functional currency.\nWe record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nMulti-Year Outperformance Agreement\nConcurrent with the Listing and modifications to Advisor agreement, we entered into the OPP with the OP and the Advisor. We record equity based compensation expense associated with the awards over the requisite service period of five years on a graded basis. The cumulative equity-based compensation expense is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the estimated market-related performance.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDuring 2015, we acquired 22 properties, of which 18 were acquired during the third quarter of 2015, bringing our total portfolio to 329 properties as of December 31, 2015. We experienced the results of 329 properties through predominantly the end of the third quarter of 2016, at which time, we had disposed of only three U.S. properties. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we disposed of 31 properties, inclusive of one property in the Netherlands, and through the Merger of Global II, we acquired 15 properties as of the Merger Date, bringing our total portfolio to 310 properties. As a result thereof, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect significant changes in most categories when comparing to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $204.0 million and $194.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our rental income increased compared to 2015, as the result of a full year of rental income for the 22 properties on 295 properties acquired during 2015 and additional rental income for the last 10 days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger. This was partially offset by the impact from the sale of 34 properties during the last two quarters of 2016 for an aggregate sales price of $110.4 million and currency declines.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The decrease over 2015 is largely driven by our dispositions of 34 properties in the second half of 2016 and currency declines, partially offset by additional operating expense reimbursements related to a full year of operating expense reimbursements for the 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expense reimbursements for the last ten days of 2016 related to the 15 properties acquired from the Merger.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $19.0 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The main exceptions are GSA properties for which certain expenses are not reimbursable by tenants. The increase is primarily driven by a full year of operating expenses recognized on 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expenses incurred for the ten days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger, partially offset by the impact of our disposition of 34 properties during the second half of 2016, and currency declines.\nOperating Fees to Related Parties\nOperating fees to related parties were $19.8 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating fees to related parties represent compensation paid to the Advisor for asset management services as well as property management fees paid to the Service Provider for our European investments. Prior to April 1, 2015, we compensated the Advisor by issuing restricted performance based subordinated participation interests in the OP in the form of Class B Units for asset management services. These Class B Units converted to OP Units as of the Listing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the board of directors approved the issuance of 1,020,580 Class B Units to the Advisor assuming a price of $9.00 per unit, all of which converted to OP Units upon Listing. There was no charge reflected in the financial statements for the issuance of Class B Units, until the Listing Date, at which time they were no longer subject to forfeiture. There were no Class B Units issued during the year ended December 31, 2016. With effect following the Listing Date, our Advisory Agreement requires us to pay Base Management Fee of $18.0 million per annum and variable fee or the Incentive Compensation, both payable in cash (see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details). Our operating fees have increased in 2016 due to incurring a full year on Base Management Fee of $18.0 million, $0.2 million of Incentive Compensation after new equity issuance during the period following the Listing Date due to Merger compared to 2015.\nOur Service Provider and Property Manager are entitled to fees for the management of our properties. Property management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, property management fees were $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The Property Manager elected to waive $2.3 million and $2.5 million of the property management fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe recognized $9.8 million of acquisition and transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of third party financial advisor fees, bridge facility commitment letter fees, auditor consent fees, legal fees and expenses as well as the cost of appraising the Global II properties that were acquired in the Merger. Acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $6.1 million primarily related to the purchase of 22 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million.\nListing Fees\nWe incurred a listing fee in 2015 in connection with our Listing of approximately $18.7 million. The majority of these fees were paid to related parties, see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details of the breakdown.\nVesting of Class B Units\nThere was no additional expense realized during the year ended December 31, 2016, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. Vesting of Class B Units expense was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. The performance condition related to these Class B Units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing and on June 2, 2015, the Class B Units were converted to OP Units on a one-to-one basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily consists of board member compensation, directors and officers' liability insurance, and professional fees including audit and taxation services.\nEquity Based Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $3.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of expense related to equity-based compensation primarily related to the amortization of the OPP and restricted shares granted to our independent directors of $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $94.5 million and $90.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 is due to our aforementioned full year of depreciation and amortization expense for our 22 property acquisitions during 2015, coupled with our depreciation and amortization expense for the last ten days of 2016 on the 15 properties acquired through the Merger. The increases were partially offset by the lack of depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 for the 34 dispositions during the second half of 2016 and currency declines.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $39.1 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily related to an increase in average borrowings throughout 2016 to fund our 2015 property acquisitions. Additionally, on the Merger Date, we incurred ten days of interest expense associated with our assumption of $107.0 million Mezzanine Facility obligations, which were subsequently reduced by $52.1 million of repayments and $276.3 million of mortgages, which were subsequently reduced by $12.6 million of repayments in connection with our payoff of the DB Luxembourg secondary mortgage. These increases were partially offset by currency declines.\nWe view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on our refinancing needs and our acquisition activity.\nGains on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nThe gains of $13.3 million on disposition of real estate investments is related to the sale of 34 assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no gains (losses) on dispositions of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nForeign Currency and Interest Rate Impact on Operations\nThe gains of $7.4 million and $3.9 million on derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflect the positive marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments used to hedge the investment portfolio from adverse currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by volatility in foreign currencies, particularly GBP and Euro.\nThe gains of $10.1 million and $5.1 million on undesignated foreign currency advances and other hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to the marked-to-market adjustments on the excess foreign currency draws over our net investments in the United Kingdom and Europe which are not designated as hedges.\nWe had no unrealized gains or (losses) on non-functional foreign currency advances not designated as net investment hedges for year ended December 31, 2016. The unrealized losses on non-functional foreign currency advances that were not designated as net investment hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.6 million. Effective May 17, 2015, additional foreign currency advances were designated as net investment hedges.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recognize income tax (expense) benefit for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, including foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit as a result of timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of those taxes. The income tax expense was $4.4 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe purchased 22 properties in 2015 compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 therefore reflect significant increases in most categories as portfolio was mostly stabilized in last quarter 2014 and 2015 is showing full year of operations for those assets as well as incremental growth from the addition of 22 properties, 18 of which were acquired in third quarter of 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $194.6 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant increase in rental income was driven by our acquisition of 22 properties since December 31, 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million, as of the respective acquisition dates. In addition, we had a full year of rental income on 270 properties acquired during 2014.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.7 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The increase over 2015 is largely driven by acquisitions made in latter part of 2014 and during 2015.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $18.2 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The increase is primarily driven by our acquisition of 22 properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014, most of which are triple net leases. The main exceptions are GSA properties for which certain expenses are not reimbursable by tenants.\nOperating Fees to Related Parties\nOperating fees to related parties were $15.2 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating fees to related parties represent compensation paid to the Advisor for asset management services as well as property management fees paid to the Service Provider for our European investments. Prior to April 1, 2015, we compensated the Advisor by issuing restricted performance based subordinated participation interests in the OP in the form of Class B Units for asset management services. These Class B Units converted to OP Units as of the Listing. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the board of directors approved the issuance of 1,020,580 and 682,351, respectively, Class B Units to the Advisor assuming a price of $9.00 per unit, all of which converted to OP Units upon Listing. There was no charge reflected in the financial statements for the issuance of Class B Units, until the Listing Date, at which time they were no longer subject to forfeiture. Our operating fees to related parties have increased in 2015 due to paying such fees in cash effective April 1, 2015. In addition, effective the Listing Date, our Advisory Agreement requires us to pay Base Management Fee of $18.0 million per annum and variable fee or the Incentive Compensation, subject to certain conditions, both payable in cash (see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details).\nOur Service Provider and Property Manager are entitled to fees for the management of our properties. Property management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, property management fees were $4.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Property Manager elected to waive $2.5 million and $0.7 million of the property management fees for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nAcquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $6.1 million primarily related to the purchase of 22 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million. Acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $83.5 million were incurred related to the 270 properties acquired during that period with an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 billion.\nListing Fees\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid approximately $18.7 million in listing related fees in association with the Listing. The majority of these fees were paid to related parties, see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details of the breakdown.\nVesting of Class B Units\nVesting of Class B Units expense was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. The performance condition related to these Class B Units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing and on June 2, 2015, the Class B Units were converted to OP Units on a one-to-one basis. We did not incur any expense relating to the vesting of Class B Units for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nChange in Fair Value of Listing Note\nThe Listing Note fair value was zero as of December 31, 2015. The Listing Note was marked-to-market quarterly, with changes in the value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Listing Note measurement period ended on January 23, 2016 and no amounts were payable pursuant to its terms. Accordingly, the Listing Note will have no further effect on our operations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily consist of board member compensation, directors and officers' liability insurance, and professional fees including audit and taxation services. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $4.3 million.\nEquity Based Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $2.2 million of expense related to equity-based compensation primarily related to the amortization of the OPP and $0.2 million related to amortization of restricted shares granted to our independent directors.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $90.1 million and $40.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The majority of the portfolio was acquired in 2014. The purchase price of acquired properties is allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives. The increase in 2015 is due to our acquisition of 22 properties, as well as the prior acquisitions incurring a full year of depreciation and amortization expense in 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $34.9 million and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily related to an increase in average borrowings and additional draws under our Credit Facility to fund our 2015 property acquisitions. In addition, during 2015, we encumbered an additional 36 properties via mortgages.\nWe view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on our refinancing needs and our acquisition activity.\nForeign Currency and Interest Rate Impact on Operations\nThere were minimal realized gains or (losses) on day-to-day foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting the limited effect of day-to-day movements in foreign currency exchange rates. A loss on foreign currency of $0.2 million was realized for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe gains on derivative instruments of $3.9 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflect the positive marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate hedge instruments used to protect the investment portfolio from adverse currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by volatility in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro.\nThe gains on hedges and derivatives deemed ineffective of $5.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, relate to the marked-to-market adjustments of slightly over-hedged portion of our European investments.\nThe unrealized losses on non-functional foreign currency advances that were not designated as net investment hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.6 million. There were no corresponding gains or (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Effective May 17, 2015, additional foreign currency advances were designated as net investment hedges.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nWe recognize income tax (expense) benefit for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, in foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit as a result of timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Our current income tax (expense) benefit fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of those taxes. The income tax (expense) benefit was $(5.9) million and $1.4 million for the years ended years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $114.4 million. The level of cash flows provided by operating activities is driven by, among other things, rental income received, operating fees paid to related parties paid for asset and property management and the amount of interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect a net income of $47.6 million adjusted for non-cash items of $94.0 million (primarily depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of mortgage premium/discount, amortization of mezzanine discount, amortization of above/below-market lease and ground lease assets and liabilities, bad debt expense, unbilled straight-line rent, and equity based compensation) and working capital items of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $134.1 million primarily related to proceeds from sale of real estate investments of $107.8 million on dispositions of 34 properties, cash acquired in Merger transaction of $19.0 million and restricted cash acquired in Merger transaction of $7.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $240.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to borrowings on the Credit Facility of $62.7 million and net advances from related parties of $2.2 million, offset by repayments on Credit Facility of $113.9 million, Mezzanine Facility of $51.8 million and mortgage notes payable of $13.4 million. Other payments included dividends to stockholders of $120.4 million and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $2.0 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $102.2 million. The level of cash flows provided by operating activities is driven by the volume of acquisition activity, related rental income received and the amount of interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Cash flows provided in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflect $6.1 million of acquisition and transaction related costs.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $222.3 million primarily related to our acquisition of 22 properties with an aggregate base purchase price of $255.0 million, which were partially funded with borrowings under our Credit Facility and mortgage notes payable.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $121.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to proceeds, net of receivables, from the issuance of Common Stock of $0.4 million, borrowings under Credit Facility of $476.2 million, proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $245.5 million and net advances from related parties of $0.4 million, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases of $127.3 million and repayments on Credit Facility of $373.2 million. Other payments included dividends to stockholders of $97.7 million and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $0.6 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in operating activities was $9.7 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a net loss, after adjustments for non-cash items, of $13.1 million (net loss of $53.6 million adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, net realized and unrealized mark-to-market transactions of $3.3 million and share based compensation of $0.1 million). Operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $83.5 million of acquisition and transaction related costs reflected in our net loss and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $20.6 million primarily related to prepaid professional fees due for strategic advisory services from our Former Dealer Manager and receivables due from the Advisor related to absorbed costs. These cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in deferred rent of $10.4 million and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of $15.7 million primarily related to accrued interest payable and local taxes.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $1.5 billion primarily related to our acquisition of 270 properties which were partially funded with borrowings under our Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities also includes a deposit of $0.8 million on a potential future acquisition.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $1.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to proceeds, net of receivables, from the issuance of Common Stock of $1.6 billion and net borrowings under our Credit Facility of $240.0 million, partly offset by payments related to offering costs of $168.3 million, payments of deferred financing costs of $16.9 million, dividends to stockholders of $35.4 million and restricted cash increases of $5.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.8 million. Principal future demands on cash and cash equivalents will include the purchase of additional properties or other investments in accordance with our investment strategy, payment of related acquisition costs, improvement costs, the payment of our operating and administrative expenses, continuing debt service obligations and dividends to our stockholders. Management expects that operating income from our properties should cover operating expenses and the payment of our monthly dividend.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used to pay our dividends was generated mainly from funds received from cash flows provided by operations and cash on hand. In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay dividends from operating cash flows, the Advisor may waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees. Until April 1, 2015, the Advisor and the Service Provider were issued Class B Units in lieu of asset management fees. Class B Units earned prior to April 2015 were exchanged for OP Units. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in property management fees payable to the Property Manager. The Advisor may elect to waive a portion of property management fees, and will determine if a portion or all of such fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Property Manager elected to waive approximately $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of property management fees. The fees that are waived are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by us. Because the Advisor may waive certain fees that we may owe, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor will be available to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAs we continue to build our portfolio of investments, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our dividends. As the cash flows from operations become more significant the Advisor may discontinue its practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements with the Advisor.\nGenerally, we fund our acquisitions through a combination of cash and cash equivalents with mortgage or other debt, but we also may acquire assets free and clear of permanent mortgage or other indebtedness. See Note 6 - Mortgage Notes Payable to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from future offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed cash from operations, if any.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have a revolving Credit Facility and Mezzanine Facility that currently permits us to borrow up to $740.0 million and \u20ac128.0 million, respectively. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility was July 25, 2016. On July 25, 2016, we extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to July 25, 2017, for an extension fee of $1.5 million. There is an additional one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions. The maturity date of the Mezzanine Facility is August 13, 2017. See Note 5 - Credit Borrowings to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms and conditions of the facilities. As of December 31, 2016, the unused borrowing capacity, based on the value of the borrowing base properties under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $113.0 million. The Company has no unused borrowing capacity under the Mezzanine Facility as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had gross mortgage notes payable net of mortgage discount of $752.5 million, outstanding advances under our Credit Facility of $616.6 million and Mezzanine Facility of $55.4 million. All of these borrowing bear interest at a weighted average interest rate per annum equal to 2.8%. Our debt leverage ratio was 45.9% (total debt as a percentage of total purchase price of real estate investments, based on the exchange rate at the time of purchase) as of December 31, 2016. See Note 7 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for fair value of such debt as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Mezzanine Facility will either need to be extended, refinanced or otherwise repaid by August 2017 using the proceeds from property sales or other potential source of capital. After considering the property and other collateral, the Mezzanine Facility is currently at 57.1% loan to fair value at December 31, 2016. Accordingly, if refinancing is necessary, management believes that it is probable that such loans can be commercially refinanced.\nManagement believes it has the ability to service its obligations as they come due.\nImplementation of At-the-Market\u201d Program\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with UBS Securities LLC, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Capital One Securities, Inc., Mizuho Securities USA Inc., and FBR Capital Markets & Co. (each, an Agent\u201d and collectively, the Agents\u201d), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer, issue and sell to the public, through the Agents, shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $175.0 million.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Agents will use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell, on our behalf, shares of common stock offered by us under and in accordance with the Equity Distribution Agreement. The sales, if any, of the Shares, made under the Equity Distribution Agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time.\nWe intend to use any net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including funding investment activity, repaying outstanding indebtedness (including borrowings under our Credit Facility), and for working capital. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the applicable Agent will be entitled to compensation for its services of up to 1.0% of the gross sales price of all Shares sold through it as Agent under the Equity Distribution Agreement. We have no obligation to sell any of the Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nThe Shares will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-214579). We filed a prospectus supplement (the Prospectus Supplement\u201d), dated December 12, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares. As of February 28, 2017, we have not sold any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nLoan Obligations\nOur loan obligations generally require us to pay principal and interest on a monthly or quarterly basis with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Our loan agreements stipulate compliance with specific reporting covenants. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.\nThe Advisor may, with approval from our independent board of directors, seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio. Such short-term borrowings may be obtained from third-parties on a case-by-case basis as acquisition opportunities present themselves.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis section includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations. A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, is provided below.\nFunds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (\"FFO\"), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the \"White Paper\"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property but including asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time, especially if not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation\nand amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO, Core FFO and AFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO, Core FFO and AFFO. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition (as we do) or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do or calculate Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs.\nWe consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP.\nCore FFO is FFO, excluding acquisition and transaction related costs as well as certain other costs that are considered to be non-core, such as charges relating to the Listing Note and listing related fees. The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make dividend payments to stockholders. In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction related costs as well as non-core costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.\nWe exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan. These items include early extinguishment of debt and unrealized gains and losses, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gains or losses on derivative investments, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and gains and losses on investments. In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of above-market and below-market leases intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, straight-line rent and equity-based compensation from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have a direct impact on our ongoing operating performance. We also include the realized gains or losses on foreign currency exchange contracts for AFFO as such items are part of our ongoing operations and affect the current operating performance of the Company. By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance without the impacts of transactions that are not related to the ongoing performance of our portfolio of properties. We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry. Further, we believe AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies. However, AFFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Investors are cautioned that AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as it excludes certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.\nIn calculating AFFO, we exclude certain expenses, which under GAAP are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. All paid and accrued merger, acquisition and transaction related fees and certain other expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of our on-going performance. AFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to companies that did not have such activities. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income. In addition, as discussed above, we view gains and losses from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the Company. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nAs a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted or added to net income (loss) attributable to stockholders in our calculation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO for the periods indicated.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Commencing with such taxable year, we were organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. Any of these taxes decrease our earnings and our available cash.\nIn addition, our international assets and operations, including those designated as direct or indirect qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a REIT, continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, we may be required to pay costs for maintenance and operation of properties which may adversely impact our results of operations due to potential increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nOn December 16, 2016, Global II entered into a letter agreement (the \"Letter Agreement\") with American Realty Capital Global II Advisors, LLC ( Global II Advisor\u201d) and AR Global, pursuant to which Global II Advisor agreed to reimburse Global II $6.3 million in organization and offering costs incurred by Global II in its IPO that exceeded 2.0% of gross offering proceeds in its IPO (the \"Excess Amount\"). Global II's initial public offering was suspended in November 2015 and lapsed in accordance with its terms in August 2016.\nThe Letter Agreement provided for reimbursement of the Excess Amount to Global II through (1) the tender of 66,344 Class B Units of limited partnership interest of Global II OP (\"Global II Class B Units\"), previously issued to the Global II Advisor as payment in lieu of cash for its provision of asset management services, and (2) the payment of the balance of the Excess Amount in equal cash installments over an eight month period. The value of the Excess Amount was determined using a valuation for each Global II Class B Unit based on 2.27 times the 30-day volume weighted average price of each share of Company Stock on the Merger Date.\nWe have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, whereby we have paid or will in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to the Advisor or its affiliates and entities under common ownership with the Advisor in connection with items such as acquisition and financing activities, transfer agency services, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. The predecessor to AR Global was a party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ( RCS Advisory\u201d), pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided us and certain other companies sponsored by AR Global with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services, among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. The predecessor to AR Global instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided by RCS Advisory. We were also party to a transfer agency agreement with American National Stock Transfer, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ( ANST\u201d), pursuant to which ANST provided us with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by a third-party transfer agent. AR Global received written notice from ANST on February 10, 2016 that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. See Note 11 - Related Party Transactions to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors other than our future obligations under nonconcealable operating ground leases (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies and Contractual Obligations for details).", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of the company.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on July 13, 2011 as a Maryland corporation. We acquired our first property and commenced active operations in October 2012 and elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We completed our IPO on June 30, 2014 and on June 2, 2015 we listed our Common Stock on the NYSE under the symbol \"GNL\".\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on August 8, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Global II. On December 22, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II merged with and into the Merger Sub, at which time the separate existence of Global II ceased and we became the parent of the Merger Sub. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II OP, merged with our OP, with our OP being the surviving entity.\nOur investment strategy is to acquire a diversified portfolio of commercial properties, with an emphasis on sale-leaseback transactions involving single tenant net-leased commercial properties. As of December 31, 2016, including the properties acquired in the Merger, we owned 310 net leased commercial properties consisting of 22.0 million rentable square feet. Based on original purchase price, 49.2% of our properties are located in the U.S. and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 28.2% are located in continental Europe and 22.5% are located in the United Kingdom. The properties were 100% leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor and our properties are managed and leased by the Property Manager. The Advisor, Property Manager and Special Limited Partner are under common control with the Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties, and have received and will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for various services provided to us and for the investment and management of our assets. The Advisor has retained the Service Provider to provide advisory and property management services with respect to investments located in Europe, subject to the Advisor's oversight. These services include, among others, sourcing and structuring of investments, sourcing and structuring of debt financing, due diligence, property management and leasing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had sold 34 properties (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cumulative straight-line rents receivable in the consolidated balance sheets were $30.5 million and $23.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our rental revenue included impacts of unbilled rental revenue of $10.6 million and $14.8 million, respectively, to adjust contractual rent to straight-line rent.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nIn business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nIn allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Properties that are intended to be sold are designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any properties designated as held for sale (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nWe evaluate acquired leases and new leases on acquired properties based on capital lease criteria. A lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. This situation is generally considered to be met if, among other things, the non-cancelable lease term is more than 75% of the useful life of the asset or if the present value of the minimum lease payments equals 90% or more of the leased property's fair value at lease inception.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts are amortized as an increase or reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective mortgages.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nFactors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from 12 to 18 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below market rent renewal does not renew, any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to the consolidated financial statements, the Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method for business combinations with the Company as the accounting acquirer.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. A triggering event is an event or circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Based on our assessment we determined that the goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2016 and no further analysis is required.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in our functional currency, the USD. We enter into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our functional currency.\nWe record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nMulti-Year Outperformance Agreement\nConcurrent with the Listing and modifications to Advisor agreement, we entered into the OPP with the OP and the Advisor. We record equity based compensation expense associated with the awards over the requisite service period of five years on a graded basis. The cumulative equity-based compensation expense is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the estimated market-related performance.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDuring 2015, we acquired 22 properties, of which 18 were acquired during the third quarter of 2015, bringing our total portfolio to 329 properties as of December 31, 2015. We experienced the results of 329 properties through predominantly the end of the third quarter of 2016, at which time, we had disposed of only three U.S. properties. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we disposed of 31 properties, inclusive of one property in the Netherlands, and through the Merger of Global II, we acquired 15 properties as of the Merger Date, bringing our total portfolio to 310 properties. As a result thereof, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect significant changes in most categories when comparing to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $204.0 million and $194.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our rental income increased compared to 2015, as the result of a full year of rental income for the 22 properties on 295 properties acquired during 2015 and additional rental income for the last 10 days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger. This was partially offset by the impact from the sale of 34 properties during the last two quarters of 2016 for an aggregate sales price of $110.4 million and currency declines.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The decrease over 2015 is largely driven by our dispositions of 34 properties in the second half of 2016 and currency declines, partially offset by additional operating expense reimbursements related to a full year of operating expense reimbursements for the 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expense reimbursements for the last ten days of 2016 related to the 15 properties acquired from the Merger.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $19.0 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The main exceptions are GSA properties for which certain expenses are not reimbursable by tenants. The increase is primarily driven by a full year of operating expenses recognized on 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expenses incurred for the ten days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger, partially offset by the impact of our disposition of 34 properties during the second half of 2016, and currency declines.\nOperating Fees to Related Parties\nOperating fees to related parties were $19.8 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating fees to related parties represent compensation paid to the Advisor for asset management services as well as property management fees paid to the Service Provider for our European investments. Prior to April 1, 2015, we compensated the Advisor by issuing restricted performance based subordinated participation interests in the OP in the form of Class B Units for asset management services. These Class B Units converted to OP Units as of the Listing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the board of directors approved the issuance of 1,020,580 Class B Units to the Advisor assuming a price of $9.00 per unit, all of which converted to OP Units upon Listing. There was no charge reflected in the financial statements for the issuance of Class B Units, until the Listing Date, at which time they were no longer subject to forfeiture. There were no Class B Units issued during the year ended December 31, 2016. With effect following the Listing Date, our Advisory Agreement requires us to pay Base Management Fee of $18.0 million per annum and variable fee or the Incentive Compensation, both payable in cash (see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details). Our operating fees have increased in 2016 due to incurring a full year on Base Management Fee of $18.0 million, $0.2 million of Incentive Compensation after new equity issuance during the period following the Listing Date due to Merger compared to 2015.\nOur Service Provider and Property Manager are entitled to fees for the management of our properties. Property management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, property management fees were $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The Property Manager elected to waive $2.3 million and $2.5 million of the property management fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe recognized $9.8 million of acquisition and transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of third party financial advisor fees, bridge facility commitment letter fees, auditor consent fees, legal fees and expenses as well as the cost of appraising the Global II properties that were acquired in the Merger. Acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $6.1 million primarily related to the purchase of 22 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million.\nListing Fees\nWe incurred a listing fee in 2015 in connection with our Listing of approximately $18.7 million. The majority of these fees were paid to related parties, see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details of the breakdown.\nVesting of Class B Units\nThere was no additional expense realized during the year ended December 31, 2016, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. Vesting of Class B Units expense was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. The performance condition related to these Class B Units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing and on June 2, 2015, the Class B Units were converted to OP Units on a one-to-one basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily consists of board member compensation, directors and officers' liability insurance, and professional fees including audit and taxation services.\nEquity Based Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $3.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of expense related to equity-based compensation primarily related to the amortization of the OPP and restricted shares granted to our independent directors of $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $94.5 million and $90.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 is due to our aforementioned full year of depreciation and amortization expense for our 22 property acquisitions during 2015, coupled with our depreciation and amortization expense for the last ten days of 2016 on the 15 properties acquired through the Merger. The increases were partially offset by the lack of depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 for the 34 dispositions during the second half of 2016 and currency declines.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $39.1 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily related to an increase in average borrowings throughout 2016 to fund our 2015 property acquisitions. Additionally, on the Merger Date, we incurred ten days of interest expense associated with our assumption of $107.0 million Mezzanine Facility obligations, which were subsequently reduced by $52.1 million of repayments and $276.3 million of mortgages, which were subsequently reduced by $12.6 million of repayments in connection with our payoff of the DB Luxembourg secondary mortgage. These increases were partially offset by currency declines.\nWe view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on our refinancing needs and our acquisition activity.\nGains on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nThe gains of $13.3 million on disposition of real estate investments is related to the sale of 34 assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no gains (losses) on dispositions of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nForeign Currency and Interest Rate Impact on Operations\nThe gains of $7.4 million and $3.9 million on derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflect the positive marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments used to hedge the investment portfolio from adverse currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by volatility in foreign currencies, particularly GBP and Euro.\nThe gains of $10.1 million and $5.1 million on undesignated foreign currency advances and other hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to the marked-to-market adjustments on the excess foreign currency draws over our net investments in the United Kingdom and Europe which are not designated as hedges.\nWe had no unrealized gains or (losses) on non-functional foreign currency advances not designated as net investment hedges for year ended December 31, 2016. The unrealized losses on non-functional foreign currency advances that were not designated as net investment hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.6 million. Effective May 17, 2015, additional foreign currency advances were designated as net investment hedges.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recognize income tax (expense) benefit for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, including foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit as a result of timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of those taxes. The income tax expense was $4.4 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe purchased 22 properties in 2015 compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 therefore reflect significant increases in most categories as portfolio was mostly stabilized in last quarter 2014 and 2015 is showing full year of operations for those assets as well as incremental growth from the addition of 22 properties, 18 of which were acquired in third quarter of 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $194.6 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant increase in rental income was driven by our acquisition of 22 properties since December 31, 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million, as of the respective acquisition dates. In addition, we had a full year of rental income on 270 properties acquired during 2014.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.7 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The increase over 2015 is largely driven by acquisitions made in latter part of 2014 and during 2015.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $18.2 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The increase is primarily driven by our acquisition of 22 properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014, most of which are triple net", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on July 13, 2011 as a Maryland corporation. We acquired our first property and commenced active operations in October 2012 and elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We completed our IPO on June 30, 2014 and on June 2, 2015 we listed our Common Stock on the NYSE under the symbol \"GNL\".\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on August 8, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Global II. On December 22, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II merged with and into the Merger Sub, at which time the separate existence of Global II ceased and we became the parent of the Merger Sub. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II OP, merged with our OP, with our OP being the surviving entity.\nOur investment strategy is to acquire a diversified portfolio of commercial properties, with an emphasis on sale-leaseback transactions involving single tenant net-leased commercial properties. As of December 31, 2016, including the properties acquired in the Merger, we owned 310 net leased commercial properties consisting of 22.0 million rentable square feet. Based on original purchase price, 49.2% of our properties are located in the U.S. and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 28.2% are located in continental Europe and 22.5% are located in the United Kingdom. The properties were 100% leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nWe are externally managed by the Advisor and our properties are managed and leased by the Property Manager. The Advisor, Property Manager and Special Limited Partner are under common control with the Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties, and have received and will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for various services provided to us and for the investment and management of our assets. The Advisor has retained the Service Provider to provide advisory and property management services with respect to investments located in Europe, subject to the Advisor's oversight. These services include, among others, sourcing and structuring of investments, sourcing and structuring of debt financing, due diligence, property management and leasing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we had sold 34 properties (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cumulative straight-line rents receivable in the consolidated balance sheets were $30.5 million and $23.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our rental revenue included impacts of unbilled rental revenue of $10.6 million and $14.8 million, respectively, to adjust contractual rent to straight-line rent.\nWe continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nInvestments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nWe evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nIn business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below- market leases and other identifiable assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values.\nIn allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates.\nDisposal of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. No properties were presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Properties that are intended to be sold are designated as held for sale\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any properties designated as held for sale (see Note 4 - Real Estate Investments, Net to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\nWe evaluate acquired leases and new leases on acquired properties based on capital lease criteria. A lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant. This situation is generally considered to be met if, among other things, the non-cancelable lease term is more than 75% of the useful life of the asset or if the present value of the minimum lease payments equals 90% or more of the leased property's fair value at lease inception.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nCapitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nCapitalized above-market ground lease values are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.\nThe value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.\nAssumed mortgage premiums or discounts are amortized as an increase or reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective mortgages.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net earnings.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.\nFactors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from 12 to 18 months. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nAbove-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. If a tenant with a below market rent renewal does not renew, any remaining unamortized amount will be taken into income at that time.\nThe aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant. Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of its existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.\nThe value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.\nIn making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 3 - Merger Transaction to the consolidated financial statements, the Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method for business combinations with the Company as the accounting acquirer.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. A triggering event is an event or circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Based on our assessment we determined that the goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2016 and no further analysis is required.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. Certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in our functional currency, the USD. We enter into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our functional currency.\nWe record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. If we elect not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations. If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.\nMulti-Year Outperformance Agreement\nConcurrent with the Listing and modifications to Advisor agreement, we entered into the OPP with the OP and the Advisor. We record equity based compensation expense associated with the awards over the requisite service period of five years on a graded basis. The cumulative equity-based compensation expense is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the estimated market-related performance.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDuring 2015, we acquired 22 properties, of which 18 were acquired during the third quarter of 2015, bringing our total portfolio to 329 properties as of December 31, 2015. We experienced the results of 329 properties through predominantly the end of the third quarter of 2016, at which time, we had disposed of only three U.S. properties. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we disposed of 31 properties, inclusive of one property in the Netherlands, and through the Merger of Global II, we acquired 15 properties as of the Merger Date, bringing our total portfolio to 310 properties. As a result thereof, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect significant changes in most categories when comparing to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $204.0 million and $194.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our rental income increased compared to 2015, as the result of a full year of rental income for the 22 properties on 295 properties acquired during 2015 and additional rental income for the last 10 days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger. This was partially offset by the impact from the sale of 34 properties during the last two quarters of 2016 for an aggregate sales price of $110.4 million and currency declines.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The decrease over 2015 is largely driven by our dispositions of 34 properties in the second half of 2016 and currency declines, partially offset by additional operating expense reimbursements related to a full year of operating expense reimbursements for the 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expense reimbursements for the last ten days of 2016 related to the 15 properties acquired from the Merger.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $19.0 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The main exceptions are GSA properties for which certain expenses are not reimbursable by tenants. The increase is primarily driven by a full year of operating expenses recognized on 22 properties acquired during 2015 and additional property operating expenses incurred for the ten days of 2016 for the 15 properties acquired from the Merger, partially offset by the impact of our disposition of 34 properties during the second half of 2016, and currency declines.\nOperating Fees to Related Parties\nOperating fees to related parties were $19.8 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating fees to related parties represent compensation paid to the Advisor for asset management services as well as property management fees paid to the Service Provider for our European investments. Prior to April 1, 2015, we compensated the Advisor by issuing restricted performance based subordinated participation interests in the OP in the form of Class B Units for asset management services. These Class B Units converted to OP Units as of the Listing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the board of directors approved the issuance of 1,020,580 Class B Units to the Advisor assuming a price of $9.00 per unit, all of which converted to OP Units upon Listing. There was no charge reflected in the financial statements for the issuance of Class B Units, until the Listing Date, at which time they were no longer subject to forfeiture. There were no Class B Units issued during the year ended December 31, 2016. With effect following the Listing Date, our Advisory Agreement requires us to pay Base Management Fee of $18.0 million per annum and variable fee or the Incentive Compensation, both payable in cash (see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details). Our operating fees have increased in 2016 due to incurring a full year on Base Management Fee of $18.0 million, $0.2 million of Incentive Compensation after new equity issuance during the period following the Listing Date due to Merger compared to 2015.\nOur Service Provider and Property Manager are entitled to fees for the management of our properties. Property management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, property management fees were $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The Property Manager elected to waive $2.3 million and $2.5 million of the property management fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAcquisition and Transaction Related Expenses\nWe recognized $9.8 million of acquisition and transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of third party financial advisor fees, bridge facility commitment letter fees, auditor consent fees, legal fees and expenses as well as the cost of appraising the Global II properties that were acquired in the Merger. Acquisition and transaction related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $6.1 million primarily related to the purchase of 22 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million.\nListing Fees\nWe incurred a listing fee in 2015 in connection with our Listing of approximately $18.7 million. The majority of these fees were paid to related parties, see Note 11 - Related Party Transactions for details of the breakdown.\nVesting of Class B Units\nThere was no additional expense realized during the year ended December 31, 2016, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. Vesting of Class B Units expense was $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the vesting of Class B Units previously issued to the Advisor for prior asset management services. The performance condition related to these Class B Units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing and on June 2, 2015, the Class B Units were converted to OP Units on a one-to-one basis.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily consists of board member compensation, directors and officers' liability insurance, and professional fees including audit and taxation services.\nEquity Based Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $3.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of expense related to equity-based compensation primarily related to the amortization of the OPP and restricted shares granted to our independent directors of $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $94.5 million and $90.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 is due to our aforementioned full year of depreciation and amortization expense for our 22 property acquisitions during 2015, coupled with our depreciation and amortization expense for the last ten days of 2016 on the 15 properties acquired through the Merger. The increases were partially offset by the lack of depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 for the 34 dispositions during the second half of 2016 and currency declines.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $39.1 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily related to an increase in average borrowings throughout 2016 to fund our 2015 property acquisitions. Additionally, on the Merger Date, we incurred ten days of interest expense associated with our assumption of $107.0 million Mezzanine Facility obligations, which were subsequently reduced by $52.1 million of repayments and $276.3 million of mortgages, which were subsequently reduced by $12.6 million of repayments in connection with our payoff of the DB Luxembourg secondary mortgage. These increases were partially offset by currency declines.\nWe view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on our refinancing needs and our acquisition activity.\nGains on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nThe gains of $13.3 million on disposition of real estate investments is related to the sale of 34 assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no gains (losses) on dispositions of assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nForeign Currency and Interest Rate Impact on Operations\nThe gains of $7.4 million and $3.9 million on derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflect the positive marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments used to hedge the investment portfolio from adverse currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by volatility in foreign currencies, particularly GBP and Euro.\nThe gains of $10.1 million and $5.1 million on undesignated foreign currency advances and other hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily relate to the marked-to-market adjustments on the excess foreign currency draws over our net investments in the United Kingdom and Europe which are not designated as hedges.\nWe had no unrealized gains or (losses) on non-functional foreign currency advances not designated as net investment hedges for year ended December 31, 2016. The unrealized losses on non-functional foreign currency advances that were not designated as net investment hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.6 million. Effective May 17, 2015, additional foreign currency advances were designated as net investment hedges.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recognize income tax (expense) benefit for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, including foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit as a result of timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of those taxes. The income tax expense was $4.4 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe purchased 22 properties in 2015 compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 therefore reflect significant increases in most categories as portfolio was mostly stabilized in last quarter 2014 and 2015 is showing full year of operations for those assets as well as incremental growth from the addition of 22 properties, 18 of which were acquired in third quarter of 2015.\nRental Income\nRental income was $194.6 million and $88.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The significant increase in rental income was driven by our acquisition of 22 properties since December 31, 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $255.0 million, as of the respective acquisition dates. In addition, we had a full year of rental income on 270 properties acquired during 2014.\nOperating Expense Reimbursements\nOperating expense reimbursements were $10.7 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our lease agreements generally require tenants to pay all property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, however some limited property operating expenses may be absorbed by us. Operating expense reimbursements primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by us and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. The increase over 2015 is largely driven by acquisitions made in latter part of 2014 and during 2015.\nProperty Operating Expense\nProperty operating expenses were $18.2 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs primarily relate to insurance costs and real estate taxes on our properties, which are generally reimbursable by the tenants. The increase is primarily driven by our acquisition of 22 properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to our portfolio of 307 properties as of December 31, 2014, most of which are triple net"}
