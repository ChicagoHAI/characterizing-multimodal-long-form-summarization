Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with Item 6 Selected Financial Data\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a)(1). In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements must be understood in the context of numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described previously in section 1A Risk Factors.\u201d\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nISG (Information Services Group) ( ISG\u201d) (Nasdaq: III) is a leading global technology research and advisory firm. A trusted business partner to more than 700 clients, including 75 of the top 100 enterprises in the world, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations, and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Founded in 2006, and based in Stamford, Conn., ISG employs approximately 1,300 professionals operating in more than 20 countries-a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on our comprehensive marketplace data.\nOur strategy is to strengthen our existing market position and develop new services and products to support future growth plans. As a result, we are focused on growing our existing service model, expanding geographically, developing new industry sectors, productizing market data assets, expanding our managed services offerings and growing via acquisitions. Although we do not expect any adverse conditions that will impact our ability to execute against our strategy over the next twelve months, the more significant factors that could limit our ability to grow in these areas include global macro-economic conditions and the impact on the overall sourcing market, competition, our ability to retain advisors and reductions in discretionary spending with our top client accounts or other significant client events. Other areas that could impact the business would also include natural disasters, legislative and regulatory changes and capital market disruptions.\nWe derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services. A portion of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis. Clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. There are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services, often referred to as fixed fee billings. This may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions. We also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives. Such revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results. We also derive our revenues from recurring revenue streams. This includes Managed Services, Research, the U.S. Public Sector, subscription services around RPA and analytic benchmarking. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal centric as opposed to project centric revenue\nstreams) or multi-year contracts. Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of even our traditional transaction services. Digital enablement provides capabilities, digital insights and better engagement with clients and partners.\nOur results are impacted principally by our full-time consultants' utilization rate, the number of business days in each quarter and the number of our revenue-generating professionals who are available to work. Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that result in a temporary drop in our utilization rate. Our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients. The number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter. We typically have fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. Time-and-expense engagements do not provide us with a high degree of predictability as to performance in future periods. Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in utilization and revenues and present a challenge to optimal hiring and staffing. The volume of work performed for any particular client can vary widely from period to period.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFor ISG, 2017 will be remembered as the year of the combination and integration when we leveraged the power of our expanded portfolio of services to deliver more value to our clients, more opportunities for our employees and improved financial performance for our shareholders. Before the start of the year, we announced ISG was combining with Alsbridge to create a leading technology research, advisory and digital transformation services firm. ISG launched a new brand identity, website and mobile app during the first week of January 2017, allowing the firm to bring Alsbridge quickly under our brand umbrella and take advantage of our expanded digital marketing capabilities. We expanded our portfolio of service to include new capabilities in RPA, Network Services and Software Solutions; partnering with our clients to help shape the digital future of their business. We also saw strong demand from our clients for other new or expanded capabilities, including Network and Software Advisory services and Organizational Change Management ( OCM\u201d) services. The latter is particularly valuable to our clients as they transition their organizations and prepare their people for sweeping digital transformation programs.\nISG is in a unique position to help shape the digital future of business for its clients-both buyers and sellers of technology services. Since our founding more than 10 years ago, we have continued to evolve to meet the changing needs of our clients-transforming ourselves from a firm principally focused on sourcing advisory to one offering a full range of technology research, consulting, managed services and events aimed at helping clients digitally transform their operations for greater efficiency and faster growth.\nIn the age of digital business, every company, no matter how they started or where they are heading, is going to be a technology company. Technology decisions are no longer being left to the IT department. Increasingly, business leaders are deciding how to employ technology to develop new products and services; which workloads to move to the cloud; which business functions to automate; where and how to deploy the Internet of Things; how to leverage data analytics and cognitive computing; how to integrate the work of humans and bots; and how to improve collaboration in an increasingly decentralized operating environment. Every business is going to be run based on data, analytics, cognitive intelligence and enhancing customer experience through technology. That's going to require new levels of innovation, design thinking, automation and complete transformation of business models.\nIn addition to enterprise buyers, service providers that were not born digital are struggling to meet these changing dynamics. They have relied for a long time on a labor arbitrage model, providing human labor at lower cost. Now they must make investments in automation, cognitive computing and digital strategy while they struggle with margin pressure and mid-single-digit growth. And the largest of them face competition from a whole host of nimble, niche technology players, and from the likes of Google and Amazon that offer cloud computing capabilities that power IaaS and SaaS platforms.\nISG continues to invest in expanding its digital services, including cloud solutions, agile development, automation, data analytics and the Internet of Things. Our RPA business, is a strong source of growth, as clients rush to automate their back-office functions, even as they look to the future of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. Innovation also plays a strong role in our organic growth. We will continue to develop new capabilities based on market demand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nRevenues\nRevenues are generally derived from fixed fee contracts as well as engagements priced on a time and materials basis which are recorded based on actual time worked as the services are performed. In addition, from time to time, we also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones. Revenues related to materials (mainly out-of-pocket expenses such as airfare, lodging and meals) required during an engagement generally do not include a profit mark-up and can be charged and reimbursed separately or as part of the overall fee arrangement. Invoices are issued to clients monthly, semimonthly or in accordance with the specific contractual terms of each project.\nWe operate in one segment, fact-based sourcing advisory services. We operate principally in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our foreign operations are subject to local government regulations and to the uncertainties of the economic and political conditions of those areas, and the revenue for our foreign operations is predominantly collected in local currency.\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeographic Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n161,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n269,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $53.1 million or approximately 25% in 2017. The increase in revenues in the Americas region was primarily attributable to higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily associated with the acquisitions of TracePoint and Alsbridge in 2016. The increase in the Europe region was primarily attributable to a higher level of sourcing activity in our Consulting line of business, primarily associated\nwith the acquisition of Alsbridge and increased sourcing revenue in Germany. The impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars did not have a material impact on revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect costs and expenses for advisors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n156,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n91,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n260,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $41.3 million for 2017 with increases in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits of $30.2 million, $5.6 million in travel, $1.1 million in professional fees, $0.6 million in information technology and $0.4 million in stock compensation expense. During 2017, we recorded $0.6 million for the loss on the sublease of Alsbridge's headquarters office. The increases were also due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. We recorded $7.4 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $7.0 million in 2016. In 2017, we also recorded $0.5 million related to the reversal of a tax indemnity receivable established with an unrealized tax benefit liability at the time of the acquisition of Alsbridge. The associated unrealized tax benefit liability was also reversed and recorded as a reduction in the tax provision. These cost increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in contract labor costs. SG&A costs in 2017 also included $2.3 million associated with acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense, compared to $6.3 million in 2016.\nCompensation costs consist of a mix of fixed and variable salaries, annual bonuses, benefits and retirement plan contributions. Statutory and 401(k) plans are offered to employees as appropriate. Direct costs also include employee taxes, health insurance, workers compensation and disability insurance.\nA portion of compensation expenses for certain billable employees are allocated between direct costs and selling, general and administrative costs based on relative time spent between billable and non-billable activities.\nSelling costs consist principally of compensation expense related to business development, proposal preparation and delivery, and negotiation of new client contracts. Selling costs also include travel expenses relating to the pursuit of sales opportunities, expenses for hosting periodic client conferences, public relations activities, participation in industry conferences, industry relations, website maintenance and business intelligence activities. Additionally, we maintain a dedicated global marketing function responsible for developing and managing sales campaigns, brand promotion, the ISG Index and assembling client proposals.\nWe maintain a comprehensive program for training and professional development with the related costs included in SG&A. Related expenses include product training, updates on new service offerings or methodologies and development of client project management skills. Also included in training and professional\ndevelopment are expenses associated with the development, enhancement and maintenance of our proprietary methodologies and tools and the systems that support them.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of executive management compensation, allocations of billable employee compensation related to general management activities, IT infrastructure, and costs for the finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative costs also reflect continued investment associated with implementing and operating client and employee management systems. Because our billable personnel operate primarily on client premises, all occupancy expenses are recorded as general and administrative.\nDepreciation expense in 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Amortization expense in 2017 and 2016 was $9.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million and $3.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal-use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nWe amortize our intangible assets (e.g., client relationships and databases) over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, trademark and trade names related to acquisitions are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing.\nOther (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,821)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,157)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(156)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(343)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(248)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(261)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,057)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,732)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,325)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(158)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total increase of $4.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.2 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2017 of $4.2 million as compared to $1.1 million for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 199.9% compared to (19.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the current year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act\u201d). The effective tax rate of the Company without the TCJ\nAct would have been 101.3% for the year. The increased rate for the year without the TCJ Act was primarily driven by our inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits and shortfalls on restricted stock awards.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeographic Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n108,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,632)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $7.3 million or approximately 3% in 2016. The increase in revenues in the Americas region was primarily attributable to higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily associated with the acquisition of TracePoint and Alsbridge. The increase in revenues in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributable to higher levels of Managed Services and higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting. The decrease in the Europe region was primarily attributable to lower levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily in the United Kingdom offset by higher levels of Research Services, primarily associated with the acquisition of Experton Group.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect costs and expenses for advisors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n124,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n199,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $19.5 million for 2016 with increases in SG&A expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits, contract labor, professional fees, interest on contingent consideration, stock compensation expense and travel expenses. We recorded $7.0 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $5.0 million in 2015. The increases were also due to the acquisition of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense of $6.3 million, were also included in selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 also included $0.4 million in transaction costs associated with our stock repurchase conducted through a\nmodified Dutch\u201d auction. These cost increases were partially offset by decreases in occupancy, conferences and bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in 2016 and 2015 was $7.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase of $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,789)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(875)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(49)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(398)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(131)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,732)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,472)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,260)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(86)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total increase of $1.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.4 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by losses associated with forward contracts that were used to hedge ISG's forecasted 2016 quarterly earnings recorded in Euro versus foreign currency gains in 2015 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2016 of $1.1 million as compared to $3.2 million for 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (19.8%) compared to 39.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of current year overall Company losses effect on the effective tax rate computation combined with increases in changes in valuation allowances placed against deferred tax assets and non-deductible expenses incurred in 2016.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nThis management's discussion and analysis presents supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information but are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We refer to these financial measures, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures\u201d under SEC rules, as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each as defined below. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for information about our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including\nthese measures and reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We provide adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income before net income attributable to non-controlling interest plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense, tax indemnity receivable, and bargain purchase gain), adjusted net income (defined as net income plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense and bargain purchase gain, on a tax-adjusted basis) and adjusted net income as earnings per diluted share, excluding the net of tax effect of the items set forth in the table below. These are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG's core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to evaluate the Company's business strategies and management's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company's performance.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The material terms under the 2016 Credit Agreement are as follows:\n\uf0b7Each of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 1, 2021 (the Maturity Date\u201d).\n\uf0b7The credit facility is secured by all of the equity interests owned by the Company, and its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and, subject to agreed exceptions, the Company's direct and indirect\nfirst-tier\u201d foreign subsidiaries and a perfected first priority security interest in all of the Company's and its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries' tangible and intangible assets.\n\uf0b7The Company's direct and indirect existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries serve as guarantors to the Company's obligations under the senior secured facility.\n\uf0b7At the Company's option, the credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Base Rate\u201d (which is the highest of (a) the rate publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its prime rate\u201d, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum and (c) the Eurodollar Rate, plus 1.0%), plus the applicable margin (as defined below) or (ii) Eurodollar Rate (adjusted for maximum reserves) as determined by the Administrative Agent, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is adjusted quarterly based upon the Company's quarterly leverage ratio.\n\uf0b7The Term Loan is repayable in four consecutive quarterly installments of $1,375,000 each, that commenced March 31, 2017, followed by eight consecutive quarterly installments in the amount of $2,062,500 each, commencing March 31, 2018, followed by seven consecutive quarterly installments of $2,750,000 each, commencing March 31, 2020 and a final payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan on the Maturity Date.\n\uf0b7Mandatory repayments of term loans shall be required from (subject to agreed exceptions) (i) 100% of the proceeds from asset sales by the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) 100% of the net proceeds from issuances of debt and equity by the Company and its subsidiaries and (iii) 100% of the net proceeds from insurance recovery and condemnation events of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\uf0b7The senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, place restrictions on matters customarily restricted in senior secured credit facilities, including restrictions on indebtedness (including guarantee obligations), liens, fundamental changes, sales or disposition of property or assets, investments (including loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock, optional payments and modifications of other material debt instruments, negative pledges and agreements restricting subsidiary distributions and changes in line of business. In addition, the Company is required to comply with a total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio.\n\uf0b7The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including cross-default to other material agreements, judgment default and change of control.\nOn February 10, 2017, as required by the 2016 Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 4% on the LIBOR component of its borrowings under the term loan facility until December 31, 2019. This interest rate cap was not designated for hedging or speculative purposes. The expense related to this interest rate cap was not material.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total principal outstanding under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility was $104.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The effective interest rate for the term loan facility and revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017 was 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively.\nOn January 4, 2011, as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Compass, we issued an aggregate of $6.3 million in convertible notes to Compass (the Compass Notes\u201d). The Compass Notes had a maturity date of January 4, 2018 with interest payable on the outstanding principal amount, computed daily, at the rate of\n3.875% per annum, on January 31 of each calendar year and on the seventh anniversary of the date of the Compass Notes. In 2013 and 2016, we prepaid substantial portions of the outstanding principal amount of the Compass Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the total principal outstanding under the remaining Compass Notes was $0.2 million. On January 4, 2018, we paid off the outstanding principal and interest on the Compass Notes.\nThe Compass Notes were subject to transfer restrictions until January 31, 2013. If the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market exceeded $4 per share for 60 consecutive trading days (the Trigger Event\u201d), the holder of the Compass Notes could convert all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal amount of the Compass Notes into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1 share for every $4 in principal amount outstanding. After the Trigger Event, we could prepay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Compass Notes by giving the holder 30 days written notice. On March 21, 2014, the Trigger Event occurred. As a result, a holder of the Compass Notes could convert all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal amount of the Compass Notes into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1 share for every $4 in principal amount outstanding. In addition, ISG could elect to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Compass Notes by giving a holder 30 days written notice; however, such holder had to be given the opportunity to convert the outstanding principal amount into shares as described above. No holder of the Compass Notes had the ability to require cash payment as a result of the Trigger Event.\nOn December 1, 2016, as part of the merger consideration for the acquisition of Alsbridge, we issued an aggregate of $7.0 million in unsecured subordinated promissory notes (the Alsbridge Notes\u201d). The Alsbridge Notes mature on September 1, 2018 and interest accrues on the principal amount daily at a rate of 2.0% and is payable upon maturity. At any time, the Company may at its option prepay all or any portion of Alsbridge Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the total principal outstanding under the Alsbridge Notes was $7.0 million.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. The anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that may have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, either internally or through acquisition, we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure debt financing. The sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, and the timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods.\nPayments Due by Period\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt obligations, principal and interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n88,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $4.1 million as of December 31, 2017. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above because it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility are sufficient to finance the requirements of our business during future periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nThe Company sponsors a tax-qualified 401(k) plan with a profit sharing feature (the Savings Plan\u201d). The Savings Plan provides retirement benefits for participating employees. Participating employees can contribute a portion of their eligible salary on a pre-tax basis up to a maximum amount set by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2017, the maximum pre-tax contribution by an employee into the Savings Plan was $18,000, except for specified catch up contributions permitted by participants who are age 50 or older. The Company provides a match for those with less than 2 years of service of 50% of the first 6% that the employee contributes to the plan subject to a cap of $8,100 and for those with 2 or more years of service the company provides a match of 50% of the first 7% that the employee contributes to the plan subject to a cap of $9,450 in 2017. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we contributed $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, to the Plan. These amounts were invested by the participants in a variety of investment options under an arrangement with a third party asset manager. All current and future financial risks associated with the gains and losses on investments are borne by Savings Plan participants.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nThe negotiation of sourcing transactions and, as a result, our revenue and earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As a result of macro-economic factors and client budget and spending patterns, our revenues have\nhistorically been weighted toward the second half of each year. Our earnings track this revenue seasonality and are also impacted by the timing of the adoption of annual price increases and certain costs and, as a result, have historically been higher in the second half of each year. Due to the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results may differ from estimates. Such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates.\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d We have identified the following critical accounting estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize our revenues for the sale of services and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured.\nWe principally derive revenues from fees for services generated on a project-by-project basis. Prior to the commencement of a project, we reach agreement with the client on rates for services based upon the scope of the project, staffing requirements and the level of client involvement. It is our policy to obtain written agreements from new clients prior to performing services. In these agreements, the clients acknowledge that they will pay based upon the amount of time spent on the project or an agreed upon fee structure. Revenues for services rendered are recognized on a time and materials basis or on a fixed-fee or capped-fee basis in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.\nFees for services that have been performed, but for which we have not invoiced the customers, are recorded as unbilled receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenues from subscription contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the contract, which is generally one year. These fees are typically billed in advance and included in deferred revenue until recognized.\nRevenues for time and materials contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by our advisors at an agreed upon rate per hour and are recognized in the period in which services are performed. Revenues for time and materials contracts are billed monthly, semimonthly or in accordance with the specific contractual terms of each project.\nRevenues related to fixed-fee or capped-fee contracts are recognized into revenue as value is delivered to the customer. The pattern of revenue recognition for these contracts varies depending on the terms of the individual contracts, and may be recognized proportionally over the term of the contract or deferred until the end of the contract term and recognized when our obligations have been fulfilled with the customer. In instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in customer contracts, revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. The pattern of revenue recognition for contracts where revenues are recognized proportionally over the term of the contact is based on the proportional performance method of accounting using the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours, which we consider to be the best available indicator of the pattern and timing in which contract obligations are fulfilled. This percentage is multiplied by the contracted dollar amount of the project to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in an accounting period. The contracted amount used in this calculation typically excludes the amount the client pays for reimbursable expenses. There are situations where the number of hours to complete projects may exceed our original estimate as a result of an increase in project scope or unforeseen events. On a regular basis, we review the hours incurred and estimated total labor hours to complete. The results of any revisions in these estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known. We believe we have demonstrated a history of successfully estimating the total labor hours to complete a project.\nThe agreements entered into in connection with a project, whether on a time and materials basis or fixed-fee or capped-fee basis, typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with 30 days' notice. In the event of termination, the client is contractually required to pay for all time, materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination. In addition, from time to time, we enter into agreements with clients that limit our right to enter into business relationships with specific competitors of that client for a specific time period. These provisions typically prohibit us from performing a defined range of services that it might otherwise be willing to perform for potential clients. These provisions are generally limited to six to twelve months and usually apply only to specific employees or the specific project team.\nWe also derive revenues based on negotiating reductions in network costs of companies with the entity's related service providers and providing other services such as audits of network and communication expenses, and consultation for network architecture. These contracts can be fixed in fees or can be based on the level of savings achieved related to its communications costs. Additionally, these contracts can also have a fixed component and a contingent component that is based on the savings generated by the Company. For these contracts, we record the fixed fees using the milestone method of accounting such that revenues are recorded over the period of the delivery of the services. Revenues that are determined based on a percentage of the ultimate level of savings are considered earned and recorded as revenues when the work has been completed, and the savings and resulting revenues can be determined. We do not defer any costs incurred related to services which revenues are determined based on the ultimate savings. The contract periods range from a few months to in excess of a year.\nWe recognize revenues in advance of billing, those revenues are recorded as unbilled revenues. When we receive cash in advance of completing services or earning revenues, those amounts are recorded as unearned revenues.\nWe also enter into arrangements for the sale of robotics software licenses and related delivery of consulting services at the same time or within close proximity to one another. Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of software licenses, post contract support ( PCS\u201d), and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. We apply Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 985-605, Software Revenue\nRecognition to account for these arrangements. The PCS services are not accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Since vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of the license sale, PCS and other consulting service for the multiple element arrangements is not determinable and because licenses of the customer are one year in length, we record revenue for these arrangements in a straight line manner commencing after installation is complete, over the remaining term of the license.\nAccounts and Unbilled Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nOur trade receivables primarily consist of amounts due for services already performed via fixed fee or time and materials arrangements. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to pay fees or for disputes that affect its ability to fully collect billed accounts receivable. The allowance for these risks is prepared by reviewing the status of all accounts and recording reserves on a specific identification method based on previous experiences and historical bad debts. However, our actual experience may vary significantly from these estimates. If the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to pay their invoices, we may need to record additional allowances or write-offs in future periods. To the extent the provision relates to a client's inability or unwillingness to make required payments, the provision is recorded as bad debt expense, which is classified within selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nThe provision for unbilled services is recorded as a reduction to revenues to the extent the provision relates to fee adjustments and other discretionary pricing adjustments.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes, including recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax basis. We review our deferred tax assets for recovery. A valuation allowance is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change.\nFor uncertain tax positions, we use a prescribed model for assessing the financial recognition and measurement of all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns. This guidance provides clarification on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act\u201d) legislation was enacted. The TCJ Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and other changes. Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation was enacted. As such, we have accounted for the tax effects as a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act as of December 31, 2017.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually by applying a fair-value based test in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. This test is performed by us during our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators are present.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\" effective December 30, 2017 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, to be held and used by the Company are reviewed to determine whether any significant change in the long-lived asset's physical condition, a change in industry conditions or a reduction in cash flows associated with the use of the long-lived asset. If these or other factors indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is measured using market prices or, in the absence of market prices, an estimate of discounted cash flows. Cash flows are generally discounted at an interest rate commensurate with our weighted average cost of capital for a similar asset. Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria of accounting and disclosure requirement for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe grant restricted stock units with a fair value that is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Such grants generally vest ratably over a four-year period for employees and a three-year period for directors. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the applicable service period.\nWe follow the provisions of accounting and disclosures requirement for share-based payments, requiring the measurement and recognition of all share-based compensation under the fair value method.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed overview of ISG's financial condition, results of operations, and business strategies.

A trusted business partner to more than 700 clients, including 75 of the top 100 enterprises in the world, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations, and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Founded in 2006, and based in Stamford, Conn., ISG employs approximately 1,300 professionals operating in more than 20 countries-a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on our comprehensive marketplace data.\nOur strategy is to strengthen our existing market position and develop new services and products to support future growth plans. As a result, we are focused on growing our existing service model, expanding geographically, developing new industry sectors, productizing market data assets, expanding our managed services offerings and growing via acquisitions. Although we do not expect any adverse conditions that will impact our ability to execute against our strategy over the next twelve months, the more significant factors that could limit our ability to grow in these areas include global macro-economic conditions and the impact on the overall sourcing market, competition, our ability to retain advisors and reductions in discretionary spending with our top client accounts or other significant client events. Other areas that could impact the business would also include natural disasters, legislative and regulatory changes and capital market disruptions.\nWe derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services. A portion of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis. Clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. There are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services, often referred to as fixed fee billings. This may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions. We also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives. Such revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results. We also derive our revenues from recurring revenue streams. This includes Managed Services, Research, the U.S. Public Sector, subscription services around RPA and analytic benchmarking. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal centric as opposed to project centric revenue\nstreams) or multi-year contracts. Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of even our traditional transaction services. Digital enablement provides capabilities, digital insights and better engagement with clients and partners.\nOur results are impacted principally by our full-time consultants' utilization rate, the number of business days in each quarter and the number of our revenue-generating professionals who are available to work. Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that result in a temporary drop in our utilization rate. Our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients. The number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter. We typically have fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. Time-and-expense engagements do not provide us with a high degree of predictability as to performance in future periods. Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in utilization and revenues and present a challenge to optimal hiring and staffing. The volume of work performed for any particular client can vary widely from period to period.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFor ISG, 2017 will be remembered as the year of the combination and integration when we leveraged the power of our expanded portfolio of services to deliver more value to our clients, more opportunities for our employees and improved financial performance for our shareholders. Before the start of the year, we announced ISG was combining with Alsbridge to create a leading technology research, advisory and digital transformation services firm. ISG launched a new brand identity, website and mobile app during the first week of January 2017, allowing the firm to bring Alsbridge quickly under our brand umbrella and take advantage of our expanded digital marketing capabilities. We expanded our portfolio of service to include new capabilities in RPA, Network Services and Software Solutions; partnering with our clients to help shape the digital future of their business. We also saw strong demand from our clients for other new or expanded capabilities, including Network and Software Advisory services and Organizational Change Management ( OCM\u201d) services. The latter is particularly valuable to our clients as they transition their organizations and prepare their people for sweeping digital transformation programs.\nISG is in a unique position to help shape the digital future of business for its clients-both buyers and sellers of technology services. Since our founding more than 10 years ago, we have continued to evolve to meet the changing needs of our clients-transforming ourselves from a firm principally focused on sourcing advisory to one offering a full range of technology research, consulting, managed services and events aimed at helping clients digitally transform their operations for greater efficiency and faster growth.\nIn the age of digital business, every company, no matter how they started or where they are heading, is going to be a technology company. Technology decisions are no longer being left to the IT department. Increasingly, business leaders are deciding how to employ technology to develop new products and services; which workloads to move to the cloud; which business functions to automate; where and how to deploy the Internet of Things; how to leverage data analytics and cognitive computing; how to integrate the work of humans and bots; and how to improve collaboration in an increasingly decentralized operating environment. Every business is going to be run based on data, analytics, cognitive intelligence and enhancing customer experience through technology. That's going to require new levels of innovation, design thinking, automation and complete transformation of business models.\nIn addition to enterprise buyers, service providers that were not born digital are struggling to meet these changing dynamics. They have relied for a long time on a labor arbitrage model, providing human labor at lower cost. Now they must make investments in automation, cognitive computing and digital strategy while they struggle with margin pressure and mid-single-digit growth. And the largest of them face competition from a whole host of nimble, niche technology players, and from the likes of Google and Amazon that offer cloud computing capabilities that power IaaS and SaaS platforms.\nISG continues to invest in expanding its digital services, including cloud solutions, agile development, automation, data analytics and the Internet of Things. Our RPA business, is a strong source of growth, as clients rush to automate their back-office functions, even as they look to the future of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. Innovation also plays a strong role in our organic growth. We will continue to develop new capabilities based on market demand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nRevenues\nRevenues are generally derived from fixed fee contracts as well as engagements priced on a time and materials basis which are recorded based on actual time worked as the services are performed. In addition, from time to time, we also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones. Revenues related to materials (mainly out-of-pocket expenses such as airfare, lodging and meals) required during an engagement generally do not include a profit mark-up and can be charged and reimbursed separately or as part of the overall fee arrangement. Invoices are issued to clients monthly, semimonthly or in accordance with the specific contractual terms of each project.\nWe operate in one segment, fact-based sourcing advisory services. We operate principally in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our foreign operations are subject to local government regulations and to the uncertainties of the economic and political conditions of those areas, and the revenue for our foreign operations is predominantly collected in local currency.\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\n\nRevenues increased $53.1 million or approximately 25% in 2017. The increase in revenues in the Americas region was primarily attributable to higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily associated with the acquisitions of TracePoint and Alsbridge in 2016. The increase in the Europe region was primarily attributable to a higher level of sourcing activity in our Consulting line of business, primarily associated\nwith the acquisition of Alsbridge and increased sourcing revenue in Germany. The impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars did not have a material impact on revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\n\nTotal operating expenses increased $41.3 million for 2017 with increases in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits of $30.2 million, $5.6 million in travel, $1.1 million in professional fees, $0.6 million in information technology and $0.4 million in stock compensation expense. During 2017, we recorded $0.6 million for the loss on the sublease of Alsbridge's headquarters office. The increases were also due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. We recorded $7.4 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $7.0 million in 2016. In 2017, we also recorded $0.5 million related to the reversal of a tax indemnity receivable established with an unrealized tax benefit liability at the time of the acquisition of Alsbridge. The associated unrealized tax benefit liability was also reversed and recorded as a reduction in the tax provision. These cost increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in contract labor costs. SG&A costs in 2017 also included $2.3 million associated with acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense, compared to $6.3 million in 2016.\nCompensation costs consist of a mix of fixed and variable salaries, annual bonuses, benefits and retirement plan contributions. Statutory and 401(k) plans are offered to employees as appropriate. Direct costs also include employee taxes, health insurance, workers compensation and disability insurance.\nA portion of compensation expenses for certain billable employees are allocated between direct costs and selling, general and administrative costs based on relative time spent between billable and non-billable activities.\nSelling costs consist principally of compensation expense related to business development, proposal preparation and delivery, and negotiation of new client contracts. Selling costs also include travel expenses relating to the pursuit of sales opportunities, expenses for hosting periodic client conferences, public relations activities, participation in industry conferences, industry relations, website maintenance and business intelligence activities. Additionally, we maintain a dedicated global marketing function responsible for developing and managing sales campaigns, brand promotion, the ISG Index and assembling client proposals.\nWe maintain a comprehensive program for training and professional development with the related costs included in SG&A. Related expenses include product training, updates on new service offerings or methodologies and development of client project management skills. Also included in training and professional\ndevelopment are expenses associated with the development, enhancement and maintenance of our proprietary methodologies and tools and the systems that support them.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of executive management compensation, allocations of billable employee compensation related to general management activities, IT infrastructure, and costs for the finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative costs also reflect continued investment associated with implementing and operating client and employee management systems. Because our billable personnel operate primarily on client premises, all occupancy expenses are recorded as general and administrative.\nDepreciation expense in 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Amortization expense in 2017 and 2016 was $9.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million and $3.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal-use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nWe amortize our intangible assets (e.g., client relationships and databases) over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, trademark and trade names related to acquisitions are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing.\nOther (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\n\nThe total increase of $4.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.2 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2017 of $4.2 million as compared to $1.1 million for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 199.9% compared to (19.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the current year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act\u201d). The effective tax rate of the Company without the TCJ\nAct would have been 101.3% for the year. The increased rate for the year without the TCJ Act was primarily driven by our inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits and shortfalls on restricted stock awards.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\n\nRevenues increased $7.3 million or approximately 3% in 2016. The increase in revenues in the Americas region was primarily attributable to higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily associated with the acquisition of TracePoint and Alsbridge. The increase in revenues in the Asia Pacific region was primarily attributable to higher levels of Managed Services and higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting. The decrease in the Europe region was primarily attributable to lower levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily in the United Kingdom offset by higher levels of Research Services, primarily associated with the acquisition of Experton Group.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\n\nTotal operating expenses increased $19.5 million for 2016 with increases in SG&A expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits, contract labor, professional fees, interest on contingent consideration, stock compensation expense and travel expenses. We recorded $7.0 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $5.0 million in 2015. The increases were also due to the acquisition of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense of $6.3 million, were also included in selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 also included $0.4 million in transaction costs associated with our stock repurchase conducted through a\nmodified Dutch\u201d auction. These cost increases were partially offset by decreases in occupancy, conferences and bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in 2016 and 2015 was $7.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase of $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\n\nThe total increase of $1.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.4 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by losses associated with forward contracts that were used to hedge ISG's forecasted 2016 quarterly earnings recorded in Euro versus foreign currency gains in 2015 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2016 of $1.1 million as compared to $3.2 million for 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (19.8%) compared to 39.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of current year overall Company losses effect on the effective tax rate computation combined with increases in changes in valuation allowances placed against deferred tax assets and non-deductible expenses incurred in 2016.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nThis management's discussion and analysis presents supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information but are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We refer to these financial measures, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures\u201d under SEC rules, as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each as defined below. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for information about our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including\nthese measures and reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We provide adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income before net income attributable to non-controlling interest plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense, tax indemnity receivable, and bargain purchase gain), adjusted net income (defined as net income plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense and bargain purchase gain, on a tax-adjusted basis) and adjusted net income as earnings per diluted share, excluding the net of tax effect of the items set forth in the table below. These are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG's core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to evaluate the Company's business strategies and management's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company's performance.\n\n \n\n\n________________________________________\n(1)Consists of expenses from acquisition-related costs and non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues.\n(2)Marginal tax rate of 38% applied.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued payroll and related benefits. The volume of billings and timing of collections and payments affect these account balances.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nAs of December 31,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with Item 6 Selected Financial Data\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a)(1). In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements must be understood in the context of numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described previously in section 1A Risk Factors.\u201d\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nISG (Information Services Group) ( ISG\u201d) (Nasdaq: III) is a leading global technology research and advisory firm. A trusted business partner to more than 700 clients, including 75 of the top 100 enterprises in the world, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations, and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Founded in 2006, and based in Stamford, Conn., ISG employs approximately 1,300 professionals operating in more than 20 countries-a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on our comprehensive marketplace data.\nOur strategy is to strengthen our existing market position and develop new services and products to support future growth plans. As a result, we are focused on growing our existing service model, expanding geographically, developing new industry sectors, productizing market data assets, expanding our managed services offerings and growing via acquisitions. Although we do not expect any adverse conditions that will impact our ability to execute against our strategy over the next twelve months, the more significant factors that could limit our ability to grow in these areas include global macro-economic conditions and the impact on the overall sourcing market, competition, our ability to retain advisors and reductions in discretionary spending with our top client accounts or other significant client events. Other areas that could impact the business would also include natural disasters, legislative and regulatory changes and capital market disruptions.\nWe derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services. A portion of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis. Clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. There are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services, often referred to as fixed fee billings. This may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions. We also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives. Such revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results. We also derive our revenues from recurring revenue streams. This includes Managed Services, Research, the U.S. Public Sector, subscription services around RPA and analytic benchmarking. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal centric as opposed to project centric revenue\nstreams) or multi-year contracts. Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of even our traditional transaction services. Digital enablement provides capabilities, digital insights and better engagement with clients and partners.\nOur results are impacted principally by our full-time consultants' utilization rate, the number of business days in each quarter and the number of our revenue-generating professionals who are available to work. Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that result in a temporary drop in our utilization rate. Our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients. The number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter. We typically have fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. Time-and-expense engagements do not provide us with a high degree of predictability as to performance in future periods. Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in utilization and revenues and present a challenge to optimal hiring and staffing. The volume of work performed for any particular client can vary widely from period to period.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFor ISG, 2017 will be remembered as the year of the combination and integration when we leveraged the power of our expanded portfolio of services to deliver more value to our clients, more opportunities for our employees and improved financial performance for our shareholders. Before the start of the year, we announced ISG was combining with Alsbridge to create a leading technology research, advisory and digital transformation services firm. ISG launched a new brand identity, website and mobile app during the first week of January 2017, allowing the firm to bring Alsbridge quickly under our brand umbrella and take advantage of our expanded digital marketing capabilities. We expanded our portfolio of service to include new capabilities in RPA, Network Services and Software Solutions; partnering with our clients to help shape the digital future of their business. We also saw strong demand from our clients for other new or expanded capabilities, including Network and Software Advisory services and Organizational Change Management ( OCM\u201d) services. The latter is particularly valuable to our clients as they transition their organizations and prepare their people for sweeping digital transformation programs.\nISG is in a unique position to help shape the digital future of business for its clients-both buyers and sellers of technology services. Since our founding more than 10 years ago, we have continued to evolve to meet the changing needs of our clients-transforming ourselves from a firm principally focused on sourcing advisory to one offering a full range of technology research, consulting, managed services and events aimed at helping clients digitally transform their operations for greater efficiency and faster growth.\nIn the age of digital business, every company, no matter how they started or where they are heading, is going to be a technology company. Technology decisions are no longer being left to the IT department. Increasingly, business leaders are deciding how to employ technology to develop new products and services; which workloads to move to the cloud; which business functions to automate; where and how to deploy the Internet of Things; how to leverage data analytics and cognitive computing; how to integrate the work of humans and bots; and how to improve collaboration in an increasingly decentralized operating environment. Every business is going to be run based on data, analytics, cognitive intelligence and enhancing customer experience through technology. That's going to require new levels of innovation, design thinking, automation and complete transformation of business models.\nIn addition to enterprise buyers, service providers that were not born digital are struggling to meet these changing dynamics. They have relied for a long time on a labor arbitrage model, providing human labor at lower cost. Now they must make investments in automation, cognitive computing and digital strategy while they struggle with margin pressure and mid-single-digit growth. And the largest of them face competition from a whole host of nimble, niche technology players, and from the likes of Google and Amazon that offer cloud computing capabilities that power IaaS and SaaS platforms.\nISG continues to invest in expanding its digital services, including cloud solutions, agile development, automation, data analytics and the Internet of Things. Our RPA business, is a strong source of growth, as clients rush to automate their back-office functions, even as they look to the future of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. Innovation also plays a strong role in our organic growth. We will continue to develop new capabilities based on market demand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nRevenues\nRevenues are generally derived from fixed fee contracts as well as engagements priced on a time and materials basis which are recorded based on actual time worked as the services are performed. In addition, from time to time, we also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings, which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones. Revenues related to materials (mainly out-of-pocket expenses such as airfare, lodging and meals) required during an engagement generally do not include a profit mark-up and can be charged and reimbursed separately or as part of the overall fee arrangement. Invoices are issued to clients monthly, semimonthly or in accordance with the specific contractual terms of each project.\nWe operate in one segment, fact-based sourcing advisory services. We operate principally in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our foreign operations are subject to local government regulations and to the uncertainties of the economic and political conditions of those areas, and the revenue for our foreign operations is predominantly collected in local currency.\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeographic Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n161,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n45,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n269,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $53.1 million or approximately 25% in 2017. The increase in revenues in the Americas region was primarily attributable to higher levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily associated with the acquisitions of TracePoint and Alsbridge in 2016. The increase in the Europe region was primarily attributable to a higher level of sourcing activity in our Consulting line of business, primarily associated\nwith the acquisition of Alsbridge and increased sourcing revenue in Germany. The impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars did not have a material impact on revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect costs and expenses for advisors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n156,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n91,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n260,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $41.3 million for 2017 with increases in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits of $30.2 million, $5.6 million in travel, $1.1 million in professional fees, $0.6 million in information technology and $0.4 million in stock compensation expense. During 2017, we recorded $0.6 million for the loss on the sublease of Alsbridge's headquarters office. The increases were also due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. We recorded $7.4 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $7.0 million in 2016. In 2017, we also recorded $0.5 million related to the reversal of a tax indemnity receivable established with an unrealized tax benefit liability at the time of the acquisition of Alsbridge. The associated unrealized tax benefit liability was also reversed and recorded as a reduction in the tax provision. These cost increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in contract labor costs. SG&A costs in 2017 also included $2.3 million associated with acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense, compared to $6.3 million in 2016.\nCompensation costs consist of a mix of fixed and variable salaries, annual bonuses, benefits and retirement plan contributions. Statutory and 401(k) plans are offered to employees as appropriate. Direct costs also include employee taxes, health insurance, workers compensation and disability insurance.\nA portion of compensation expenses for certain billable employees are allocated between direct costs and selling, general and administrative costs based on relative time spent between billable and non-billable activities.\nSelling costs consist principally of compensation expense related to business development, proposal preparation and delivery, and negotiation of new client contracts. Selling costs also include travel expenses relating to the pursuit of sales opportunities, expenses for hosting periodic client conferences, public relations activities, participation in industry conferences, industry relations, website maintenance and business intelligence activities. Additionally, we maintain a dedicated global marketing function responsible for developing and managing sales campaigns, brand promotion, the ISG Index and assembling client proposals.\nWe maintain a comprehensive program for training and professional development with the related costs included in SG&A. Related expenses include product training, updates on new service offerings or methodologies and development of client project management skills. Also included in training and professional\ndevelopment are expenses associated with the development, enhancement and maintenance of our proprietary methodologies and tools and the systems that support them.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of executive management compensation, allocations of billable employee compensation related to general management activities, IT infrastructure, and costs for the finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative costs also reflect continued investment associated with implementing and operating client and employee management systems. Because our billable personnel operate primarily on client premises, all occupancy expenses are recorded as general and administrative.\nDepreciation expense in 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Amortization expense in 2017 and 2016 was $9.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million and $3.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal-use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nWe amortize our intangible assets (e.g., client relationships and databases) over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, trademark and trade names related to acquisitions are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing.\nOther (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,821)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,157)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(156)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(343)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(248)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(261)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,057)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,732)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,325)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(158)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total increase of $4.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.2 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2017 of $4.2 million as compared to $1.1 million for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 199.9% compared to (19.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the current year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJ Act\u201d). The effective tax rate of the Company without the TCJ\nAct would have been 101.3% for the year. The increased rate for the year without the TCJ Act was primarily driven by our inability to fully utilize foreign tax credits and shortfalls on restricted stock awards.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nRevenues\nGeographical information for the segment is as follows:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeographic Area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n108,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,632)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $7.3 million or approximately 3% in 2016.

The decrease in the Europe region was primarily attributable to lower levels of sourcing activity in Consulting, primarily in the United Kingdom offset by higher levels of Research Services, primarily associated with the acquisition of Experton Group.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect costs and expenses for advisors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n124,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n219,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n199,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $19.5 million for 2016 with increases in SG&A expenses, direct expenses and depreciation and amortization. The increases were due primarily to higher compensation and benefits, contract labor, professional fees, interest on contingent consideration, stock compensation expense and travel expenses. We recorded $7.0 million of stock compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, compared to $5.0 million in 2015. The increases were also due to the acquisition of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Acquisition-related costs and severance and integration expense of $6.3 million, were also included in selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2016 also included $0.4 million in transaction costs associated with our stock repurchase conducted through a\nmodified Dutch\u201d auction. These cost increases were partially offset by decreases in occupancy, conferences and bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in 2016 and 2015 was $7.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase of $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisitions of TracePoint, Experton and Alsbridge. Depreciation expense is generally computed by applying the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. We also capitalize some costs associated with the purchase and development of internal use software, system conversions and website development costs. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or system.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents a breakdown of other (expense), net:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,664)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,789)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(875)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(49)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(398)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(131)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,732)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,472)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,260)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(86)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total increase of $1.3 million was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher debt balances. The change of $0.4 million of foreign currency losses was principally driven by losses associated with forward contracts that were used to hedge ISG's forecasted 2016 quarterly earnings recorded in Euro versus foreign currency gains in 2015 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate varies from period to period based on the mix of earnings among the various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which business is conducted and the level of non-deductible expenses incurred in any given period. We recorded an income tax provision for 2016 of $1.1 million as compared to $3.2 million for 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (19.8%) compared to 39.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of current year overall Company losses effect on the effective tax rate computation combined with increases in changes in valuation allowances placed against deferred tax assets and non-deductible expenses incurred in 2016.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nThis management's discussion and analysis presents supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information but are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We refer to these financial measures, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures\u201d under SEC rules, as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, each as defined below. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for information about our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including\nthese measures and reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We provide adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income before net income attributable to non-controlling interest plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense, tax indemnity receivable, and bargain purchase gain), adjusted net income (defined as net income plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, change in contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, severance and integration expense and bargain purchase gain, on a tax-adjusted basis) and adjusted net income as earnings per diluted share, excluding the net of tax effect of the items set forth in the table below. These are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG's core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to evaluate the Company's business strategies and management's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company's performance.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
