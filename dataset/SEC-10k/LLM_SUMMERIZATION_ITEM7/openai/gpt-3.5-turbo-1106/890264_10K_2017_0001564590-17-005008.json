In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, including but not limited to those set forth in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe develop, sell and support simulation software and services used primarily by vehicle manufacturers to enhance the performance of their products, reduce product development costs and improve the efficiency of their design and engineering processes. Our solutions enable our customers to augment or replace inefficient and expensive methods of evaluating alternative designs, such as wind tunnel testing using physical prototypes, with accurate digital simulations that are more useful and timely. We believe, based on feedback from our customers and data published by them, that use of our software solutions enables significant cost savings and fundamental improvements in their vehicle development process by allowing their engineers and designers to gain crucial insights about design performance early in the design cycle.\nOur core product, PowerFLOW\u00ae, is an innovative software solution for simulating complex fluid flow problems, including aerodynamics, thermal management, and aeroacoustics, or wind noise. PowerFLOW relies upon our proprietary technology that we refer to as Digital Physics\u00ae, which is based on algorithms known as the lattice Boltzmann method. Our proprietary technology enables PowerFLOW to predict complex fluid flows with a level of reliability comparable to or better than physical testing, with results that are more accurate and useful than those of alternative computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, methods.\nWe currently focus primarily on the ground transportation market, including manufacturers in the passenger vehicle, highway truck, off-highway vehicle and train markets, as well as their suppliers. Over 150 manufacturers currently utilize our products and services, including the top 15 global passenger vehicle manufacturers. This data is based on motor vehicle production volume for 2015, as reported by the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles, or the International Organization of Vehicle Manufacturers. Global vehicle manufacturers face increasing pressure, from government mandates as well as from consumers, to improve the efficiency of their products. This requires different powertrain choices, changes in the shape of the vehicle, and reductions in vehicle weight, all of which we believe favor the adoption of simulation-driven design.\nWe continue to expand our offerings in the aerospace and oil and gas production markets and explore other markets in which we believe the capabilities of PowerFLOW have broad application, such as the chemical processing, architecture engineering and construction, power generation, biomedical and electronics industries. The investment in our aerospace vertical business has increased our domain and portfolio of new applications. We have built a customer base of airframe, jet engine and supply manufacturers. We also recently announced the commercial launch and license of our product for use in the oil and gas production market.\nWe offer our solutions through annual capacity-based licenses, either as software-only, to be run on the customer's own computer hardware, or in the form of software-as-a-service, via our hosted ExaCLOUD offerings. We sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force, including sales executives and applications engineering teams deployed near our customers in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea and China, through a distributor in India and through a sales agent in Brazil.\nWe have a predictable business model based on recurring revenue from a growing customer base. For fiscal year 2017, we recorded total revenues, net loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $72.6 million, $(1.1) million and $6.5 million, respectively, as compared to $65.4 million, $4.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal year 2016. Since generating our first commercial revenue in 1994, our annual revenue has increased for 22 consecutive years.\nDuring the twelve months ended January 31, 2017, revenue growth was driven by continued deployment of our simulation solutions with our existing customer base as well as by the addition of new customers. We believe that our continued investments in field resources yield growth in both project and license revenue over time. While our geographic mix of revenue outside of the Americas during fiscal year 2017 was consistent with historical trends, the weakening U.S. dollar, particularly against the yen, had a material positive impact on revenue performance for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, 74% of our revenue came from outside of the Americas as compared to 71% for fiscal year 2016. Revenue growth for fiscal year 2017 was 10.9% over the same period a year ago and 9.0% when measured on a constant currency basis.\nIn the last two months of fiscal year 2017, we experienced increased caution regarding growth and deployment initiatives from our ground transportation customers, which impacted our incremental growth on some renewal orders. We attributed this to our\ncustomers anticipating the impact of changes in the tax, trade and regulatory frameworks within which they operate. Based on renewal activity during this period, we expect that this will have an impact on revenue over the next fiscal year. In addition, as we have experienced on a limited basis in the past, we had a significantly reduced renewal commitment that will impact revenue and growth in the next fiscal year.\nThroughout the last decade the market has increasingly recognized the benefits of the lattice Boltzmann-based CFD method to extend digital simulation possibilities. We have observed increased customer interest in not only Exa's proprietary lattice Boltzmann technology, but also in alternative commercial, open source and in-house codes. We believe that the increased market awareness of the lattice Boltzmann method is a positive trend for our product offering in the long run due to our technical leadership, intellectual property and experience with this technology.\nAdjusted EBITDA and revenue on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue on a constant currency basis, and explanation of our management's use of these measures and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, please see - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\nAs a percent of revenue, our total operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased approximately 4.7% when compared to the same period last year. This decrease is a result of our prior investments in resources to drive top line growth, including sales, marketing and research and development. While the majority of our expense base is in the United States, we have field resources based in our international offices which provide some natural foreign exchange hedge. As a result, the weakening dollar had a negative impact on total operating expenses when compared to the same period last year. For fiscal year 2017, total operating expenses were $72.2 million, with growth of 5.9% over the prior year and 5.7% when measured on a constant currency basis. See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for information about how we calculate and use operating expenses on a constant currency basis.\nAs a percent of revenue, our income from operations for fiscal year 2017 was 0.5% compared with our loss from operations of 4.2% for fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of cost-saving initiatives during fiscal year 2017 and the foreign currency impacts described above.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million compared to $27.6 million as of January 31, 2016. The strong cash balance reflects strong accounts receivable collections activity and normal seasonal cash flows. Capital expenditures increased by $1.8 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to a $3.7 million investment in server equipment for our new high performance computing data center located in Virginia.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers' purchases of our software products. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their budget cycles, which typically coincide with the calendar year, except in Japan, where our customers' budget cycle typically begins on April 1. Because our software products are sold pursuant to annual subscription agreements and we recognize revenue from these subscriptions over the term of the agreement, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. However, these seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as we generally receive the annual license fee at the time the license term commences, or shortly thereafter. As a result, our cash flows from operations are typically highest in the first quarter of each fiscal year.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods presented, data from our consolidated statements of operation, as well as that data as a percentage of revenues. The information contained in these tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 119:

The $7.3 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of new license customers throughout the year. Deployment continues to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets. Project revenue decreased by $0.2 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, which reflects our slowed investment in project capacity in fiscal year 2017, and we anticipate continued fluctuations in project revenue growth into fiscal year 2018. However, our project delivery capability continues to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth. Both license and project revenue, particularly new customer opportunities, are leveraging the capabilities of our ExaCLOUD platform. Virtually all of our projects are now being delivered using ExaCLOUD exposing our customers to its capabilities. ExaCLOUD continues to play an increasingly important role in our new customer acquisition go-to-market model.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the Japanese yen, positively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2017 by $1.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2016. On a constant currency basis, our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 increased 9.0%, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nCost of revenues\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (690\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenues for fiscal year 2017 was $19.4 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3.4%, compared with $20.1 million during fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 26.8% for fiscal year 2017 from 30.7% for fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decrease in cost of revenues was driven by decreased personnel-related costs of approximately $1.3 million associated with a change in headcount mix and lower stock-based compensations, along with a $0.2 million decrease in hosting fees driven by savings from an amended hosting agreement at our high performance computing data center in New Jersey. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty costs and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation expense related to investments made to increase computing capacity.\nSales and marketing\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 36.5% compared with $10.2 million for fiscal year 2016.

The provision for both periods primarily consists of the tax effects of foreign operating results with foreign withholding taxes.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we determined that the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets were no longer more-likely-than-not realizable. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax provision of $14.4 million to establish a full valuation allowance on the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets. In determining the realizability of these assets, we considered numerous factors including historical profitability, estimated future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the industry in which we operate. Through the three months ended April 30, 2015, our results reflected a three-year cumulative loss position in the United States; prior thereto, our historical results reflected a three-year cumulative profit. Reflecting management's plans to continue investing in the business for future growth, we continued in a three-year cumulative loss position through the remainder of fiscal year 2015 and 2016. This historical loss position at April 30, 2015 and projected cumulative loss position resulted in significant negative evidence which caused management to modify its assessment of our deferred tax assets, concluding that it no longer was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized and thus, a valuation allowance was necessary against the full amount of our United States net deferred tax assets. Most of our revenues are generated from ground transportation customers outside the United States but a significantly disproportionate amount of our operating expenses, including investments in future products, are incurred in the United States, causing the results of operations in the United States to reflect losses during this period of investment.\nOur management reassesses the realization of the deferred tax assets each reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of our United States operations improve in the future and the deferred tax assets become realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowance through earnings.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset our United States federal taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a three-year period. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, management determined that we had experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382. This ownership change resulted in annual limitations to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit was approximately $14.0 million for fiscal year 2015, $16.8 million for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2019, $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020 and $6.4 million for each fiscal year thereafter. The ownership change also resulted in the loss of our ability to utilize essentially all state net operating loss carryforwards, credits and other state attributes, which resulted in a write-off of $0.8 million of state deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2015.\nWe do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly within the next twelve months. We and one or more of our subsidiaries file United States federal income tax returns and tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, local or foreign examinations for years prior to January 31, 2012. However, carryforward attributes that were generated prior to January 31, 2013 may still be adjusted upon examination by state or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Project revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenue increased 7.6% from $49.7 million in fiscal year 2015 to $53.5 million in fiscal year 2016. The $3.8 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of 17 new license customers. Deployment continued to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets and in our North America passenger automotive customer base. Project revenue increased $0.3 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to expanded sales and greater activity with existing customers. We anticipated less project revenue growth in fiscal year 2016 as our investment in project capacity has slowed. But our project delivery capability continued to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the weakness of the Euro and the Japanese yen, negatively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2016 by $5.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2015.

The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of our liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled or used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\nRevenue and total operating expenses on a constant currency basis. Our international operations generate revenue and incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in currency exchange rates can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. Our principal exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the United States dollar versus the British pound, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen, and Korean won. To provide investors with information concerning underlying trends in our business, we disclose revenue and total operating expenses on a constant currency basis, which we define as GAAP revenue or operating expenses, adjusted to reverse the impact of changes in the exchange rates of the principal currencies in which our international operations generated revenue and incurred expenses. We calculate revenue and total operating expenses on a constant currency basis by converting revenue or operating expenses that were generated in the currencies specified above during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 to United States dollars at assumed exchange rates equal to the exchange rates in effect for such currencies during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, rather than the exchange rates actually in effect during the current fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, excluding non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. We define EBITDA as net loss, excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, other income, net, foreign exchange gain (loss) and provision for income taxes. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net loss.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP operating income (loss) excluding non-cash, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP operating income (loss) is operating income (loss).\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net loss as GAAP net loss excluding the after-tax impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) is net loss.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. We define non-GAAP net loss per diluted share as GAAP net loss per diluted share excluding the after-tax impact of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share is net loss per diluted share.\nOur management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. By excluding material non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, we believe that these measures more clearly reflect the underlying trends in our business, are useful for comparing current results with prior period results, and are helpful to investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance. For example, our management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of our operational strength and the performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. However, each of these non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as an analytical tool. In considering our Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per diluted share, investors should take into account the following reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Our primary uses of cash during the fiscal year 2017 were capital expenditures and payments of capital lease obligations. As of January 31, 2017, we had $24.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nNet Cash Flows provided by (used in) Operating Activities\nVariations in the amount of our net cash provided by or used in operating activities are primarily the result of changes in the amount of our working capital accounts, mainly accounts receivable and deferred revenue, the timing of cash payments from our customers and of our cash expenditures, principally employee salaries, accounts payable and payments of value added taxes and consumption taxes on the receivables of our foreign subsidiaries.\nCash payments from our customers fluctuate due to timing of new and renewal license sales, which typically coincide with our customers' budget cycles. The fourth quarter of each fiscal year generally has the highest license sales, with payment of the license fee becoming due at the commencement of the license term. As a result, our cash flows from operations are typically highest in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Generally, customers are invoiced in advance for their annual subscription fee and the invoices are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, with deferred revenues being recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement.\nFor fiscal year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.9 million and was primarily the result of fluctuations in working capital, including a decrease in accounts receivable and a decrease in deferred revenue. Accounts receivable and deferred revenue typically fluctuate depending on the timing of when customer orders are received by the Company and invoiced to customers and the timing of cash payments from the customers. During fiscal year 2017, we received fewer cash payments at the end of the period, resulting in a decrease in cash provided by operating activities over the prior year period. In addition, our accounts payable and accrued expense balances decreased over the prior year, due to the timing of cash settlements, which also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities.\nFor fiscal year 2016, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $10.0 million and was primarily the result of fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in deferred revenue of $10.5 million. Deferred revenue and accounts receivable typically fluctuate depending on the timing of when customer orders are received by and invoiced to customers and the timing of cash payments from the customers. During fiscal year 2016, we received cash payments from one large customer in Germany for both its 2016 and 2017 license orders, resulting in a substantial increase in cash provided by operating activities over the prior year period. In addition, our accounts payable and accrued expense balances increased over the prior year, due to the timing of cash settlements, and this also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities.\nFor fiscal year 2015, net cash used in operating activities totaled $3.1 million and was primarily the result of decreased profitability and fluctuations in working capital, including a decrease in deferred revenue of $3.4 million. As of the end of fiscal year 2014, one large customer in Germany had ordered and fully paid for a subscription license that ran through fiscal year 2015. As of January 31, 2015, this customer was still negotiating with us and had not placed or paid for a full year license order for the upcoming year. This had the impact of a significant decrease in deferred revenue but no fluctuation in accounts receivable for this customer in fiscal year 2015.\nNet Cash Flows used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $4.1 million, $2.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and relates primarily to purchases of furniture and fixtures, servers, workstations, and other computer software and equipment to support the growth in our business operations. For fiscal year 2017, capitalized equipment costs for our new data center accounted for the majority of the cash outflows. In fiscal year 2016, capitalized renovations to our Burlington, Massachusetts headquarters office accounted for the majority of the cash outflows, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash as a result of the release of a portion of our required security deposit letter of credit in connection with the amendment of our corporate headquarters lease. In fiscal year 2015, cash outflows were primarily related to purchases of computer and software equipment.\nNet Cash Flows used in Financing Activities\nFor fiscal year 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million, which consisted primarily of payments on our capital lease obligations of $2.8 million and partially offset by $0.9 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nFor fiscal year 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1.8 million, which consisted primarily of payments on our capital lease obligations of $3.0 million, which was partially offset by $1.2 million in proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises.\nFor fiscal year 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million, which consisted primarily of payments on our capital lease obligations of $2.8 million, which was partially offset by $0.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 31, 2017 or 2016.\nContractual Commitments\nOur contractual obligations as of January 31, 2017 are summarized below:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease and hosting obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes scheduled interest payments of less than $0.1 million in each of fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual obligations table above does not include $0.1 million of net unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2017, as we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, in-process research and development and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments, assumptions and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues from the licensing of our software products, typically in the form of one-year term subscription\u201d or capacity-based licenses that have a defined term, and from project fees for consulting services and training. Licenses for our software products may be software to be run on the customer's own computer hardware, or provided in the form of software-as-a-service via our hosted ExaCLOUD offering.\nSoftware\nWe recognize revenues from licensing our software products in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition. Term licenses typically have a term of one year and allow the customer to buy simulation in the form of a limited amount of\nsimulation capacity on customer installed software and are sold based upon simulation capacity expected to be used within a certain time period-typically not exceeding one year.\nWe typically sell term and capacity-based software licenses combined in a bundled sale. For instance, when customers purchase simulation capacity, they typically also purchase a number of term-based licenses for preparation and analysis software. All of our software licenses include multiple elements such as maintenance and support. Pursuant to the guidance within ASC 985-605, we have determined that since we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the individual elements contained in a bundled sale of term and capacity-based software licenses, the arrangement is treated as a single unit of accounting and revenue is recognized ratably on a daily basis over the term of the license agreement, which coincides with the duration of the maintenance and support services. Our arrangements typically do not include rights to carryover any unused capacity beyond the contractual license term or any customer right of return.\nLicenses have finite terms that are not extendible at their expiration, and capacity usage is limited by contract to the amount specified. Our practice is not to modify existing capacity-based licenses to allow simulation capacity to be added to an existing arrangement. A customer desiring to purchase additional simulation capacity or to license additional users of our preparation and analysis software during the term of the original simulation license does so by entering into a separate arrangement. Revenue from these new arrangements is recognized over the term of the new agreements, which include bundled maintenance and support, and are for a term of less than twelve months, coterminous with the remaining term of the original simulation license.\nWe commence recognition of term license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery of the software or license keys has occurred and all service elements, if bundled or linked, have commenced; price is fixed or determinable; and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable by management. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are treated as deferred revenue.\nIf training or consulting service projects are bundled with a software license sale or, as a result of specific facts and circumstances, are determined to be linked with a software license sale, we treat this as one arrangement and recognize revenue ratably on a daily basis over the license period provided that delivery of all elements of the arrangement have commenced.\nSoftware as a service (ExaCLOUD)\nWe recognize revenue from software-as-a-service arrangements in accordance with ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition. Capacity-based licenses allow the customer to buy simulation capacity as a service hosted by us and are sold based upon simulation capacity expected to be used within a certain time period-typically not exceeding one year. The contracts have finite terms that are not extendible at their expiration, and capacity usage is limited by contract to the amount specified. Our practice is not to modify existing capacity-based licenses to allow simulation capacity to be added to an existing arrangement. A customer desiring to purchase additional simulation capacity or to license additional users of our preparation and analysis software during the term of the original simulation license must do so by entering into a separate arrangement. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the capacity is used. In the event that any capacity remains unused at the end of the term of the arrangement, it is recognized as revenue at that time. With the ExaCLOUD solution, customers have access to hosted simulation capacity as well as hosted preparation and analysis software through a web browser. The ExaCLOUD solution includes a pay-as-you-use\u201d model and an option to purchase a block of simulation capacity upfront to be used over a defined period - typically not exceeding one year. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the cloud hosting service is provided.\nProjects\nWe also derive revenue from fees for separate, project-based services. Our projects are typically short-term in nature and usually complete in less than 90 days. Project pricing is generally either fixed fee or time and material based. We recognize revenue from these service arrangements in accordance with ASC 605. Projects are either sold as one deliverable, or as multiple deliverables with stand-alone value. For single deliverable projects, to the extent that adequate project reporting of time incurred and time to complete records exist, we recognize consulting services revenue as the services are performed under the proportionate performance method. In other situations, for example, providing a customer with an on-site engineer for a defined period of time to provide services at the customer's direction, we recognize revenue ratably over the service period. In situations where we are unable to utilize the proportional performance method, for example due to either the lack of adequate documentation of time incurred or to be incurred or a lack of a defined service period, revenue is deferred until the contract is completed.\nFor projects which have multiple deliverables, each with stand-alone value, we recognize revenue based on ASC 605 and allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables. For our project deliverables, we use best estimated selling price ( BESP\u201d) as our selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d) do not exist. If each deliverable does not have stand-alone value, the project is then deemed to be a single unit of accounting.\nMultiple element arrangements\nMultiple element arrangements may include customer rights to any combination of software, project deliverables, software as a service, maintenance and training.\nWhen more than one element is contained in a single arrangement, we first allocate total arrangement revenue based upon relative selling prices into two categories: (1) non-software components, such as services under projects not related to software licenses or software-as-a-service and (2) software components, such as software licenses, maintenance and support, and other software-related services.\nRevenue allocated to non-software services is recognized based on ASC 605 and the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the relative selling price of the deliverables. For non-software deliverables, we use our best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) if vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) or third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d) do not exist.\nRevenue allocated to products sold which meet the definition of software components is recognized based on software accounting guidance provided for in ASC 985-605. Under this guidance, residual method is used to recognize revenue when a multiple element arrangement includes one or more software related elements to be delivered at a future date and VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements exists (typically maintenance and other services), but does not exist for the delivered elements (typically the software). However, since we cannot establish VSOE for our undelivered elements, the entire software arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract (maintenance) period. This particularly includes our term-based licenses since the software license term and the maintenance term are co-terminus.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We routinely assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets.\nIn determining the realizability of the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets, we consider numerous factors including historical profitability, estimated future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the industry in which we operate. Our management reassesses the realization of the deferred tax assets each reporting period, which has resulted in a full valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. To the extent that the financial results of our United States operations improve in the future and the deferred tax assets become realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowance through earnings.\nWe follow ASC 740-10-25 with regards to accounting for uncertain tax positions, which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken within an income tax return. For each tax position, the enterprise must determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize within the financial statements. No benefits may be recognized for tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold.\nOur intention is to reinvest the total amount of our unremitted foreign earnings in the local international jurisdictions, except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. As a result, we do not provide for United States taxes on the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service / vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price volatility.\nWe estimate the grant date fair value of stock options and the related compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions including: (1) expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the options granted, (2) volatility, (3) risk-free rate and (4) dividends. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates. We have estimated\nexpected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical turnover rate and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate. If our actual forfeiture rate varies from our estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. In general, the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nSince adopting ASC 718, we have been unable to use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. As such, we have utilized the simplified\u201d method, as prescribed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to estimate on a formula basis the expected term of its stock options considered to have plain vanilla\u201d characteristics.\nWe utilize the Federal Reserve Board's published Treasury Constant Maturity rate which most closely matches the option term. As an example, for a 6.25 year term, we would use the 7-year rate coinciding with the option issuance date.\nWe have never paid dividends and do not currently intend to pay dividends.\nAs we do not have a trading history for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in July 2012 or a significant trading range for our common stock trading since our initial public offering, we estimate the expected price volatility for our common stock by taking the average historic price volatility for selected industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock options granted. Our industry peers consist of several public companies similar to us in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to consistently apply this process using the same public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our common stock becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the currently utilized companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, we will identify and utilize more suitable companies with publicly available share prices in the calculation.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual property. The costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized. We have determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of software is completed. Because we believe that under our current process for developing software completion of the software occurs essentially concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have been capitalized to date.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used to develop internal systems, are capitalized. Capitalized costs include external consulting fees and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees in our development and information technology groups who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, our internal-use software projects during the application development stage. Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete and we commit resources to the software project. Amortization of the asset commences when the software is complete and placed in service. We amortize completed internal-use software over its estimated useful life. Costs incurred during the planning, training and post-implementation stages of the software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred. Costs related to upgrades and enhancements of existing internal-use software that increase the functionality of the software are also capitalized.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe have foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and China. Foreign subsidiary records are maintained in the local currency. Foreign currency effects are accounted for in accordance with ASC 830 - Foreign Currency Matters. Other than for our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, the functional currency for all subsidiaries is the respective local currency. The resulting gains and losses from translation are included as a component of other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses and re-measurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are included in other income (expense), net. For our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, which is unable to generate sufficient cash flows in its local currency to sustain operational viability, all assets and liabilities are re-measured into United States dollars, with any resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\nWe review the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a quarterly basis in accordance with the Foreign/Parent Currency\u201d indicators outlined in Appendix A to ASC 830 to determine if any changes should be made.\nValuation of Acquired Intangible Assets\nOur intangible assets, which were acquired as part of a business combination, are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate intangible assets when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of impairment. Should the fair value of our finite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle, as a result of which more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).\nThough we continue to evaluate the impact of our pending adoption of this standard, we plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting recognized at the date of adoption. The standard is expected to have a significant impact on the way we account and contract for our on-premise software license contracts. Accounting for revenue related to services and ExaCLOUD offerings is expected to remain substantially unchanged due to the over-time nature of such performance obligations. Due to the complexity of certain of our license contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard may be dependent on contract-specific terms at the time of sale and adoption of the new standard. We are also assessing the impact of capitalizing costs associated with ongoing customer contracts, specifically commission payments.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this ASU and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial results.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods therein. We have evaluated this standard and believe that when we adopt it in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. As part of the adoption, we expect to cease applying a forfeiture rate estimate when calculating share-based compensation expense, which is not expected to result in a material adjustment to retained earnings in fiscal year 2018. Additionally, while we have $1,199 of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits attributable to stock option exercises, the adoption is not expected to result in any adjustment to retained earnings because of our full valuation allowance in the United States. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments will now be included in net operating cash rather than in net financing cash. These changes related to excess tax benefits will be applied prospectively in accordance with this standard, and prior periods will not be adjusted.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)-Restricted Cash. This standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Early adoption is permitted. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this ASU, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a company that develops, sells, and supports simulation software and services primarily used by vehicle manufacturers.

statements and notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, including but not limited to those set forth in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe develop, sell and support simulation software and services used primarily by vehicle manufacturers to enhance the performance of their products, reduce product development costs and improve the efficiency of their design and engineering processes. Our solutions enable our customers to augment or replace inefficient and expensive methods of evaluating alternative designs, such as wind tunnel testing using physical prototypes, with accurate digital simulations that are more useful and timely. We believe, based on feedback from our customers and data published by them, that use of our software solutions enables significant cost savings and fundamental improvements in their vehicle development process by allowing their engineers and designers to gain crucial insights about design performance early in the design cycle.\nOur core product, PowerFLOW\u00ae, is an innovative software solution for simulating complex fluid flow problems, including aerodynamics, thermal management, and aeroacoustics, or wind noise. PowerFLOW relies upon our proprietary technology that we refer to as Digital Physics\u00ae, which is based on algorithms known as the lattice Boltzmann method. Our proprietary technology enables PowerFLOW to predict complex fluid flows with a level of reliability comparable to or better than physical testing, with results that are more accurate and useful than those of alternative computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, methods.\nWe currently focus primarily on the ground transportation market, including manufacturers in the passenger vehicle, highway truck, off-highway vehicle and train markets, as well as their suppliers. Over 150 manufacturers currently utilize our products and services, including the top 15 global passenger vehicle manufacturers. This data is based on motor vehicle production volume for 2015, as reported by the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles, or the International Organization of Vehicle Manufacturers. Global vehicle manufacturers face increasing pressure, from government mandates as well as from consumers, to improve the efficiency of their products. This requires different powertrain choices, changes in the shape of the vehicle, and reductions in vehicle weight, all of which we believe favor the adoption of simulation-driven design.\nWe continue to expand our offerings in the aerospace and oil and gas production markets and explore other markets in which we believe the capabilities of PowerFLOW have broad application, such as the chemical processing, architecture engineering and construction, power generation, biomedical and electronics industries. The investment in our aerospace vertical business has increased our domain and portfolio of new applications. We have built a customer base of airframe, jet engine and supply manufacturers. We also recently announced the commercial launch and license of our product for use in the oil and gas production market.\nWe offer our solutions through annual capacity-based licenses, either as software-only, to be run on the customer's own computer hardware, or in the form of software-as-a-service, via our hosted ExaCLOUD offerings. We sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force, including sales executives and applications engineering teams deployed near our customers in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea and China, through a distributor in India and through a sales agent in Brazil.\nWe have a predictable business model based on recurring revenue from a growing customer base. For fiscal year 2017, we recorded total revenues, net loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $72.6 million, $(1.1) million and $6.5 million, respectively, as compared to $65.4 million, $4.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal year 2016. Since generating our first commercial revenue in 1994, our annual revenue has increased for 22 consecutive years.\nDuring the twelve months ended January 31, 2017, revenue growth was driven by continued deployment of our simulation solutions with our existing customer base as well as by the addition of new customers. We believe that our continued investments in field resources yield growth in both project and license revenue over time. While our geographic mix of revenue outside of the Americas during fiscal year 2017 was consistent with historical trends, the weakening U.S. dollar, particularly against the yen, had a material positive impact on revenue performance for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, 74% of our revenue came from outside of the Americas as compared to 71% for fiscal year 2016. Revenue growth for fiscal year 2017 was 10.9% over the same period a year ago and 9.0% when measured on a constant currency basis.\nIn the last two months of fiscal year 2017, we experienced increased caution regarding growth and deployment initiatives from our ground transportation customers, which impacted our incremental growth on some renewal orders. We attributed this to our\ncustomers anticipating the impact of changes in the tax, trade and regulatory frameworks within which they operate. Based on renewal activity during this period, we expect that this will have an impact on revenue over the next fiscal year. In addition, as we have experienced on a limited basis in the past, we had a significantly reduced renewal commitment that will impact revenue and growth in the next fiscal year.\nThroughout the last decade the market has increasingly recognized the benefits of the lattice Boltzmann-based CFD method to extend digital simulation possibilities. We have observed increased customer interest in not only Exa's proprietary lattice Boltzmann technology, but also in alternative commercial, open source and in-house codes. We believe that the increased market awareness of the lattice Boltzmann method is a positive trend for our product offering in the long run due to our technical leadership, intellectual property and experience with this technology.\nAdjusted EBITDA and revenue on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue on a constant currency basis, and explanation of our management's use of these measures and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, please see - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\nAs a percent of revenue, our total operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased approximately 4.7% when compared to the same period last year. This decrease is a result of our prior investments in resources to drive top line growth, including sales, marketing and research and development. While the majority of our expense base is in the United States, we have field resources based in our international offices which provide some natural foreign exchange hedge. As a result, the weakening dollar had a negative impact on total operating expenses when compared to the same period last year. For fiscal year 2017, total operating expenses were $72.2 million, with growth of 5.9% over the prior year and 5.7% when measured on a constant currency basis. See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for information about how we calculate and use operating expenses on a constant currency basis.\nAs a percent of revenue, our income from operations for fiscal year 2017 was 0.5% compared with our loss from operations of 4.2% for fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of cost-saving initiatives during fiscal year 2017 and the foreign currency impacts described above.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million compared to $27.6 million as of January 31, 2016. The strong cash balance reflects strong accounts receivable collections activity and normal seasonal cash flows. Capital expenditures increased by $1.8 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to a $3.7 million investment in server equipment for our new high performance computing data center located in Virginia.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers' purchases of our software products. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their budget cycles, which typically coincide with the calendar year, except in Japan, where our customers' budget cycle typically begins on April 1. Because our software products are sold pursuant to annual subscription agreements and we recognize revenue from these subscriptions over the term of the agreement, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. However, these seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as we generally receive the annual license fee at the time the license term commences, or shortly thereafter. As a result, our cash flows from operations are typically highest in the first quarter of each fiscal year.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods presented, data from our consolidated statements of operation, as well as that data as a percentage of revenues. The information contained in these tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n (1) Amounts include stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\n (2) Includes amortization expense related to intangible assets as follows: \n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, data from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues:\n\nDue to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of line items in the table above.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nLicense revenue increased 13.7% from $53.5 million in fiscal year 2016 to $60.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The $7.3 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of new license customers throughout the year. Deployment continues to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets. Project revenue decreased by $0.2 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, which reflects our slowed investment in project capacity in fiscal year 2017, and we anticipate continued fluctuations in project revenue growth into fiscal year 2018. However, our project delivery capability continues to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth. Both license and project revenue, particularly new customer opportunities, are leveraging the capabilities of our ExaCLOUD platform. Virtually all of our projects are now being delivered using ExaCLOUD exposing our customers to its capabilities. ExaCLOUD continues to play an increasingly important role in our new customer acquisition go-to-market model.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the Japanese yen, positively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2017 by $1.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2016. On a constant currency basis, our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 increased 9.0%, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nCost of revenues\n\nCost of revenues for fiscal year 2017 was $19.4 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3.4%, compared with $20.1 million during fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 26.8% for fiscal year 2017 from 30.7% for fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decrease in cost of revenues was driven by decreased personnel-related costs of approximately $1.3 million associated with a change in headcount mix and lower stock-based compensations, along with a $0.2 million decrease in hosting fees driven by savings from an amended hosting agreement at our high performance computing data center in New Jersey. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty costs and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation expense related to investments made to increase computing capacity.\nSales and marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 36.5% compared with $10.2 million for fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased to 19.1% for fiscal year 2017 from 15.5% for fiscal year 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to a $3.5 million increase in payroll and employee-related costs driven by a change in headcount mix, increased travel expenses, and increased commission expense related to the increased volume and timing of customer orders. The balance of the $0.2 million year-over-year change was driven primarily by increased recruiting fees and expenses for general marketing initiatives.\nResearch and development\n\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $24.3 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.7%, compared with $24.1 million for fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expense decreased to 33.5% for fiscal year 2017 from 36.9% for fiscal year 2016. The period-over-period increase in expense is attributable to a $0.3 million increase in professional service fees due to increased legal fees associated with the hiring of foreign employees and other software consulting fees; a net increase of $0.2 million in payroll and other employee-related costs driven by an increase in headcount and merit increases and partially offset by lower bonus and commission expense, lower travel expenses and lower stock-based compensation expense; and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation expense due to investments made to increase computing capacity. These increases were partially offset by decreases in network and facility expenses as a result of a $0.4 million decrease in hosting fees driven by savings from an amended hosting agreement at our high performance computing data center in New Jersey.\nGeneral and administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $14.6 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 5.9%, compared with $13.8 million for fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 20.1% for fiscal year 2017 from 21.0% for fiscal year 2016. The period-over-period increase in expense was primarily driven by a $0.4 million increase in pre-launch hosting costs associated with the commencement of a new agreement at our new high performance computer data center in Virginia. The balance of the increase is primarily attributable to a net increase of $0.4 million in payroll-related costs driven by an increase in headcount and merit increases and partially offset by lower bonus expense.\nTotal other income (expense), net\n\nTotal other income (expense), net for the year ended January 31, 2017 was $0.1 million compared to total other income (expense), net of $(0.5) million for the year ended January 31, 2016. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses offset by interest expense associate with our capital lease obligations. The period-over-period change in total other income (expense), net is primarily attributable to foreign exchange fluctuations in the Euro and Japanese yen.\nProvision for income taxes\n\nThe income tax provision increased from $1.5 million in fiscal year 2016 to $1.6 million in fiscal year 2017. The provision for both periods primarily consists of the tax effects of foreign operating results with foreign withholding taxes.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we determined that the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets were no longer more-likely-than-not realizable. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax provision of $14.4 million to establish a full valuation allowance on the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets. In determining the realizability of these assets, we considered numerous factors including historical profitability, estimated future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the industry in which we operate. Through the three months ended April 30, 2015, our results reflected a three-year cumulative loss position in the United States; prior thereto, our historical results reflected a three-year cumulative profit. Reflecting management's plans to continue investing in the business for future growth, we continued in a three-year cumulative loss position through the remainder of fiscal year 2015 and 2016. This historical loss position at April 30, 2015 and projected cumulative loss position resulted in significant negative evidence which caused management to modify its assessment of our deferred tax assets, concluding that it no longer was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized and thus, a valuation allowance was necessary against the full amount of our United States net deferred tax assets. Most of our revenues are generated from ground transportation customers outside the United States but a significantly disproportionate amount of our operating expenses, including investments in future products, are incurred in the United States, causing the results of operations in the United States to reflect losses during this period of investment.\nOur management reassesses the realization of the deferred tax assets each reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of our United States operations improve in the future and the deferred tax assets become realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowance through earnings.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset our United States federal taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a three-year period. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, management determined that we had experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382. This ownership change resulted in annual limitations to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit was approximately $14.0 million for fiscal year 2015, $16.8 million for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2019, $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020 and $6.4 million for each fiscal year thereafter. The ownership change also resulted in the loss of our ability to utilize essentially all state net operating loss carryforwards, credits and other state attributes, which resulted in a write-off of $0.8 million of state deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2015.\nWe do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly within the next twelve months. We and one or more of our subsidiaries file United States federal income tax returns and tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, local or foreign examinations for years prior to January 31, 2012. However, carryforward attributes that were generated prior to January 31, 2013 may still be adjusted upon examination by state or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nLicense revenue increased 7.6% from $49.7 million in fiscal year 2015 to $53.5 million in fiscal year 2016. The $3.8 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of 17 new license customers. Deployment continued to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets and in our North America passenger automotive customer base. Project revenue increased $0.3 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to expanded sales and greater activity with existing customers. We anticipated less project revenue growth in fiscal year 2016 as our investment in project capacity has slowed. But our project delivery capability continued to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the weakness of the Euro and the Japanese yen, negatively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2016 by $5.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2015. On a constant currency basis, our total revenues in fiscal year 2016 increased 15.0%, compared with fiscal year 2015.\nCost of revenues\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7:\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For fiscal year 2017, we recorded total revenues, net loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $72.6 million, $(1.1) million and $6.5 million, respectively, as compared to $65.4 million, $4.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal year 2016.

For the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue on a constant currency basis, and explanation of our management's use of these measures and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, please see - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\nAs a percent of revenue, our total operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased approximately 4.7% when compared to the same period last year. This decrease is a result of our prior investments in resources to drive top line growth, including sales, marketing and research and development. While the majority of our expense base is in the United States, we have field resources based in our international offices which provide some natural foreign exchange hedge.

See - Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for information about how we calculate and use operating expenses on a constant currency basis.\nAs a percent of revenue, our income from operations for fiscal year 2017 was 0.5% compared with our loss from operations of 4.2% for fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of cost-saving initiatives during fiscal year 2017 and the foreign currency impacts described above.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million compared to $27.6 million as of January 31, 2016. The strong cash balance reflects strong accounts receivable collections activity and normal seasonal cash flows. Capital expenditures increased by $1.8 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to a $3.7 million investment in server equipment for our new high performance computing data center located in Virginia.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers' purchases of our software products. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their budget cycles, which typically coincide with the calendar year, except in Japan, where our customers' budget cycle typically begins on April 1. Because our software products are sold pursuant to annual subscription agreements and we recognize revenue from these subscriptions over the term of the agreement, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. However, these seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as we generally receive the annual license fee at the time the license term commences, or shortly thereafter. As a result, our cash flows from operations are typically highest in the first quarter of each fiscal year.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods presented, data from our consolidated statements of operation, as well as that data as a percentage of revenues. The information contained in these tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 119:

to $60.8 million in fiscal year 2017. The $7.3 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of new license customers throughout the year. Deployment continues to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets. Project revenue decreased by $0.2 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, which reflects our slowed investment in project capacity in fiscal year 2017, and we anticipate continued fluctuations in project revenue growth into fiscal year 2018. However, our project delivery capability continues to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth. Both license and project revenue, particularly new customer opportunities, are leveraging the capabilities of our ExaCLOUD platform. Virtually all of our projects are now being delivered using ExaCLOUD exposing our customers to its capabilities. ExaCLOUD continues to play an increasingly important role in our new customer acquisition go-to-market model.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the Japanese yen, positively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2017 by $1.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2016. On a constant currency basis, our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 increased 9.0%, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nCost of revenues\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (690\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenues for fiscal year 2017 was $19.4 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3.4%, compared with $20.1 million during fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 26.8% for fiscal year 2017 from 30.7% for fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decrease in cost of revenues was driven by decreased personnel-related costs of approximately $1.3 million associated with a change in headcount mix and lower stock-based compensations, along with a $0.2 million decrease in hosting fees driven by savings from an amended hosting agreement at our high performance computing data center in New Jersey. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in royalty costs and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation expense related to investments made to increase computing capacity.\nSales and marketing\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $13.9 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 36.5% compared with $10.2 million for fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased to 19.1% for fiscal year 2017 from 15.5% for fiscal year 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to a $3.5 million increase in payroll and employee-related costs driven by a change in headcount mix, increased travel expenses, and increased commission expense related to the increased volume and timing of customer orders. The balance of the $0.2 million year-over-year change was driven primarily by increased recruiting fees and expenses for general marketing initiatives.\nResearch and development\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $24.3 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.7%, compared with $24.1 million for fiscal year 2016. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expense decreased to 33.5% for fiscal year 2017 from 36.9% for fiscal year 2016. The period-over-period increase in expense is attributable to a $0.3 million increase in professional service fees due to increased legal fees associated with the hiring of foreign employees and other software consulting fees; a net increase of $0.2 million in payroll and other employee-related costs driven by an increase in headcount and merit increases and partially offset by lower bonus and commission expense, lower travel expenses and lower stock-based compensation expense; and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation expense due to investments made to increase computing capacity.

The period-over-period change in total other income (expense), net is primarily attributable to foreign exchange fluctuations in the Euro and Japanese yen.\nProvision for income taxes\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe income tax provision increased from $1.5 million in fiscal year 2016 to $1.6 million in fiscal year 2017. The provision for both periods primarily consists of the tax effects of foreign operating results with foreign withholding taxes.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we determined that the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets were no longer more-likely-than-not realizable. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax provision of $14.4 million to establish a full valuation allowance on the net United States federal and state deferred tax assets. In determining the realizability of these assets, we considered numerous factors including historical profitability, estimated future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the industry in which we operate. Through the three months ended April 30, 2015, our results reflected a three-year cumulative loss position in the United States; prior thereto, our historical results reflected a three-year cumulative profit. Reflecting management's plans to continue investing in the business for future growth, we continued in a three-year cumulative loss position through the remainder of fiscal year 2015 and 2016. This historical loss position at April 30, 2015 and projected cumulative loss position resulted in significant negative evidence which caused management to modify its assessment of our deferred tax assets, concluding that it no longer was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized and thus, a valuation allowance was necessary against the full amount of our United States net deferred tax assets. Most of our revenues are generated from ground transportation customers outside the United States but a significantly disproportionate amount of our operating expenses, including investments in future products, are incurred in the United States, causing the results of operations in the United States to reflect losses during this period of investment.\nOur management reassesses the realization of the deferred tax assets each reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of our United States operations improve in the future and the deferred tax assets become realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowance through earnings.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset our United States federal taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a three-year period. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, management determined that we had experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382. This ownership change resulted in annual limitations to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit was approximately $14.0 million for fiscal year 2015, $16.8 million for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2019, $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020 and $6.4 million for each fiscal year thereafter. The ownership change also resulted in the loss of our ability to utilize essentially all state net operating loss carryforwards, credits and other state attributes, which resulted in a write-off of $0.8 million of state deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2015.\nWe do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly within the next twelve months. We and one or more of our subsidiaries file United States federal income tax returns and tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, local or foreign examinations for years prior to January 31, 2012. However, carryforward attributes that were generated prior to January 31, 2013 may still be adjusted upon examination by state or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Project revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenue increased 7.6% from $49.7 million in fiscal year 2015 to $53.5 million in fiscal year 2016. The $3.8 million increase was driven almost entirely by increased consumption of simulation capacity by existing customers and the addition of 17 new license customers. Deployment continued to expand in our core customer base across our portfolio of applications. We experienced particularly strong demand in our Asian markets and in our North America passenger automotive customer base. Project revenue increased $0.3 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to expanded sales and greater activity with existing customers. We anticipated less project revenue growth in fiscal year 2016 as our investment in project capacity has slowed. But our project delivery capability continued to recycle into new opportunities to drive license growth.\nForeign exchange fluctuations, particularly the weakness of the Euro and the Japanese yen, negatively impacted total revenue in fiscal year 2016 by $5.2 million as compared to fiscal year 2015. On a constant currency basis, our total revenues in fiscal year 2016 increased 15.0%, compared with fiscal year 2015.\nCost of revenues\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
