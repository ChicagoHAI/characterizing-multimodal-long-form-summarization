Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with Item 6 Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs, which are designed to treat disease by restoring the function of a dysbiotic microbiome. Our lead product candidate, SER-109, is designed to prevent further recurrences of Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, infection, or CDI, a debilitating infection of the colon, by treating the dysbiosis of the colonic microbiome and, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, could be a first-in-field oral microbiome drug. Using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are developing additional product candidates to treat diseases where the microbiome is implicated, including SER-262, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent an initial recurrence of primary CDI, SER-287 to treat inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, SER-301, a synthetic IBD candidate, and SER-155, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or allo-HSCT, due to infections and graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD. We are also using our microbiome therapeutics platform to conduct research on metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease; rare liver disorders such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); and immuno-oncology treatments.\nSince our inception in October 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing SER-109, SER-287 and SER-262, researching our pre-clinical candidates SER-155 and SER-301, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 8.5 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $139.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on June 26, 2015, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 22.9 million shares of our common stock. The shares issued upon closing of the IPO included 1.1 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. All of our product candidates other than SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 are still in pre-clinical or research development. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $174.2 million.\nOn July 29, 2016, we announced the interim 8-week results from our SER-109 Phase 2 clinical study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI. In that study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8 week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statically significant. SER-109 was generally safe and well-tolerated in our Phase 1b/2 clinical study and in the Phase 2 clinical study. The most common adverse events for SER-109 and placebo, respectively, were diarrhea (25% vs. 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs. 14%), flatulence (12% vs. 3%), and nausea (10% vs. 10%). No drug-related serious adverse events were observed.\nIn order to understand the difference in outcome between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and chemistry, manufacturing and control data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods, that may have differed between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We have now identified specific factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the trial. The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo. Diagnosis of C. difficile infection for both study entry and for endpoint analysis will be confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. Patients in the SER-109 arm will receive a total SER-109 dose, administered over three days, approximately 10-fold higher than the dose used in the prior Phase 2 study. The new study will evaluate patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint will compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and CMC parameters.\nWe initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of SER-287 in December 2015 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017. We initiated a Phase 1b clinical study of SER-262 in July 2016 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017.\nOur expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we:\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the clinical development of SER-109, our lead product candidate; based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the clinical development of SER-262 to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the clinical development of SER-287 for the treatment of UC;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct research and continue pre-clinical development of additional Ecobiotic\u00ae microbiome therapeutics, including SER-155 to improve clinical outcomes following allo-HSCT due to infections and GvHD and SER-301, our synthetic IBD product candidate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities, including potentially planning and building a small-scale commercial manufacturing facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain and augment our intellectual property portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary intellectual property;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> begin to build the infrastructure necessary to support potential commercialization of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nIn January 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Nestec Ltd., or NHS, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn's disease. The License Agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory, and is expected to provide substantial financial support for our ongoing research and development. We have retained full commercial rights to our entire portfolio of product candidates with respect to the United States and Canada, where we plan to build our own commercial organization.\nUnder the License Agreement, we granted to NHS an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, in the Licensed Territory, certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or, collectively, the NHS Collaboration Products. We also granted to NHS a non-exclusive license to export, develop and make NHS Collaboration Products in the licensed fields worldwide solely for commercialization in the licensed fields and in the Licensed Territory.\nIn exchange for the license, NHS made an upfront cash payment of $120 million to us in February 2016. NHS has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. Additionally, NHS has agreed to pay us up to $660 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $1.125 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of NHS Collaboration Products. We received a $10.0 million milestone payments in 2016 associated with the planned initiation of a Phase 1b study for SER-262 in CDI. The full potential value of the up-front payment and milestone payments payable by NHS is over $1.9 billion, assuming all products receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. NHS is also obligated to pay some of the costs related to our clinical trials. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues from collaborations have been derived from the License Agreement.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, pre-clinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture drug products for use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. All costs associated with the License Agreement are recorded in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOur primary focus of research and development since inception has been on our microbiome therapeutics platform and the subsequent development of SER-109, SER-262, SER-287, SER-301 and SER-155. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants and CROs in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee-related costs and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and, as such, are classified as costs of our microbiome therapeutics platform research, along with external costs directly related to our microbiome therapeutics platform.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred on our platform and by product development program.\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Microbiome therapeutics platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of SER-287 and SER-262, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-301, and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future if we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also may incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of amortization of purchased premiums and discounts associated with our investments. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest expense consisted of interest at the stated rate on borrowings under our loan and security agreement, amortization of deferred financing costs and interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount associated with (1) the fair value of preferred stock warrant we issued in connection with the loan and security agreement and (2) a final payment due at maturity. There was no such interest expense recorded for these items in 2016 as we held no preferred stock warrants or debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevaluation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nRevaluation of preferred stock warrant liability consists of the net gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. In connection with the loan and security agreement, we issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, which we believe is a financial instrument that may have required a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified this warrant as a liability that we re-measured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ on June 26, 2015, the preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase common stock. We performed the final mark to market adjustment on the preferred stock warrant using the fair value of the underlying common shares of $18.00 per share on June 26, 2015 and recorded the change in fair value in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The preferred stock warrant liability was then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it became a warrant to purchase common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2010, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively, both of which begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $13.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2031 and 2028, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits include an orphan drug credit carryforward of $8.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCollaboration revenue\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we identify the deliverables included in the arrangement and determine: (1) whether the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a standalone basis and represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting; and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner, the retention of any key rights by us, and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s) and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nIn situations where we have identified multiple units of accounting, the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over the estimated performance period as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting.\nIf there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement for the single unit of accounting on a time-based proportional performance method over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Alternatively, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the time-based proportional performance method or effort-based proportional performance method, as applicable.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (iii) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. We recognize revenue associated with substantive milestones in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method upon successful accomplishment of each milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nApplication of the above guidance requires significant judgment and requires the Company to make determinations based on the facts and circumstances under each arrangement.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs in connection with performing research services on our behalf and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendors in connection with pre-clinical and clinical development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of pre-clinical and clinical supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to pre-clinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight- line method. The Company recognizes adjustments to stock compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non- employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because we lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and non-employees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We adjust stock-based compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations:\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of stock options\nPrior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined contemporaneously by our board of directors based on valuation estimates provided by management and prepared in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or AICPA Practice Aid, as well as independent third-party valuations. Our contemporaneous valuations of our common stock were based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time of each grant and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO. Consequently, after the IPO the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options is the closing price on the option grant date.\nValuation of Warrant to Purchase Convertible Preferred Stock\nWe classified a warrant to purchase shares of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock as a liability on our balance sheets as this warrant is a free-standing financial instrument that may require us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant was initially recorded at fair value on date of grant, and it was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of this warrant were recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to value the preferred stock warrant. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value per share of the underlying Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrant, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the price of the underlying preferred stock. We determine the fair value per share of the underlying preferred stock by taking into consideration our most recent sales of our convertible preferred stock, results obtained from third-party valuations and additional factors that we deemed relevant. We have historically been a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrant. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrant. We estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends.\nUpon the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ on June 26, 2015, the preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase common stock. We performed the final mark to market adjustment on the preferred stock warrant using the fair value of the underlying common shares of $18.00 per share on June 26, 2015 and recorded the change in fair value in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The preferred stock warrant liability was then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it became a warrant to purchase common stock.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company'' such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to \u2018\u2018opt out'' of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Of this $21.8 million, $10.0 million was received from NHS associated with the initiation of the Phase 1b study for SER-262 in CDI which is a substantive development milestone under the License Agreement. We recognized revenue associated with substantive milestones in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method. The $10.0 million was recognized in full as related party collaboration revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining $11.8 million relates to the recognition of the $120.0 million upfront payment from NHS over the estimated performance period of 10 years. We had no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92,839\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,856\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,983\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (969\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (555\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (414\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revaluation of preferred stock warrant liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (91,579\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,780\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,799\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Microbiome therapeutics platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $82.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The $1.7 million increase in other income, net was primarily due to gains recorded to adjust the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability due to a decrease in the fair value of the underlying Series A-2 convertible preferred stock over that period.\nIn connection with the extinguishment of the loan and security agreement, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $0.1 million, which has been recorded as interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have generated revenue only from collaborations and have incurred recurring net losses. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses may continue to increase and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional financings, public offerings, research funding, additional collaborations, contract and grant revenue or other sources.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO, and issued and sold 8.5 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $139.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The shares issued upon closing of the IPO included 1.1 million shares of our common stock, which were sold pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. Upon the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ on June 26, 2015, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 22.9 million shares of our common stock.\nIn January 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with NHS, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn's disease. In exchange for the license, NHS agreed to pay us an upfront cash payment of $120 million, which we received in February 2016. NHS has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. We are eligible to receive up to $285.0 million in development milestone payments, $375.0 million in regulatory payments and up to an aggregate of $1.1 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of NHS Collaboration Products. The full potential value of the up-front payment and milestone payments payable by NHS is over $1.9 billion, assuming all products receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. In September 2016, we received a $10 million milestone payment associated with the initiation of the Phase 1b clinical study for SER-262 in CDI.\nFor the development of NHS Collaboration Products for IBD under a global development plan, we agreed to pay the costs of clinical trials of such products up to and including Phase 2 clinical trials, and 67% of the costs for Phase 3 and other clinical trials of such products, with NHS bearing the remaining 33% of such costs. For other clinical development of NHS Collaboration Products for IBD, we agreed to pay the costs of such activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and NHS agreed to bear the cost of such activities to support approval of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory.\nWith respect to development of NHS Collaboration Products for CDI under a global development plan, we agreed to pay all costs of Phase 2 clinical trials for SER-109 and for Phase 3 clinical trials for SER-109. We agreed to bear all costs of conducting any Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials under a global development plan for NHS Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI. We agreed to pay 67% and NHS agreed to pay 33% of other costs of Phase 3 clinical trials conducted for NHS Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI under a global development plan. For other clinical development of NHS Collaboration Products for CDI, we agreed to pay costs of such development activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and NHS agreed to bear the cost of such activities to support approval of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $230.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $174.2 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,844\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (65,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (137,133\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 137,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,394\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,252\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities provided $43.9 million of cash, primarily due to upfront cash of $120.0 million and a milestone payment of $10.0 million received in connection with the License Agreement, and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $6.0 million. This increase was partially offset by a net loss of $91.6 million, less non-cash charges of $20.7 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of a $3.6 million increase in accounts payable and a $5.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset in part by $2.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increases in our accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to the timing of payments, an increase in payroll related costs, and an increase in amounts accrued for clinical trial and contracted manufacturing expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due primarily to prepayments made for clinical trial activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, operating activities used $40.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $54.8 million and cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $3.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $10.8 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of a $2.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $2.9 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increases in our accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to the timing of payments, an increase in payroll related costs, and an increase in amounts accrued for clinical trial and contracted manufacturing expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due primarily to prepayments made for clinical trial activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, operating activities used $10.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $16.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.1 million and by cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.3 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in accounts payable was due to an overall increase in our development activities, primarily driven by expenditures in connection with advancing the development of SER-109. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was due to an increase in accruals for development and manufacturing costs related to SER-109; payroll and payroll-related costs due primarily to bonuses; legal and audit-related professional fees; and facility- related costs.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $65.5 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of investments of $290.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of $21.5 million; these increases were offset by maturities of investments of $246.5 million and a decrease in our restricted cash balance of $0.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $137.1 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of investments of $267.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $4.4 million, and an increase in our restricted cash balance of $1.4 million; these increases were offset by maturities of investments of $136.4 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we used $1.1 million of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.1 million in connection with the exercise of options to purchase our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $137.7 million as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our IPO of $143.0 million and proceeds of $0.3 million in connection with the exercise of options and warrants to purchase our common stock. These increases were partially offset by principal repayments of $2.6 million of borrowings under our loan and security agreement and payments of costs in connection with the IPO of $2.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $124.0 million as a result of net proceeds of $123.2 million received from our sale of Series B, Series C, Series D and Series D-1 convertible preferred stock and $2.0 million from borrowings under our loan and security agreement. These amounts were partially offset by principal repayments of $0.4 million of borrowings under our loan and security agreement and payments of IPO costs of $0.8 million.\nFunding Requirements\nOur expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities related to SER-109, which is still in clinical development, and our follow-on therapeutics and other programs. In addition we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the clinical development of SER-109, our lead product candidate; based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct our Phase 1b clinical studies of SER-287 and SER-262;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek to enhance our microbiome therapeutics platform and discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-301;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potentially establish a sales and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts and to support operations as a public company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> perform our obligations under the collaboration agreement with NHS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2018. This estimate excludes net cash flows from future business development activities. The specifics of future SER-109 related activities could impact capital requirements, and cash projections. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 or our follow-on programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements for SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 or our other programs will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the clinical development of SER-109, our lead product candidate; based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress and results of our Phase 1b clinical study of SER-287;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress and results of our Phase 1b clinical study of SER-262;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-301;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates and research activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting pre-clinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives.\nAdequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, in addition to the License Agreement, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Amounts in the table reflect payments due for (i) our laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under an operating lease agreement that expires in November 2023 and (ii) our lease for office and laboratory space in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a term expiring April 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, pre-clinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with Item 6 Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs, which are designed to treat disease by restoring the function of a dysbiotic microbiome. Our lead product candidate, SER-109, is designed to prevent further recurrences of Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, infection, or CDI, a debilitating infection of the colon, by treating the dysbiosis of the colonic microbiome and, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, could be a first-in-field oral microbiome drug. Using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are developing additional product candidates to treat diseases where the microbiome is implicated, including SER-262, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent an initial recurrence of primary CDI, SER-287 to treat inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, SER-301, a synthetic IBD candidate, and SER-155, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or allo-HSCT, due to infections and graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD. We are also using our microbiome therapeutics platform to conduct research on metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease; rare liver disorders such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); and immuno-oncology treatments.\nSince our inception in October 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing SER-109, SER-287 and SER-262, researching our pre-clinical candidates SER-155 and SER-301, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 8.5 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $139.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on June 26, 2015, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 22.9 million shares of our common stock. The shares issued upon closing of the IPO included 1.1 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. All of our product candidates other than SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 are still in pre-clinical or research development. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $174.2 million.\nOn July 29, 2016, we announced the interim 8-week results from our SER-109 Phase 2 clinical study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI. In that study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8 week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statically significant. SER-109 was generally safe and well-tolerated in our Phase 1b/2 clinical study and in the Phase 2 clinical study. The most common adverse events for SER-109 and placebo, respectively, were diarrhea (25% vs. 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs. 14%), flatulence (12% vs. 3%), and nausea (10% vs. 10%). No drug-related serious adverse events were observed.\nIn order to understand the difference in outcome between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and chemistry, manufacturing and control data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods, that may have differed between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We have now identified specific factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the trial. The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo. Diagnosis of C. difficile infection for both study entry and for endpoint analysis will be confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. Patients in the SER-109 arm will receive a total SER-109 dose, administered over three days, approximately 10-fold higher than the dose used in the prior Phase 2 study. The new study will evaluate patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint will compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and CMC parameters.\nWe initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of SER-287 in December 2015 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017. We initiated a Phase 1b clinical study of SER-262 in July 2016 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017.\nOur expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we:\n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-109, our lead product candidate; based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-262 to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-287 for the treatment of UC; \n \u2022 conduct research and continue pre-clinical development of additional Ecobiotic\u00ae microbiome therapeutics, including SER-155 to improve clinical outcomes following allo-HSCT due to infections and GvHD and SER-301, our synthetic IBD product candidate; \n \u2022 make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities, including potentially planning and building a small-scale commercial manufacturing facility; \n \u2022 maintain and augment our intellectual property portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary intellectual property; \n \u2022 begin to build the infrastructure necessary to support potential commercialization of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates. \nIn addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nIn January 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Nestec Ltd., or NHS, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn's disease. The License Agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory, and is expected to provide substantial financial support for our ongoing research and development. We have retained full commercial rights to our entire portfolio of product candidates with respect to the United States and Canada, where we plan to build our own commercial organization.\nUnder the License Agreement, we granted to NHS an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, in the Licensed Territory, certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or, collectively, the NHS Collaboration Products. We also granted to NHS a non-exclusive license to export, develop and make NHS Collaboration Products in the licensed fields worldwide solely for commercialization in the licensed fields and in the Licensed Territory.\nIn exchange for the license, NHS made an upfront cash payment of $120 million to us in February 2016. NHS has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. Additionally, NHS has agreed to pay us up to $660 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $1.125 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of NHS Collaboration Products. We received a $10.0 million milestone payments in 2016 associated with the planned initiation of a Phase 1b study for SER-262 in CDI. The full potential value of the up-front payment and milestone payments payable by NHS is over $1.9 billion, assuming all products receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. NHS is also obligated to pay some of the costs related to our clinical trials. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues from collaborations have been derived from the License Agreement.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, pre-clinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture drug products for use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials; \n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions; \n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses; \n \u2022 the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. All costs associated with the License Agreement are recorded in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOur primary focus of research and development since inception has been on our microbiome therapeutics platform and the subsequent development of SER-109, SER-262, SER-287, SER-301 and SER-155. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants and CROs in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee-related costs and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and, as such, are classified as costs of our microbiome therapeutics platform research, along with external costs directly related to our microbiome therapeutics platform.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred on our platform and by product development program.\n\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of SER-287 and SER-262, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-301, and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future if we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also may incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of amortization of purchased premiums and discounts associated with our investments. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest expense consisted of interest at the stated rate on borrowings under our loan and security agreement, amortization of deferred financing costs and interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount associated with (1) the fair value of preferred stock warrant we issued in connection with the loan and security agreement and (2) a final payment due at maturity. There was no such interest expense recorded for these items in 2016 as we held no preferred stock warrants or debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevaluation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nRevaluation of preferred stock warrant liability consists of the net gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. In connection with the loan and security agreement, we issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, which we believe is a financial instrument that may have required a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified this warrant as a liability that we re-measured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ on June 26, 2015, the preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase common stock. We performed the final mark to market adjustment on the preferred stock warrant using the fair value of the underlying common shares of $18.00 per share on June 26, 2015 and recorded the change in fair value in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The preferred stock warrant liability was then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it became a warrant to purchase common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2010, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively, both of which begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $13.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2031 and 2028, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits include an orphan drug credit carryforward of $8.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCollaboration revenue\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we identify the deliverables included in the arrangement and determine: (1) whether the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a standalone basis and represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting; and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner, the retention of any key rights by us, and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s) and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nIn situations where we have identified multiple units of accounting, the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over the estimated performance period as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting.\nIf there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement for the single unit of accounting on a time-based proportional performance method over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Alternatively, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the time-based proportional performance method or effort-based proportional performance method, as applicable.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (iii) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. We recognize revenue associated with substantive milestones in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method upon successful accomplishment of each milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nApplication of the above guidance requires significant judgment and requires the Company to make determinations based on the facts and circumstances under each arrangement.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 CROs in connection with performing research services on our behalf and clinical trials; \n \u2022 investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 vendors in connection with pre-clinical and clinical development activities; and \n \u2022 vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of pre-clinical and clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to pre-clinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight- line method. The Company recognizes adjustments to stock compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non- employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because we lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and non-employees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We adjust stock-based compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\n Year Ended December 31, ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with Item 6 Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs, which are designed to treat disease by restoring the function of a dysbiotic microbiome. Our lead product candidate, SER-109, is designed to prevent further recurrences of Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, infection, or CDI, a debilitating infection of the colon, by treating the dysbiosis of the colonic microbiome and, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, could be a first-in-field oral microbiome drug. Using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are developing additional product candidates to treat diseases where the microbiome is implicated, including SER-262, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent an initial recurrence of primary CDI, SER-287 to treat inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, SER-301, a synthetic IBD candidate, and SER-155, a synthetic product candidate, to prevent mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or allo-HSCT, due to infections and graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD. We are also using our microbiome therapeutics platform to conduct research on metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease; rare liver disorders such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); and immuno-oncology treatments.\nSince our inception in October 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing SER-109, SER-287 and SER-262, researching our pre-clinical candidates SER-155 and SER-301, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 8.5 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $139.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on June 26, 2015, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 22.9 million shares of our common stock. The shares issued upon closing of the IPO included 1.1 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. All of our product candidates other than SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 are still in pre-clinical or research development. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $174.2 million.\nOn July 29, 2016, we announced the interim 8-week results from our SER-109 Phase 2 clinical study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI. In that study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8 week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statically significant. SER-109 was generally safe and well-tolerated in our Phase 1b/2 clinical study and in the Phase 2 clinical study. The most common adverse events for SER-109 and placebo, respectively, were diarrhea (25% vs. 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs. 14%), flatulence (12% vs. 3%), and nausea (10% vs. 10%). No drug-related serious adverse events were observed.\nIn order to understand the difference in outcome between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and chemistry, manufacturing and control data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods, that may have differed between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We have now identified specific factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the trial. The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo. Diagnosis of C. difficile infection for both study entry and for endpoint analysis will be confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. Patients in the SER-109 arm will receive a total SER-109 dose, administered over three days, approximately 10-fold higher than the dose used in the prior Phase 2 study. The new study will evaluate patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint will compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and CMC parameters.\nWe initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of SER-287 in December 2015 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017. We initiated a Phase 1b clinical study of SER-262 in July 2016 and expect results from this study in the second half of 2017.\nOur expenses may increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we:\n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-109, our lead product candidate; based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-262 to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI; \n \u2022 continue the clinical development of SER-287 for the treatment of UC; \n \u2022 conduct research and continue pre-clinical development of additional Ecobiotic\u00ae microbiome therapeutics, including SER-155 to improve clinical outcomes following allo-HSCT due to infections and GvHD and SER-301, our synthetic IBD product candidate; \n \u2022 make strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities, including potentially planning and building a small-scale commercial manufacturing facility; \n \u2022 maintain and augment our intellectual property portfolio and opportunistically acquire complementary intellectual property; \n \u2022 begin to build the infrastructure necessary to support potential commercialization of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates. \nIn addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nIn January 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Nestec Ltd., or NHS, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn's disease. The License Agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory, and is expected to provide substantial financial support for our ongoing research and development. We have retained full commercial rights to our entire portfolio of product candidates with respect to the United States and Canada, where we plan to build our own commercial organization.\nUnder the License Agreement, we granted to NHS an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, in the Licensed Territory, certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or, collectively, the NHS Collaboration Products. We also granted to NHS a non-exclusive license to export, develop and make NHS Collaboration Products in the licensed fields worldwide solely for commercialization in the licensed fields and in the Licensed Territory.\nIn exchange for the license, NHS made an upfront cash payment of $120 million to us in February 2016. NHS has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. Additionally, NHS has agreed to pay us up to $660 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $1.125 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of NHS Collaboration Products. We received a $10.0 million milestone payments in 2016 associated with the planned initiation of a Phase 1b study for SER-262 in CDI. The full potential value of the up-front payment and milestone payments payable by NHS is over $1.9 billion, assuming all products receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. NHS is also obligated to pay some of the costs related to our clinical trials. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues from collaborations have been derived from the License Agreement.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities and general and administrative costs.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct research, pre-clinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture drug products for use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials; \n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions; \n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses; \n \u2022 the cost of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. All costs associated with the License Agreement are recorded in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOur primary focus of research and development since inception has been on our microbiome therapeutics platform and the subsequent development of SER-109, SER-262, SER-287, SER-301 and SER-155. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants and CROs in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee-related costs and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and, as such, are classified as costs of our microbiome therapeutics platform research, along with external costs directly related to our microbiome therapeutics platform.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred on our platform and by product development program.\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Microbiome therapeutics platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SER-287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of SER-287 and SER-262, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, including SER-155 and SER-301, and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future if we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also may incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of amortization of purchased premiums and discounts associated with our investments. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest expense consisted of interest at the stated rate on borrowings under our loan and security agreement, amortization of deferred financing costs and interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount associated with (1) the fair value of preferred stock warrant we issued in connection with the loan and security agreement and (2) a final payment due at maturity. There was no such interest expense recorded for these items in 2016 as we held no preferred stock warrants or debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevaluation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nRevaluation of preferred stock warrant liability consists of the net gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. In connection with the loan and security agreement, we issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, which we believe is a financial instrument that may have required a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified this warrant as a liability that we re-measured to fair value at each reporting period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ on June 26, 2015, the preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase common stock. We performed the final mark to market adjustment on the preferred stock warrant using the fair value of the underlying common shares of $18.00 per share on June 26, 2015 and recorded the change in fair value in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The preferred stock warrant liability was then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as it became a warrant to purchase common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2010, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $47.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively, both of which begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $13.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2031 and 2028, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits include an orphan drug credit carryforward of $8.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nCollaboration revenue\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we identify the deliverables included in the arrangement and determine: (1) whether the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a standalone basis and represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting; and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner, the retention of any key rights by us, and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s) and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).\nIn situations where we have identified multiple units of accounting, the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over the estimated performance period as the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting.\nIf there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement for the single unit of accounting on a time-based proportional performance method over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Alternatively, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the time-based proportional performance method or effort-based proportional performance method, as applicable.\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (iii) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. We recognize revenue associated with substantive milestones in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method upon successful accomplishment of each milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive would be recognized as revenue over the remaining period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nApplication of the above guidance requires significant judgment and requires the Company to make determinations based on the facts and circumstances under each arrangement.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 CROs in connection with performing research services on our behalf and clinical trials; \n \u2022 investigative sites or other providers in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 vendors in connection with pre-clinical and clinical development activities; and \n \u2022 vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of pre-clinical and clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to pre-clinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight- line method. The Company recognizes adjustments to stock compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non- employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because we lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and non-employees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We adjust stock-based compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:\n Year Ended December 31, "}
