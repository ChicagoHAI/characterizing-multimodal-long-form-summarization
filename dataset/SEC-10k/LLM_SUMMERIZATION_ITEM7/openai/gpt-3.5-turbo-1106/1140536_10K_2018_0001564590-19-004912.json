MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has more than 43,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping them to determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate a private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of the periods presented.\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nMarket Conditions\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nMarket conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, remain uncertain, and the Company is currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\nAlthough approximately 23% of our revenue is generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenue is denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 21% of our expenses is denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer-sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth. In recent years, growth in the market for exchanges has slowed, and we expect this trend may continue during 2019.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nThe tables below set forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated. In accordance with the modified retrospective adoption requirements of ASC 606 (see Note 4 - Revenue within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we have also provided our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 without the adoption of ASC 606 to show comparability to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n($ in millions, except

This growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nOur revenue can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, currency translation increased our consolidated revenue by $89 million. The primary currencies driving this change were the Euro and Pound sterling.\nDivestitures in the latter part of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018 reduced revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

This growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenue by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year.\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nSegment Revenue\nWe manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration.\nIn 2018, we made certain changes that affect our segment results that are not material. These changes include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives included in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 5 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\nSegment revenue excludes amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenue.\nThe Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company's first and fourth quarters due primarily to the timing of broking-related activities. Although the mix of quarterly income changed as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we expect our revenue to remain highest in our first and fourth quarters.\nHuman Capital and Benefits (\u2018HCB')\nThe HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 38% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

On an organic basis, HCB experienced growth globally across all businesses. Health and Benefits led the segment with growth in North America related to increased consulting work and product revenue growth, while outside of North America revenue was positively impacted by global benefits management appointments. Talent and Rewards also generated strong revenue growth, primarily from increased demand for advisory projects in Western Europe and International, as well as compensation surveys on a global basis. Retirement revenue increased, driven by higher consulting and project work across all geographies. The Technology and Administration Solutions business experienced growth in Great Britain and Western Europe as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nThe following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Components of Revenue Change (i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As\nReported\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Currency\nImpact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Constant Currency\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisitions/\nDivestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Organic\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nHCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Retirement revenue increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and was partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain increased due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenue in Health and Benefits was up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits management implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nCorporate Risk and Broking (\u2018CRB')\nThe CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations.

Wholesale Insurance Broking, Investments, Insurance Consulting and Technology, Max Matthiessen and Willis Re all posted revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. Willis Towers Watson Securities' growth was flat. The reduction in Underwriting and Capital Management revenue was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio.\nBenefit Delivery and Administration (\u2018BDA')\nThe BDA segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. A significant portion of the revenue in this segment is recurring in\nnature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenue across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client enrollment activities, which often occur during the fourth quarter, with increased membership levels typically effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections.\nBDA generated approximately 9% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Individual Marketplace revenue increased by 10%, and the rest of the segment grew by 14%, led by Group Marketplace and\nBenefits Outsourcing. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces resulted from the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefits Outsourcing's growth was a result of new client wins and special projects.\nCosts of Providing Services\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $18 million. Total costs of providing services were $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million. See the following discussion for further details.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $5.1 billion, compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $156 million. This increase was primarily a result of higher base salary adjustments, increased medical benefits costs and incentive accruals. Salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.0 billion, compared to $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $118 million. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive accruals as compared to the prior year.\nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenue, represented 60%, 61% and 61% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $103 million, or 7%. This increase was primarily due to higher professional services expenses, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $17 million, or 1%. The decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in 2016, partially offset by reserves for the City of Houston and CalPERS litigations and increases in other litigation reserves and professional services in 2017.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful lives of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $208 million, compared to $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5 million. Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $203 million, compared to $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $25 million. These year-over-year increases were due primarily to higher depreciable assets bases resulting from additional assets placed in service in the previous years.\nAmortization\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $534 million, compared to $581 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $47 million, or 8%. Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $581 million, compared to $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $10 million. Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization expense will decrease over time.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs were $132 million and $193 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThese costs were incurred during the prior years and were related to the Operational Improvement Program (\u2018OIP') and Business Restructuring Program, which were completed, and for which costs were fully accrued, by the end of 2017. We spent a cumulative amount of $441 million on restructuring charges for the OIP since it began in the second quarter of 2014.\nRefer to Note 6 - Restructuring Costs within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these costs.\nTransaction and integration expenses\nTransaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $202 million, compared to $269 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $67 million, or 25%. The higher costs in the prior year primarily resulted from the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit which was settled in the third quarter of 2017 (see Part II, Item 8, Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018, as amended on June 6, 2018, for more details). The decrease in expenses in 2018 was also due to the completion of certain integration activities in connection with the Merger. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $269 million, which consists of costs associated with our information technology and finance initiatives and rationalization, property consolidation, benefits harmonization and costs associated with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $177 million. Approximately $162 million of these expenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $809 million, compared to $516 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $293 million. Adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, which reduced operating income in 2018 by $98 million, income from operations would have increased by $391 million. This increase was due to continued organic revenue growth across all segments. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $516 million, compared to $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $168 million, or 48%. This increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of $315 million driven by growth across all segments, partially offset by additional costs resulting primarily from our integration activities and additional salary and benefits costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $208 million, $188 million and $184 million, respectively. Interest expense is primarily related to interest on our senior notes and term loans. Interest expense increased by $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which resulted from higher average outstanding debt balances during the year, higher interest rates attributable to the variable-rate portion of our outstanding debt, and higher fixed-rate interest associated with the issuance of new senior notes during the current year. Interest expense increased by $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year, which primarily resulted from additional levels of indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net\nAs a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which was retrospectively applied to our 2017 and 2016 presentations as well, we now classify all components of net periodic benefit cost, except service cost, resulting from our defined benefit plans, in this line item. Other income, net, additionally includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $250 million, compared to $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $86 million. The additional income in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily related to increased pension benefit income of $58 million for full year 2018, in comparison with the prior year, and favorable foreign exchange activity, primarily occurring in the second quarter of 2018, of approximately $48 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $164 million, compared to $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower income was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange activity of approximately $43 million.\n(Provision for)/Benefit from Income Taxes\n(Provision for)/benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a provision of $136 million, compared with benefits of $100 million and $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, which included a net benefit of $204 million due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquisition-based intangibles. The benefit from income taxes in 2016 was primarily due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift resulted in additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduced the global effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 16.0%, (20.5)% and (28.1)%, respectively. These effective tax rates are calculated using extended values from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values.\nPrior to U.S. Tax Reform, our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to our global mix of income and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. For 2018, while the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate has decreased as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, certain deferred tax benefits realized as a result of both the Merger and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates have now been reduced as well. This offsets, in part, the benefit of U.S. Tax Reform, thus increasing our income tax rate.\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $695 million, compared to $568 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $127 million, or 22%. Adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, which reduced net income in 2018 by $80 million, net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson would have increased by $207 million. This increase was due to strong organic revenue growth across all segments. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $568 million, compared to $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement of $168 million in income from operations, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in other income, net.\nSupplemental Information - Adoption of New Revenue Standard\nAs discussed in Note 4 - Revenue, within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018. Since the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method, we have provided the impact to the affected financial statement line items within the consolidated financial statements for 2018; the 2017 and 2016 comparative financial statement line items have not been restated in accordance with the new standard. In an effort to help the readers of this Form 10-K better understand the impact that this guidance has on our reported segment results, we have included below the revenue and operating income by segment as reported, as well as without the adoption of ASC 606, and brief explanations of the changes (amounts exclude results not allocated to the operating segments):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balances Without Adoption of ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Effect of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> HCB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> a, e\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CRB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> b\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> b, f\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IRR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> c\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> c, f\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> d\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> d, e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExplanation of Changes\nRevenue and operating expense amounts differ due to the adoption of ASC 606 as well as how the new standard reflects the timing of our operating results.

The remainder of the revenue is recognized consistently with methods used prior to the adoption of ASC 606.

U.S. Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (1) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years; (2) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property; (3) reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u2018GILTI'), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (\u2018FTCs') and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (7) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (8) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u2018BEAT'), a new minimum tax; and (9) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries.\nAlso on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u2018SAB 118'), which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the U.S. Tax Reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes (\u2018ASC 740'). In accordance with SAB 118, a company was required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of U.S. Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. Adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts were required to be recorded and disclosed during the measurement period. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform was incomplete but it was able to determine a reasonable estimate, a provisional estimate in the financial statements was required to be recorded. If a company was unable to determine a provisional estimate, it was required to continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nWhile the measurement period under SAB 118 is now closed, the Company may in future periods need to further refine its U.S. federal and state calculations related to U.S. Tax Reform as the taxing authorities provide additional guidance and clarification. However, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's accounting for U.S. Tax Reform is complete based on its interpretation of the guidance issued as of the balance sheet date.\nAs such, the Company has revised and finalized the provisional adjustments for the following items:\nReduction of the federal corporate tax rate - Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's U.S. income is taxed at a 21% federal corporate tax rate. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets or liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods, which is 21%. Consequently, the Company recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of $208 million, with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of $208 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. On October 12, 2018, the Company filed its 2017 U.S. federal corporate income tax return. After refining our analysis of those items directly related to U.S. Tax Reform, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefit of approximately $8 million related to deferred tax items that are now subject to tax at 21%. The effect of the measurement period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 1%.\nOne-time transition tax - The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u2018E&P') that it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. At December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries owned by U.S. corporate shareholders, resulting in an increase in U.S. Federal income tax expense of $70 million and state income tax expense of $2 million. This transition tax liability was recorded as a long-term liability in the 2017 financial statements. Subsequent to the December 31, 2017 reporting period, the Internal Revenue Service (\u2018IRS') clarified the application of the \u2018with' and \u2018without' approach for calculating the transition tax liability in determining the amount payable over eight years. Based on this guidance the Company revised its provisional estimate for the U.S. federal transition tax liability in the first quarter of 2018, which was reduced by $64 million due to the utilization of interest loss carryforwards resulting from the transition tax income inclusion. This reduction has no impact on the 2018 effective tax rate. Additionally, on the basis of revised E&P computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an additional increase to income tax expense of $8 million, which was recorded in current income tax payable. This has an approximate 1% impact on the Company's 2018 effective tax rate. The tax expense recorded includes the final measurement period adjustment related to the Company's November 30, 2018 foreign subsidiaries. While the measurement period under SAB 118 is now closed, we may in future periods need to further refine the U.S. federal and state transition tax calculations of the November 30, 2018 foreign subsidiaries as the taxing authorities provide additional guidance and clarification.\nIndefinite reinvestment assertion - Beginning in 2018, U.S. Tax Reform provides a 100% deduction for dividends received from 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate shareholders, subject to a one-year holding period. Although dividend income is now exempt from U.S. federal tax for U.S. corporate shareholders, companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, we analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and determined we might repatriate up to $219 million which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of $1 million. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the associated deferred tax liability. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax. These estimates are now considered final and no further adjustments have been made in the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nBonus Depreciation - The Company completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional deduction of $40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures. This resulted in an increase of approximately $14 million to the Company's U.S. federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $14 million. However, as a result of further analysis on assets placed in service after September 27, 2017, the Company concluded its tax deduction to be $8 million. The tax deduction was reflected on the Company's 2017 U.S. federal corporate income tax return filed on October 12, 2018. The effect of the measurement-period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is included in the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate above.\nExecutive compensation - Starting with compensation paid in 2018, Section 162(m) will limit the Company from deducting compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1 million paid to anyone who, starting in 2018, serves as the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers. The only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a\nbinding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior Section 162(m) rules. Accordingly, any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive. The Company recorded a provisional income tax expense of $8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying as a binding contract exception. During the fourth quarter the Company finalized its analysis and review of the executive compensation plans and IRS guidance released throughout the year. The Company has concluded that the reviewed plans are not subject to future limitation under the binding contract exception and grandfathering rules. This resulted in the re-establishment of the deferred tax asset through the recording of an income tax benefit of $8 million. The effect of the measurement period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 1%.\nGILTI - U.S. Tax Reform creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (\u2018CFCs') must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs' U.S. shareholders. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder's \u2018net CFC tested income' over the net deemed tangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u2018period cost method') or (2) factoring such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the \u2018deferred method'). The Company has concluded it is treating the taxes due on U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u2018period cost method'). The estimated tax impact of GILTI, net of available foreign tax credits, is approximately $15 million at December 31, 2018.\nValuation allowances - The Company has concluded there have been no changes to valuation allowances as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nExecutive Summary\nOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings.\nBased on our balance sheets, cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. Beginning in 2016, as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries. The historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts.\nAt December 31, 2018, we analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded an estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or additional guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner.\nEvents that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed an offering of $600 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2028 and $400 million of 5.050% senior notes due 2048. Net proceeds of $989 million were used to prepay in full $127 million outstanding under our term loan due December 2019, and to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.\nAssets and liabilities associated with non-U.S. entities have been translated into U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2018 at U.S. dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods. As a result, cash flows derived from changes in the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents at both December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.0 billion.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2018, $1.1 billion was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $362 million, which was available to draw against the facility at December 31, 2017.\nIncluded within cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $90 million held within our regulated U.K. entities at both balance sheet dates presented.\nSummarized Consolidated Cash Flows\nThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the years ended:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash from/(used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (341\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (335\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (903\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (775\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF YEAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF YEAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were $1.3 billion for 2018, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $862 million for 2017. The $1.3 billion net cash from operating activities for 2018 included net income of $715 million, adjusted for $570 million of non-cash adjustments, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3 million. The $570 million non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $426 million increase in cash from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily resulted from increased cash collections from customers and other working capital improvements.\nCash flows from operating activities were $862 million for 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $933 million for 2016. The $862 million net cash from operating activities for 2017 included net income of $592 million, adjusted for $548 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $278 million. The $548 million of non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $71 million decrease in cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nCash flows from operating activities were $933 million for 2016, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $244 million for 2015. The $933 million net cash from operating activities for 2016 included net income of $438 million, adjusted for $590 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $95 million. The $590 million of non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, net defined benefit pension credits, share-based compensation, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $689 million increase in cash from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to cash from operations from Legacy Towers Watson and Gras Savoye.\nCash Flows (Used In)/From Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities for 2018 and 2017 were $341 million and $335 million, respectively, primarily driven by capital expenditures and capitalized software additions.\nCash flows from investing activities for 2016 were $195 million, largely driven by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of our Merger with Towers Watson, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. Cash inflows were partially offset by $303 million of fixed assets and software for internal use and capitalized software costs.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2018 were $903 million. The significant financing activities included share repurchases of $602 million and dividend payments of $306 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $66 million.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2017 were $479 million. The significant financing activities included the payment of $177 million related to the cancellation of Towers Watson shares in connection with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (consisting of the portion of the settlement equal to the value of consideration that would have been due to the shareholders at the closing of the Merger if they had exchanged their shares), share repurchases of $532 million and dividend payments of $277 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $580 million.\nCash flows used in financing activities in 2016 were $775 million. The primary drivers during the period were debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.9 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $237 million, dividend payments of $199 million, and share repurchases of $396 million.\nIndebtedness\nTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Willis Towers Watson shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalization ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, our mandatory debt repayment over the next twelve months is a scheduled repayment of $186 million on our outstanding 7.000% senior notes due in 2019.\nIn September 2018, we completed an offering of $600 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2028 and $400 million of 5.050% senior notes due 2048. Net proceeds of $989 million were used to prepay in full the amount outstanding under our term loan due December 2019, and to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nFiduciary Funds\nAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.\nFiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company's debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.\nAt both December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had fiduciary funds of $3.3 billion.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions.\nOn April 20, 2016, the Willis Towers Watson board reconfirmed, reapproved and reauthorized the remaining portion of the Legacy Willis program to repurchase the Company's ordinary shares on the open market or by way of redemption or otherwise.\nOn November 10, 2016, the Company announced the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $1 billion. The $1 billion increase was in addition to the remaining authority on the Legacy Willis program discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nOn February 23, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $400 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, approximately $399 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2018 of $151.86 was 2,627,728.\nThere are no expiration dates for these repurchase plans or programs. The following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,918,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $153.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $602 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Commitments\nThe Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Expected capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use are approximately $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs.\nDividends\nTotal cash dividends of $306 million were paid during the year ended December 31, 2018. In February 2019, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share ($2.60 per share annualized rate), which will be paid on or about April 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2019.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nApart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt and related interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving $1.25 billion credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt and related interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. pension contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations (i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Other contractual obligations include capital lease commitments, put option obligations and investment fund capital call obligations, the timing of which are included at the earliest point they may fall due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt obligations and facilities - The Company's material debt and related interest obligations at December 31, 2018 are shown in the above table. The Company's mandatory debt repayment over the next 12 months is a scheduled repayment of its outstanding 7.000% senior notes due in 2019. The Company also has the right, at its option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes by paying a \u2018make-whole' premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.\nOperating Leases - We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to ten years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements, although this activity is relatively insignificant. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPension Contributions - The Company has agreed with Trustees of certain plans in the U.K. to contribute deficit funding and minimum ongoing accrual of benefits funding and presented those obligations in the table above. These obligations exclude employee contributions and any potential funding level contributions, which are dependent on future funding level assessments. There are no contractual obligations for our U.S. pension plans. Our total expected contributions to all qualified pension plans, including amounts presented above, for the year ending December 31, 2019 are projected to be $162 million. Additionally, the Company expects to pay $60 million in benefits directly to participants for the year ended 2019.\nTax Related Liabilities -\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Uncertain Tax Positions - The table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes.

Since the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method, the 2018 financial information is presented on the basis of the ASC 606 adoption, however, the 2017 and prior comparative financial data has not been restated in accordance with the new standard. In an effort to help the readers of this Form 10-K better understand the impact that this guidance had on our non-GAAP measures, we have presented these measures as reported, as well as without the adoption of ASC 606, and a brief explanation of the changes.\nFurthermore, the compensation for senior executives under certain long-term incentive programs is determined based on the results of our non-GAAP measures for the period 2016 through 2018 calculated without the adoption of ASC 606. Therefore, to ensure transparency, we consider it necessary to also provide the non-GAAP measures without the adoption of ASC 606. This will enable financial statement users the ability to evaluate management's performance based on the same elements utilized for performance-based remuneration.\nWithin the measures referred to as \u2018adjusted', we adjust for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations.

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Revenue\nWe consider adjusted revenue to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\nAdjusted revenue is defined as total revenue adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue.\nWe have included the reconciliation of total revenue to adjusted revenue in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the resulting revenue change to the constant currency and organic changes.\nConstant Currency Change and Organic Change\nWe evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Constant Currency Change - Represents the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenue, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Organic Change - Excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as described above, the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of adopting ASC 606 on 2018 revenue.

Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nAdjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations, the tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nManagement believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items, the tax effects of our internal reorganizations, and the tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform, which are not core to our current and future operations.\nReconciliations of income from operations before income taxes to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted

Prior to U.S. Tax Reform, this was primarily due to our global mix of income and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. For 2018, while the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate has decreased as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, certain deferred tax benefits realized as a result of both the Merger and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates have now been reduced as well. This offsets, in part, the benefit of U.S. Tax Reform, thus increasing our income tax rate.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rates without the adoption of ASC 606 were 16.2%, (20.5)% and (28.1)% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur adjusted income tax rates without the adoption of ASC 606 were 19.4%, 21.9% and 20.8% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nReconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Without adoption\nof ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Additions to fixed assets and software for internal use\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (268\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (268\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in free cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily resulted from increased cash from operations and cash collections from our customers as compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, costs to fulfill broking contracts, valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, income taxes, commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities, pension assumptions, and goodwill and intangible assets. The critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption. Different estimates that we could have used, or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition (effective January 1, 2018)\nWe use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis. A brief description of these policies and estimates is included below:\nEstimation of transaction prices - This process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions. In situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable, we must estimate the likely commission per policy, taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy. For Medicare broking, Affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking, the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed. For Medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular, we base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions, and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded (referred to as applying \u2018constraint' under ASC 606). This results in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect. The transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of treaty statements, or as other information becomes available.\nProportional performance basis over time recognition - Where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis, primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements, the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project, such as the staffing on the engagement and/or the level of client participation. Our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that, in turn, affect how we recognize revenue. We recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement. Losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\nCosts to Fulfill Broking Contracts (effective January 1, 2018)\nFor our broking business, the Company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the pre-placement of the broking contracts. These judgments include:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> which activities in the pre-placement process should be eligible for capitalization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of time and effort expended on those pre-placement activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of payroll and related costs eligible for capitalization; and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the monthly or quarterly timing of underlying insurance and reinsurance policy inception dates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of Billed and Unbilled Receivables from Clients\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client's failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered, which are recorded in other operating expenses. We also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as client disputes, the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue. Our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write-off history. Facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due, general market conditions, current economic trends and our clients' ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables.\nDiscretionary Compensation\nOur compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and/or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized.\nAn estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process. Estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted, if necessary, by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre-bonus profitability for the year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based\non available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company's facts and assumptions change. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations. We place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Accrued Liabilities\nWe have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice. In certain cases, where a range of loss exists, we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.\nSee Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPension Assumptions\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries, with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the U.S. and U.K. Our disclosures in Note 13 - Retirement Benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans. Within our critical accounting policy discussion, we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below, as any variance of recorded information based on management's estimates would be immaterial.\nDescriptions of our U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise 90% of our projected benefit obligations and 94% of our plan assets, are below:\nUnited States\nLegacy Willis - This plan was frozen in 2009. Approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United States have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan.\nWillis Towers Watson Plan - Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in this plan. Benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design. The original stable value design came into effect on January 1, 2012. Existing plan participants as of July 1, 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions, and all newly eligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2% of pay to participate in the plan.\nUnited Kingdom\nLegacy Willis - This plan covers approximately one-third of the Legacy Willis employees in the United Kingdom. The plan is now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan.\nLegacy Towers Watson - Benefit accruals earned under the Legacy Watson Wyatt defined benefit plan (predominantly pension benefits) ceased on February 28, 2015, although benefits earned prior to January 1, 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the Company. Benefit accruals earned under the legacy Towers Perrin defined benefit plan (predominantly lump sum benefits) were frozen on March 31, 2008. All participants now accrue defined contribution benefits.\nLegacy Miller - The plan provides retirement benefits based on members' salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme.\nThe determination of the Company's obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that, given the longevity of the plans, are long-term in focus. A change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation. However, certain of these changes, such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, are not recognized immediately in net income, but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost/(income) generally based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan's active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation.\nWillis Towers Watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions, including economic forecasts, relevant benchmarks, historical trends, portfolio composition and peer company comparisons. These assumptions, used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate. A discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved, whereas an expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long-term target asset allocations are revised. To calculate the discount rate, we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost. The expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weighted-average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, and the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases.\nFunding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes, or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the U.K. plans. Since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes, pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost.\nWe recorded a combined $173 million net periodic benefit income for our U.S. and U.K. plans for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the U.S. and U.K. plans, the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2019 and the impact to both plans of a 0.25% increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets (\u2018EROA') and the discount rate assumptions, and the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the impact of a 0.25% increase and decrease to the discount rates:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Totals -\ncurrent estimates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact of 0.25% change to\nEROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact of 0.25% change to\ndiscount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated 2019 (income):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (118\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (169\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Review\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, and the Company had nine reporting units as of October 1, 2018.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company performed Step 1 of the two-step impairment test for all reporting units. Each of the reporting units' estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values. To perform the test, we used valuation\ntechniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly-traded companies. Key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining forecast revenue and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units.\nIf the Company was required to perform Step 2, we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in Step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWhile we are still in the process of analyzing the various ASUs issued by the FASB, those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nASU No. 2016-02 \u2018Leases'\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additional ASUs have since been issued which provide amended and additional guidance for the implementation of ASU No. 2016-02. All related guidance has been codified into, and is now known as, ASC 842, Leases (\u2018ASC 842'). ASC 842 became effective for the Company at the beginning of its 2019 calendar year, at which time the Company adopted it.\nAs a result of finalizing and analyzing our inventory of lease agreements to determine the full impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements, processes and systems, the Company has determined the following:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach whereby it will recognize a transition adjustment at the effective date of ASC 842, January 1, 2019, rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We will reflect additional operating lease liabilities at the transition date of approximately $1.2 billion, as well as right-of-use assets of approximately $1.0 billion, and an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We have assessed the transition practical expedients available under the guidance and, in addition to selecting the modified retrospective transition approach as noted above, we have made the following elections:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Practical expedient package - We have elected this package, and therefore we will not reassess lease classification for our existing or expired leases, whether any existing or expired contracts contain a lease, or our treatment of any initial direct costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Hindsight practical expedient - We have elected this practical expedient, and therefore will not revisit our estimate of lease terms upon transition to ASC 842.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Short-term lease exemption - We have elected this exemption, and will therefore not recognize any right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases (generally defined as having a term of 12 months or less) on our consolidated balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Separation of lease and non-lease components - We have elected the practical expedient to not separate the cash flows associated with lease and non-lease components in our lease accounting and resulting amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Additionally, to prepare for the other required disclosures and new accounting treatment, the Company has implemented additional tools for its lease accounting and data collection processes, which were in place and effective on January 1, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of the financial condition and results of operations for Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory, broking, and solutions company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has more than 43,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping them to determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate a private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of the periods presented.\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nMarket Conditions\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nMarket conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, remain uncertain, and the Company is currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\nAlthough approximately 23% of our revenue is generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenue is denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 21% of our expenses is denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer-sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth. In recent years, growth in the market for exchanges has slowed, and we expect this trend may continue during 2019.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nThe tables below set forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated. In accordance with the modified retrospective adoption requirements of ASC 606 (see Note 4 - Revenue within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we have also provided our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 without the adoption of ASC 606 to show comparability to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n\nConsolidated Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from commissions from our brokerage businesses and fees for consulting and administration services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of our three most recent fiscal years.\nThe following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenue (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work was performed for the year ended December 31, 2018. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the next table.\n\nThe table below details the percentage of our revenue and expenses by transactional currency for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\n (i) These percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and transaction and integration expenses. \nThe following table sets forth the total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the components of the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year:\n\n (i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. \nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8.5 billion, compared to $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $311 million or 4%. This growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nOur revenue can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, currency translation increased our consolidated revenue by $89 million. The primary currencies driving this change were the Euro and Pound sterling.\nDivestitures in the latter part of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018 reduced revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant impacts to revenue resulting from any acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets out the total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the components of the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year:\n\n (i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. \nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.2 billion, compared to $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $315 million or 4%. This growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenue by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year.\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nSegment Revenue\nWe manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration.\nIn 2018, we made certain changes that affect our segment results that are not material. These changes include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives included in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 5 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\nSegment revenue excludes amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenue.\nThe Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company's first and fourth quarters due primarily to the timing of broking-related activities. Although the mix of quarterly income changed as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we expect our revenue to remain highest in our first and fourth quarters.\nHuman Capital and Benefits (\u2018HCB')\nThe HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 38% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. HCB is focused on addressing our clients' people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. HCB is further strengthened with teams of international consultants that provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries.\nThe HCB segment provides services through four business units:\n \u2022 Retirement - The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. \n \u2022 Health and Benefits - The Health & Benefits business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. \n \u2022 Talent & Rewards - Our Talent & Rewards business provides advice, data, software and products to address clients' total rewards and talent issues. \n \u2022 Technology and Administration Solutions - Our Technology and Administration Solutions business provides benefits outsourcing services to clients outside of the U.S. \nThe following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n (i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. \nHCB segment revenue for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.2 billion. On an organic basis, HCB experienced growth globally across all businesses. Health and Benefits led the segment with growth in North America related to increased consulting work and product revenue growth, while outside of North America revenue was positively impacted by global benefits management appointments. Talent and Rewards also generated strong revenue growth, primarily from increased demand for advisory projects in Western Europe and International, as well as compensation surveys on a global basis. Retirement revenue increased, driven by higher consulting and project work across all geographies. The Technology and Administration Solutions business experienced growth in Great Britain and Western Europe as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nThe following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nHCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Retirement revenue increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and was partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain increased due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenue in Health and Benefits was up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits management implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nCorporate Risk and Broking (\u2018CRB')\nThe CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics.\nCRB generated approximately 34% of Willis Towers Watson segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and places more than $20 billion of premiums into the insurance markets, annually.\nCRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership with three global offerings:\n \u2022 Property and Casualty - Property and Casualty provides property and liability insurance brokerage services across a wide range of industries including construction, real estate, healthcare and natural resources. \n \u2022 Financial Lines - Financial Lines specializes in brokerage services for financial, political and credit risks. \n \u2022 Transport - Transport provides specialist expertise to the transportation, aerospace, marine and inspace industries. \nThe following table sets forth CRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n (i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. \nCRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Revenue growth was experienced in every region. The primary drivers of the growth for the segment were new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio.\nThe following table sets forth CRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nCRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. All regions contributed to the strong revenue growth led by International followed by Western Europe, North America and Great Britain. International's growth was fueled by excellent client retention and strong new business. Western Europe, North America and Great Britain experienced good client retention and solid new business growth.\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance (\u2018IRR')\nThe IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting and discretionary management services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.\nThis segment is our third largest segment and generated approximately 19% of segment revenue for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018. With approximately 76% of the revenue for this segment split between North America and the U.K., this segment includes the following businesses and offerings:\n \u2022 Willis Re - Willis Re provides reinsurance industry clients with an understanding of how risk affects capital and financial performance and advises on the best ways to manage related outcomes. \nTable", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has more than 43,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping them to determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate a private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of the periods presented.\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nMarket Conditions\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nMarket conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, remain uncertain, and the Company is currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\nAlthough approximately 23% of our revenue is generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenue is denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 21% of our expenses is denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer-sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth. In recent years, growth in the market for exchanges has slowed, and we expect this trend may continue during 2019.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\nFinancial Statement Overview\nThe tables below set forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated. In accordance with the modified retrospective adoption requirements of ASC 606 (see Note 4 - Revenue within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we have also provided our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 without the adoption of ASC 606 to show comparability to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n($ in millions, except

This growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenue by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year.\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nSegment Revenue\nWe manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration.\nIn 2018, we made certain changes that affect our segment results that are not material. These changes include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives included in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 5 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\nSegment revenue excludes amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenue.\nThe Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company's first and fourth quarters due primarily to the timing of broking-related activities. Although the mix of quarterly income changed as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we expect our revenue to remain highest in our first and fourth quarters.\nHuman Capital and Benefits (\u2018HCB')\nThe HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 38% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. HCB is focused on addressing our clients' people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. HCB is further strengthened with teams of international consultants that provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries.\nThe HCB segment provides services through four business units:\n \u2022 Retirement - The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. \n \u2022 Health and Benefits - The Health & Benefits business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. \n \u2022 Talent & Rewards - Our Talent & Rewards business provides advice, data, software and products to address clients' total rewards and talent issues. \n \u2022 Technology and Administration Solutions - Our Technology and Administration Solutions business provides benefits outsourcing services to clients outside of the U.S. \nThe following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Components of Revenue Change (i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As\nReported\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Currency\nImpact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Constant Currency\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impact of ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisitions/\nDivestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Organic\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. \nHCB segment revenue for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.2 billion. On an organic basis, HCB experienced growth globally across all businesses. Health and Benefits led the segment with growth in North America related to increased consulting work and product revenue growth, while outside of North America revenue was positively impacted by global benefits management appointments. Talent and Rewards also generated strong revenue growth, primarily from increased demand for advisory projects in Western Europe and International, as well as compensation surveys on a global basis. Retirement revenue increased, driven by higher consulting and project work across all geographies. The Technology and Administration Solutions business experienced growth in Great Britain and Western Europe as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nThe following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Components of Revenue Change (i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As\nReported\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Currency\nImpact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Constant Currency\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisitions/\nDivestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Organic\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nHCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Retirement revenue increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and was partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain increased due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenue in Health and Benefits was up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits management implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nCorporate Risk and Broking (\u2018CRB')\nThe CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations.
