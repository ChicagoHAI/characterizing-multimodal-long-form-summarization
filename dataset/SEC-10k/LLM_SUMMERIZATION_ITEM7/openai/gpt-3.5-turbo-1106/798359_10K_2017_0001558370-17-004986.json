Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate on a fiscal year ending on April 30. The following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a self-advised equity REIT engaged in owning and operating income-producing real properties. Our investments include multifamily, healthcare and other properties located primarily in the Midwest states of Minnesota and North Dakota. In June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and our intention to sell our remaining commercial properties, which consist primarily of healthcare properties.\nAs of April 30, 2017, we held for investment 87 multifamily properties containing 12,885 apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $1.0 billion, and 42 commercial properties, consisting of healthcare, industrial, office and retail, containing approximately 2.6 million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $309.1 million. As of April 30, 2017, we held for sale 13 multifamily properties, consisting of 327 units, and 4 commercial properties.\nOur primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multifamily and commercial leases. Our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy. This strategy is implemented by growing income-producing assets in desired geographical markets in real estate classes we believe will provide a consistent return on investment for our shareholders. We have paid quarterly distributions continuously since our first distribution in 1971.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReal Estate. Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, less an adjustment for impairment, if any. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. As described further below, the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by management. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 20-40 year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a 5-12 year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.\nUpon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets (including land, buildings and personal property), which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and consider whether there were significant intangible assets acquired (for example, above-and below-market leases, the value of acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed liabilities, and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. The as-if-vacant value is allocated to land, buildings and personal property based on management's determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. Land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately or based on a relative fair value allocation if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition.\nOther intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based upon our evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases. Factors considered in the fair value analysis include an estimate of carrying costs and foregone rental income during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, consideration of current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information about each property obtained during our pre-\nacquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe follow the real estate project costs guidance in ASC 970, Real Estate - General in accounting for the costs of development and re-development projects. As real estate is undergoing development or redevelopment, all project costs directly associated with and attributable to the development and construction of a project, including interest expense and real estate tax expense, are capitalized to the cost of the real property. The capitalization period begins when development activities and expenditures begin and ends upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements (in the case of commercial properties) or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy (in the case of multifamily properties). General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers, we receive sufficient consideration and we have no significant continuing involvement with the property sold.\nReal Estate Held For Sale. Properties are classified as held for sale when they meet the necessary criteria, which include: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset and (b) the sale of the asset is probable and expected to be completed within one year. We generally consider these criteria met when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Trustees, there are no known significant contingencies related to the sale and management believes it is probable that the sale will be completed within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nWe report in discontinued operations the results of operations and the related gains or losses on the sales of properties that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and meet the classification of a discontinued operation as described in ASC 205 - Presentation of Financial Statements and ASC 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under this standard, a disposal (or classification as held for sale) of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.\nImpairment. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. The impairment evaluation is performed on assets by property such that assets for a property form an asset group. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset group and legal and environmental concerns. If indicators exist, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset group against the carrying amount of that asset group. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset group. If our anticipated holding period for properties, the estimated fair value of properties or other factors change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts (approximately $210,000 as of April 30, 2017) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight-lining of rents (approximately $340,000 as of April 30, 2017). The straight-lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. If estimates differ from actual results, reported results would be impacted.\nRevenue Recognition. We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBase Rents - income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis, which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases. Certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease. Rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, we record a receivable from tenants for rents that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable. When we acquire a property, the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. Revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management's assumptions relating to such tenant's viability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Rents - income arising from healthcare tenant leases which are contingent upon the gross revenue of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., gross revenue thresholds have been achieved).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense Reimbursement Income - revenue arising from tenant leases, which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes. We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We intend to distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.\nWe have one TRS, acquired during fiscal year 2014, which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates. For fiscal year 2017, we estimate that the TRS will have no taxable income. There were no income tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our TRS for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOur taxable income is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our tenants perform their obligations under their leases and our tax and accounting positions do not change. These factors, which impact our taxable income, are subject to change and many are outside of our control. If actual results vary, our taxable income may change.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal 2017 Significant Events and Transactions\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we have successfully completed the following significant transactions, including development, disposition and financing transactions, and experienced the following significant events:\nImplementation of our Strategic Plan:\nIn June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and to sell our remaining commercial properties. During fiscal year 2017, we sold 32 of our 34 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property and 1 industrial property as part of our strategic plan.\nAcquisitions, Dispositions and Development Project Placed in Service:\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we purchased the remaining 41.41% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price of $4.9 million and we added approximately 443 apartment units to our multifamily portfolio, through the placement in service of our 71 France and Monticello Crossings multifamily development projects. 71 France is owned by a joint venture entity in which we currently have an approximately 52.6% interest. The joint venture is consolidated in our financial statements.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we sold 1 multifamily property, 32 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property, 1 industrial property and 2 parcels of unimproved land for sales prices totaling $286.9 million.\nShare Repurchase Program:\nOn December 7, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50 million of our common shares and/or Series B preferred shares over a one year period. Under this program, we may repurchase the shares in open-market purchases including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, as determined by management and in accordance with federal securities law requirements. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the executive management team. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, we repurchased approximately 778,000 common shares through open market purchases for an aggregate total of approximately $4.5 million.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Shares:\nOn September 1, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the redemption of all of the Series A preferred shares. On November 1, 2016, we delivered notice to holders of the Series A preferred shares that we intended to redeem all 1,150,000 Series A preferred shares at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus any accrued but unpaid distributions per share up to and including the redemption date of December 2, 2016. On December 2, 2016, we completed the redemption of the Series A preferred shares for an aggregate redemption price of $29.2 million, and such shares are no longer deemed outstanding as of such date and were delisted from trading on the NYSE.\nNew Credit Agreement:\nIn January 2017, our Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement for a new unsecured, variable interest rate Line of Credit with BMO Harris Bank N.A. as lead agent bank and book runner (the BMO Line of Credit\u201d). The BMO Line of Credit contains a $250 million accordion option, which exercise is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. However, the maximum borrowing capacity of the BMO Line of Credit is based on the value of an unencumbered asset pool ( UAP\u201d). The UAP may not consist of less than 15 properties that meet certain eligibility criteria, and eligible properties may be added and removed from the UAP subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The BMO Line of Credit is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, the general partner of our Operating Partnership and each subsidiary that owns a UAP property. Borrowings under the BMO Line of Credit accrue interest at a rate based either on a margin percentage over the Lender's Base Rate, ranging from 0.6% to 1.25%, or on a margin percentage over LIBOR, ranging from 1.6% to 2.25%, based on our total leverage ratio. The BMO Line of Credit has a termination date of January 31, 2021, which may be extended for an additional one year period subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The line also requires the payment of customary fees and contains covenants, representations, warranties and events of default\ncustomary for credit facilities of this type, including a covenant on a fiscal quarterly-end basis that the consolidated leverage ratio will not be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. Participants, as of April 30, 2017, included the following financial institutions: BMO Harris Bank N.A., KeyBank, National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, Royal Bank of Canada, U.S. Bank National Association, Associated Bank, National Association, Bank of North Dakota and Raymond James Bank, N.A.; with KeyBank, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association as syndication agents and BMO Capital Markets Corp., Keybanc Capital Markets Inc. and PNC Capital Markets, LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners. As of April 30, 2017, the line had a credit limit of $206.0 million, of which $57.1 million was drawn on the line at an interest rate of 2.74%.\nAdjusted the Dividend:\nOur Board of Trustees adjusted the quarterly per share/unit dividend effective with the dividend paid on January 3, 2017 from $0.13 to $0.07.\nChanges in our Executive Officers:\nOn August 1, 2016, Mark W. Reiling resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. On August 8, 2016, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., as our President and Chief Investment Officer.\nOn April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Diane K. Bryantt resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also on April 27, 2017, Ted E. Holmes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael A. Bosh, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary, notified the Board of their intention to resign their respective positions. The Company entered into separate retention arrangements with Mr. Holmes and Mr. Bosh pursuant to which they have agreed to remain with the Company until July 31, 2017, the end of the Company's first fiscal quarter, to assist in transition matters.\nOn April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., our President and Chief Investment Officer, to the additional position of Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed John A. Kirchmann as the Company's Executive Vice President effective April 30, 2017. Mr. Kirchmann is expected to become the Company's Chief Financial Officer following the departure of Mr. Holmes. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Anne Olson as the Company's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective April 30, 2017.\nChanges in our Board of Trustees:\nOn June 22, 2016, trustee Stephen L. Stenehjem notified our Board of Trustees that he did not intend to stand for re-election at the Annual Shareholder Meeting on September 20, 2016. On January 20, 2017, Jeffrey K. Woodbury resigned from our Board of Trustees.\nOn April 27, 2017, Jeffrey L. Miller stepped down from his position Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Mr. Miller will continue as a member of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees appointed Jeffrey P. Caira to succeed Mr. Miller as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, effective immediately. Also on April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as a trustee and the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr. as a trustee.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\nThe demand for investment and institutional quality real estate in our markets is strong. Investors have abundant equity and access to debt to facilitate acquisitions and developments, though anecdotally we sense that development capital, particularly debt capital, is moderating due, in part, to heightened supply concerns among lenders. Prices and sales volumes are strong. Fundamentals are favorable across property types. The exception for us is in various North Dakota markets where energy and commodity market weakness coupled with increased supply caused us to experience elevated vacancies and offer lower rents to attract residents.\nWe experienced generally stable trends across most of our apartment investments during the quarter ended April 30, 2017, except in certain commodity and supply impacted markets. Our ability to maintain occupancy levels and raise rents remains dependent on continued healthy employment and wage growth. We continue to observe considerable\nmultifamily development activity in our markets, and as this new construction is completed, we will experience increased competition for residents. Many existing apartment owners of modestly older properties are making significant upgrades to their units and raising rents.\nOur healthcare segment consists of medical office properties. The same-store healthcare segment remains stable with occupancy at 92.1%. A significant portion of our medical office portfolio is on campus and located in the Minneapolis Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA\u201d) which had an 8.8% on campus vacancy rate as of the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 according to Colliers International\nSame-Store and Non-Same-Store Properties\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided certain information on a same-store and non-same-store properties basis. Information provided on a same-store properties basis includes the results of properties that we have owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared (except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as held for sale and development or re-development properties which have not achieved a target level of occupancy of 90% for multifamily properties and 85% for commercial properties).\nFor the comparison of fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, all or a portion of 52 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 12 were redevelopment or in-service development properties. For the fiscal year 2017 to 2016 comparison, all or a portion of 18 properties were added to non-same-store, all or a portion of 8 properties were moved to same-store compared to the designations for the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison and 18 non-same-store properties from the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison were sold. For the comparison of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, all or a portion of 60 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 16 were redevelopment or in-service development properties.\nWhile there are judgments to be made regarding changes in designation, we typically move properties from same-store to non-same-store when redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact on property net operating income within the fiscal year. Sold properties and properties designated as held for sale are moved to the non-same store category when so classified, and acquisitions are moved to same-store once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion. Our development projects in progress are not included in our non-same-store properties category until they are placed in-service, which occurs upon the substantial completion of a commercial property and when a multifamily development project is tenantable, generally upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. They are then subsequently moved from non-same-store to same-store when the property has been in-service for the entirety of both periods being compared and has reached the target level of occupancy specified above.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended

Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by 10.0% to $64.8 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $58.9 million in fiscal year 2016. $3.5 million of the increase was attributable to non-same-store properties. Same-store properties accounted for $2.4 million of the increase, which was primarily driven by a $1.4 million increase in snow removal costs and other maintenance items and an increase of $713,000 in the provision for bad debts.\nProperty operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by 9.9% to $58.9 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $53.5 million in fiscal year 2015. $4.0 million of the increase was attributable to non-same-store properties. Same-store properties accounted for $1.3 million of the increase, which was primarily driven by increased labor costs in certain of our markets and general maintenance expense.\nReal Estate Taxes. Real estate taxes increased by 16.5% to $23.6 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $20.2 million in fiscal year 2016. An increase of $2.5 million was attributable to the addition of new income-producing real estate properties, while same-store properties saw an increase of approximately $797,000 compared to the prior fiscal year.\nReal estate taxes increased by 3.3% to $20.2 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $19.6 million in fiscal year 2015. An increase of $732,000 was attributable to the addition of new income-producing real estate properties, while same-store properties realized a decrease of $93,000 when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 10.4% to $55.0 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $49.8 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of depreciable assets from acquisitions, development projects placed in service, capital improvements and tenant improvements during fiscal years 2017 and 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by 16.5% to $49.8 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $42.8 million in fiscal year 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of depreciable assets from acquisitions, development projects placed in service, capital improvements and tenant improvements during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments. During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred impairment losses of $57.0 million, $5.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in continuing operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 7.2% to $12.1 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $11.3 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase is primarily a result of severance costs for departing officers and employees, net of a decrease in share based compensation expense due to forfeitures, as well as an increase in health insurance expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by 4.7% to $11.3 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $11.8 million in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense.\nAcquisition and Investment Related Costs. Acquisition and investment related costs in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $3.3 million, $830,000 and $362,000, respectively. The increase between years was primarily due to the write-off of development pursuit costs.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses increased 70.2% to $3.8 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $2.2 million in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to increased legal and consulting expenses. Other expenses increased 35.5% to $2.2 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $1.6 million in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increased legal and consulting expenses.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased 15.0% to $41.1 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $35.8 million in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to an increase in mortgage interest net of a decrease in capitalized construction interest and a decrease in interest on construction loans.\nInterest expense increased 3.8% to $35.8 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to an increase in mortgage interest and interest on construction loans net of a decrease in interest expense on our line of credit.\nInterest Income and Other Income. We recorded interest income in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $369,000, $81,000 and $62,000, respectively. The increase in interest income from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to interest earned on notes receivable from our joint venture partners.\nOther income consists of real estate tax appeal refunds and other miscellaneous income. We earned other income in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $807,000, $317,000 and $718,000, respectively. The higher amount of other income in fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was primarily due to an increase in real estate tax appeal and other refunds.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate and Other Investments. In fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded gains on sale of real estate and other investments in continuing operations of $18.7 million, $9.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively.\nGain on Bargain Purchase. On March 22, 2016, we acquired a multifamily property in Rochester, MN, which had a fair value at acquisition of approximately $36.3 million, as appraised by a third party. The consideration exchanged for the property consisted of $15.0 million cash and approximately 2.5 million units, valued at approximately $17.8 million. The fair value of the units was based on the closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date of $7.09 per share. The acquisition resulted in a gain on bargain purchase because the fair value of assets acquired exceeded the total of the fair value of the consideration paid by approximately $3.4 million. The seller accepted consideration below the fair value of the property in order to do a partial tax-deferred exchange for units.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations. Income from discontinued operations in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $68.7 million, $59.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively. We realized a gain on sale of discontinued operations for\nfiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $56.1 million, $23.8 million and $0, respectively. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information on discontinued operations.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy as of April 30, 2017 compared to April 30, 2016 decreased 0.7% in our multifamily segment and decreased 3.1% in our healthcare segment on a same-store basis. Occupancy represents the actual number of units or square footage leased divided by the total number of units or square footage at the end of the period.\nOccupancy Levels on a Same-Store Properties and All Properties Basis:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSame-Store Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAll Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMultifamily\n</td> <td>\n94.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n94.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n95.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n93.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n90.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n92.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHealthcare\n</td> <td>\n92.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n95.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n95.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n92.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n89.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n91.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income ( NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure which we define as total real estate revenues less real estate expenses (which consist of utilities, maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, property management expenses and other property expenses). We believe that NOI is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT's operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation, amortization, financing and general and administrative expense. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance.\nThe following tables show real estate revenues, real estate operating expenses, and NOI by reportable operating segment for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. For a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to net income as reported, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a same-store property and non-same-store property basis. Same-store properties are properties owned or in service for the entirety of the periods being compared, and, in the case of development or re-development properties, which have achieved a target level of occupancy of 90% for multifamily properties and 85% for commercial properties. This comparison allows us to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income. Management believes that measuring performance on a same-store property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our properties are performing year over year. Management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income, renewing the leases of existing tenants, controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements. The discussion below focuses on the main factors affecting real estate revenue and real estate expenses from same-store properties, since changes from one fiscal year to another in real estate revenue and expenses from non-same-store properties are due to the addition of those properties to our real estate portfolio, and accordingly provide less useful information for evaluating the ongoing operational performance of our real estate portfolio.\nAll Segments\nThe following table of selected operating data reconciles NOI to net income and provides the basis for our discussion of NOI by segment in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

segment follows.\nMultifamily\nReal estate revenue from same-store properties in our multifamily segment decreased by 1.5% or $1.6 million in the twelve months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. A decrease of $2.0 million was attributable to increased vacancy, primarily in our energy impacted markets of Williston, North Dakota and Minot, North Dakota. This decrease in revenue was offset by an increase of $1.1 million that was the result of a ratio utility billings system implemented in the current year to recapture tenant utility expenses.\nReal estate expenses at same-store properties increased by 2.4% or $1.2 million in the twelve months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The primary factors were increased administrative and maintenance expenses of $810,000 and $911,000, respectively, due to increased labor costs and snow removal. These increases were offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of $267,000, due to a decrease in insurance premiums as well as a decrease in deductibles paid on insurance claims.\nReal estate revenue from same-store properties in our multifamily segment decreased by 0.5% or $544,000 in the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. A decrease of $913,000 was attributable to increased vacancy, primarily in our energy impacted markets of Williston, North Dakota and Minot, North Dakota. This decrease in revenue was offset by an increase of $332,000 that was the result of a ratio utility billings system implemented in the current year to recapture tenant utility expenses. All other real estate revenue items combined increased by $37,000.\nReal estate expenses at same-store properties increased by 5.3% or $2.4 million in the twelve months ended April 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The primary factors were increased administrative expenses of $1.9 million and increased maintenance expenses of $987,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of $611,000 while all other expenses combined increased by $132,000 when compared to the prior year. The increase in administrative expenses was due to increased internal property management and labor costs while the increase in maintenance expenses was due to more general maintenance items being completed when compared to the prior year. The decrease in insurance expenses was due to a decrease in insurance premiums as well as a decrease in deductibles paid on insurance claims.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Our results of operations are dependent on, among other factors, the economic health of our tenants. We attempt to mitigate tenant credit risk by working to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting criteria and monitoring our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. We believe that our credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that no individual tenant accounts for more than 3% of our total real estate rentals.\nAs of April 30, 2017, 13 of our 42 commercial properties held for investment, along with two held for sale properties, were leased under triple net leases under which the tenant pays a monthly lump sum base rent as well as all costs associated with the property, including property taxes, insurance, replacement, repair or restoration, in addition to maintenance. The failure by any of our triple net tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties in accordance with the terms of their respective triple net leases could adversely affect their business reputations and ability to attract and retain residents and customers to our properties, which could have an indirect adverse effect on us.\nWe regularly monitor the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, including our triple net tenants. The metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant's liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and to the industry in which it operates, and include the tenant's credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which it operates, that may change over time. Prior to signing a lease with a tenant, we generally assess the prospective tenant's credit quality through a review of its financial statements and tax returns, and the result of that review is a factor in establishing the rent to be charged (e.g., higher risk tenants will be charged higher rent). Over the course of a lease, our property management and asset management personnel have regular contact with tenants and tenant employees, and, where the terms of the lease permit, receive tenant financial information for periodic review, or review publicly-available financial statements, in the case of public company tenants or non-profit entities, such as hospital systems, whose financial statements are required to be filed with state agencies. Through these means we monitor tenant credit quality.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMinimum Rents\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas of April 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFairview Health Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSt. Luke's Hospital of Duluth, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAffiliates of Edgewood Vista\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrairieCare Medical LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuality Manufacturing Corp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChildren's Hospitals & Clinics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllina Health\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoran Neurological Clinic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmerada Hess\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObstetrics and Gynecology Assc\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Monthly Commercial Rent as of April 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHealthcare Leasing Activity\nThe total leasing activity for our same-store healthcare properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed during the period, and the resulting occupancy levels are as follows for the years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 respectively.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare Feet of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare Feet of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare Feet of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew Leases(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeases Renewed(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeases Executed(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOccupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHealthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n156,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n138,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n201,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n92.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n95.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe leasing activity presented is based on leases signed or executed for our same-store rental properties during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue in accordance with GAAP.

We use the definition of FFO adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT\u201d). NAREIT defines FFO to mean net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.\u201d In addition, in October 2011, NAREIT clarified its computation of FFO so as to exclude impairment charges for all periods presented. Because of limitations of the FFO definition adopted by NAREIT, we have made certain interpretations in applying the definition. We believe all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the NAREIT definition are consistent with the definition.\nOur management considers that FFO, by excluding depreciation costs, the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on our operating results. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation, that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time. However, real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. NAREIT's definition of FFO, by excluding depreciation costs, reflects the fact that depreciation charges required by GAAP may not reflect underlying economic realities. Additionally, the exclusion in NAREIT's FFO definition of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets assists management and investors in identifying the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of our investments and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. FFO is used by management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nWhile FFO is widely used by REITs as a primary performance metric, not all real estate companies use the same definition of FFO or calculate FFO in the same way. Accordingly, FFO presented here is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance, but rather should be considered as an additional, supplemental measure, and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs or our ability to service indebtedness or make distributions.\nFFO applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017 was $55.2 million, compared to $103.9 million and $86.6 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Investors Real Estate Trust to Funds From Operations\nFor the years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands, except per share and unit amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWeighted Avg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWeighted Avg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWeighted Avg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShare\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShares and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShares and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nShares and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnits(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnit(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnits(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnit(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnits(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnit(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income attributable to Investors Real Estate Trust\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess dividends to preferred shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10,546)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,514)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,514)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess redemption of preferred shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,435)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n121,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n123,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoncontrolling interests -

Management considers our ability to generate cash from property operating activities and draws on our line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand, cash flow generated from property operations, draws on our line of credit and/or new borrowings, and we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our commitments over the next twelve months. However, some of our real estate markets continue to experience challenges including reduced occupancies and rental rates as well as some restrictions on the availability of financing. In the event of deterioration in property operating results, we may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives, including\nreducing development activities, capital improvements and renovations. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, we paid distributions of $63.4 million in cash to common shareholders and unitholders of IRET Properties, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $73.9 million and FFO of $55.2 million.\nTo the extent we do not satisfy our long-term liquidity requirements, which consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt, construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities, through net cash flows provided by operating activities and our credit facilities, we intend to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which we believe will be available to us, including the issuance of limited partnership units, additional common or preferred equity, proceeds from the sale of properties and additional long-term secured or unsecured indebtedness. However, our ability to raise funds through the sale of equity securities, the sale of properties and additional long-term secured or unsecured borrowings is dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions, general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and the current trading price of our common shares. In addition, the capital and debt markets may not consistently be available at all or on terms that we consider attractive. As a result of general economic conditions in our markets, economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants, unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price, unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties, or our properties not performing as expected, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain capital from other sources, we may not be able to pay the distribution required to maintain our status as a REIT, make required principal and interest payments, make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re-development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets. In addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset values.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOn January 31, 2017, we repaid the FIB Line of Credit in full in the amount of $17.5 million, along with applicable fees, and terminated the FIB Line of Credit. On January 31, 2017, we obtained the BMO Line of Credit, which had, as of April 30, 2017, a credit limit of $206.0 million based on the unencumbered asset pool, of which $57.1 million was drawn on the line.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, credit markets continued to be stable, with credit availability relatively unconstrained and benchmark interest rates remaining at or near historic lows. While we continue to expect to be able to refinance our debt maturing in the next twelve months without significant issues, we also expect lenders to continue to employ conservative underwriting regarding asset quality, occupancy levels and tenant creditworthiness. Underwriting trends on commercial real estate have been more conservative compared to previous years and we continue to see recourse security being requested in select tertiary markets, lower amounts of proceeds available and lenders limiting the amount of financing available in an effort to manage capital allocations and credit risk. While to date there has been no material negative impact on our ability to borrow in our multifamily segment, we continue to monitor the roles of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) in financing multifamily properties and their general capacity to lend given allocations set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and their overall impact on credit availability.\nAs of April 30, 2017, approximately 14.3%, or $5.6 million of our mortgage debt maturing in the next twelve months is placed on multifamily assets, and approximately 85.7%, or $33.6 million, is debt placed on commercial properties. Mortgage debt maturing in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018 totals approximately $26.3 million. We expect to repay the $26.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We typically seek to refinance our maturing mortgage debt, although under certain circumstances we may choose to repay the debt rather than refinance, depending on the loan amount outstanding, our plans for the property securing the debt, interest rates and other loan terms available, and other factors specific to a particular property. Under present market conditions, we currently expect to be able to refinance our individual mortgage loans maturing in the next twelve months, should we choose to refinance rather than pay off some or all of these loans.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we sold 1 multifamily property, 32 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property, 1 industrial property and 2 parcels of unimproved land for a total sales price of $286.9 million. There were no acquisitions of property in fiscal year 2017. During fiscal year 2016, we acquired properties with an investment cost totaling $143.5 million. In fiscal year 2016, we sold 8 multifamily properties, 40 office properties, 2 healthcare\nproperties, 18 retail properties and 3 parcels of unimproved land for a total sales price of $414.1 million and transferred ownership of 9 office properties pursuant to a deed in lieu transaction.\nUnder our DRIP, common shareholders and unitholders have an opportunity to use their cash distributions to purchase additional common shares and to purchase additional shares through voluntary cash contributions. As permitted under the DRIP, starting on October 1, 2015, we changed the source from which common shares are purchased under the DRIP to open market transactions, which are not eligible for purchase price discounts. During fiscal year 2017, no shares were issued under the DRIP. During fiscal year 2016, approximately 821,000 shares at an average price of $6.85 per share, for total net proceeds of $5.6 million were issued under the DRIP.\nThe issuance of limited partnership units for property acquisitions continues to be a source of financing for us. There were no units issued in fiscal year 2017. We issued 2.6 million units in connection with property acquisitions during fiscal year 2016, valued at issuance at $18.2 million.\nUnder our previously announced share repurchase program, during fiscal year 2017, we repurchased approximately 778,000 common shares for approximately $4.5 million, and 1.2 million preferred A shares for approximately $28.8 million. During fiscal year 2016, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million common shares for approximately $35.0 million.\nSubsequent to April 30, 2017, from May 1, 2017 through June 22, 2017, we repurchased approximately 649,000 common shares at an average price of $5.75 and approximately 409,000 units at an average price of $5.92 per unit.\nFinancial Condition\nMortgage Loan Indebtedness. Mortgage loan indebtedness, including mortgages on properties held for sale, was $687.2 million on April 30, 2017 and $886.1 million on April 30, 2016. Approximately 91.6% of such mortgage debt is at fixed rates of interest, with staggered maturities. This limits our exposure to changes in interest rates, which minimizes the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows. As of April 30, 2017, the weighted average rate of interest on our mortgage debt was 4.71% compared to 4.54% on April 30, 2016.\nConstruction Loan Indebtedness. Construction loan indebtedness was $41.8 million on April 30, 2017 and $82.0 million on April 30, 2016. As of April 30, 2017, the weighted average rate of interest on construction loan indebtedness was 3.27%, compared to 2.74% on April 30, 2016.\nRevolving Unsecured Line of Credit. As of April 30, 2017, the BMO line of credit had a credit limit of $206.0 million based on the unencumbered asset pool, of which $57.1 million was drawn, at an interest rate of 2.74%. The multi-bank line of credit bears interest at grid pricing either at the Lender's Base Rate plus 60 to 125 basis points or of LIBOR plus 160 to 225 basis points, both of which are based on corporate leverage. The line of credit is utilized to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance property acquisitions, to finance capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\nProperty Owned. Property owned was $1.7 billion at April 30, 2017 and 2016. Development placed in service partially offset dispositions during fiscal year 2017.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents on April 30, 2017 totaled $28.8 million, compared to $66.7 million on April 30, 2016. The decrease in cash on hand on April 30, 2017, as compared to April 30, 2016, was due primarily to payments on mortgage and construction debt and repurchases of common and preferred shares, net of proceeds from sales of property.\nOther Investments. Other investments, consisting of bank certificates of deposit, was $50,000 on April 30, 2016. There were no other investments as of April 30, 2017.\nOperating Partnership Units. Outstanding limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership owned by limited partners decreased to 15.6 million units on April 30, 2017, compared to 16.3 million units on April 30, 2016. The decrease in units outstanding at April 30, 2017 as compared to April 30, 2016, resulted from the redemption of units for cash or shares.\nCommon and Preferred Shares. Common shares outstanding on April 30, 2017 totaled 121.2 million, compared to 121.1 million common shares outstanding on April 30, 2016. This increase in common shares outstanding from April 30, 2016 to April 30, 2017 was due to issuances of common shares, including in exchange for limited partnership units of our Operating Partnership, net of repurchased outstanding common shares under the share repurchase program.\nDuring fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, approximately 503,000 and 273,000 Units were redeemed in exchange for common shares in connection with Unitholders exercising their Exchange Rights, with a total value of $875,000 and $1.5 million included in equity.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we issued approximately 604,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of $2.6 million, under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan, for executive officer and trustee share based compensation for future performance. We also issued approximately 59,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $352,000, under our 2008 Incentive Award Plan, for trustee share based compensation for fiscal year 2016 performance. During fiscal year 2017, 274,000 common shares were forfeited under the 2015 Incentive Award Plan. During fiscal year 2016, we issued approximately 220,000 Common Shares, net of withholding, with a total grant-date value of approximately $1.6 million, under our 2008 Incentive Award Plan, for executive officer and trustee share based compensation for fiscal year 2015 performance.\nOn December 7, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50 million of our common shares and/or Series B preferred shares over a one year period. Under this program, we may repurchase the shares in open-market purchases including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, as determined by management and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the executive management team. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2017, we repurchased and retired approximately 778,000 common shares for an aggregate cost of $4.5 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $5.77. During fiscal year 2016, we repurchased and retired approximately 4.6 million common shares for an aggregate cost of $35.0 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $7.52.\nAs of April 30, 2017, we had 4.6 million Series B preferred shares outstanding. On December 2, 2016, we completed the redemption of all of the outstanding 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares ( Preferred A Shares\u201d) for an aggregate redemption price of $29.2 million, and such shares are no longer outstanding as of such date.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nOur primary contractual obligations relate to our borrowings under the line of credit and mortgage notes payable. The line of credit matures in January 2021 and had $57.1 million in loans outstanding at April 30, 2017. The principal and interest payments on the mortgage notes payable, including mortgages on properties held for sale, for the years subsequent to April 30, 2017, are included in the table below as Long-term debt.\u201d Interest due on variable rate mortgage notes is calculated using rates in effect on April 30, 2017. The Other Debt\u201d category consists primarily of principal and interest payments on construction loans.\nAs of April 30, 2017, we are the tenant under operating ground or air rights leases on seven of our properties. We pay a total of approximately $330,000 per year in rent under these leases, which have remaining terms ranging from 14 to 39 years, and expiration dates ranging from February 2031 to October 2055.\nOur purchase obligations represent those costs that we are contractually obligated to pay in the future. Our significant purchase obligations as of April 30, 2017, which we expect to finance through debt and operating cash, are summarized in the following table. The significant components in the purchase obligation category are costs for construction and expansion projects and capital improvements at our properties. Service orders or contracts for the provision of routine maintenance services at our properties, such as landscaping and grounds maintenance, are not included in the table below since these arrangements are generally based on current needs, are filled by our service providers within short time\nhorizons and may be cancelled without penalty. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on current information.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (principal and interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n813,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n88,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n222,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n251,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n250,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLine of credit (principal and interest)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n63,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther debt (principal and interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n934,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n244,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n310,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n258,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe future interest payments on the line of credit were estimated using the outstanding principal balance and interest rate in effect as of April 30, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nAs of April 30, 2017, we had no significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nRecent Developments\nCommon and Preferred Share Distributions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate on a fiscal year ending on April 30. The following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a self-advised equity REIT engaged in owning and operating income-producing real properties. Our investments include multifamily, healthcare and other properties located primarily in the Midwest states of Minnesota and North Dakota. In June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and our intention to sell our remaining commercial properties, which consist primarily of healthcare properties.\nAs of April 30, 2017, we held for investment 87 multifamily properties containing 12,885 apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $1.0 billion, and 42 commercial properties, consisting of healthcare, industrial, office and retail, containing approximately 2.6 million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $309.1 million. As of April 30, 2017, we held for sale 13 multifamily properties, consisting of 327 units, and 4 commercial properties.\nOur primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multifamily and commercial leases. Our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy. This strategy is implemented by growing income-producing assets in desired geographical markets in real estate classes we believe will provide a consistent return on investment for our shareholders. We have paid quarterly distributions continuously since our first distribution in 1971.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReal Estate. Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, less an adjustment for impairment, if any. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. As described further below, the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by management. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 20-40 year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a 5-12 year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.\nUpon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets (including land, buildings and personal property), which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and consider whether there were significant intangible assets acquired (for example, above-and below-market leases, the value of acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed liabilities, and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. The as-if-vacant value is allocated to land, buildings and personal property based on management's determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. Land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately or based on a relative fair value allocation if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition.\nOther intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based upon our evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases. Factors considered in the fair value analysis include an estimate of carrying costs and foregone rental income during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, consideration of current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information about each property obtained during our pre-\nacquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe follow the real estate project costs guidance in ASC 970, Real Estate - General in accounting for the costs of development and re-development projects. As real estate is undergoing development or redevelopment, all project costs directly associated with and attributable to the development and construction of a project, including interest expense and real estate tax expense, are capitalized to the cost of the real property. The capitalization period begins when development activities and expenditures begin and ends upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements (in the case of commercial properties) or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy (in the case of multifamily properties). General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers, we receive sufficient consideration and we have no significant continuing involvement with the property sold.\nReal Estate Held For Sale. Properties are classified as held for sale when they meet the necessary criteria, which include: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset and (b) the sale of the asset is probable and expected to be completed within one year. We generally consider these criteria met when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Trustees, there are no known significant contingencies related to the sale and management believes it is probable that the sale will be completed within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nWe report in discontinued operations the results of operations and the related gains or losses on the sales of properties that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and meet the classification of a discontinued operation as described in ASC 205 - Presentation of Financial Statements and ASC 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under this standard, a disposal (or classification as held for sale) of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.\nImpairment. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. The impairment evaluation is performed on assets by property such that assets for a property form an asset group. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset group and legal and environmental concerns. If indicators exist, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset group against the carrying amount of that asset group. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset group. If our anticipated holding period for properties, the estimated fair value of properties or other factors change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts (approximately $210,000 as of April 30, 2017) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight-lining of rents (approximately $340,000 as of April 30, 2017). The straight-lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. If estimates differ from actual results, reported results would be impacted.\nRevenue Recognition. We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:\n \u00b7 Base Rents - income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis, which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases. Certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease. Rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, we record a receivable from tenants for rents that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable. When we acquire a property, the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. Revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management's assumptions relating to such tenant's viability. \n \u00b7 Percentage Rents - income arising from healthcare tenant leases which are contingent upon the gross revenue of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., gross revenue thresholds have been achieved). \n \u00b7 Expense Reimbursement Income - revenue arising from tenant leases, which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. \nIncome Taxes. We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We intend to distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.\nWe have one TRS, acquired during fiscal year 2014, which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates. For fiscal year 2017, we estimate that the TRS will have no taxable income. There were no income tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our TRS for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOur taxable income is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our tenants perform their obligations under their leases and our tax and accounting positions do not change. These factors, which impact our taxable income, are subject to change and many are outside of our control. If actual results vary, our taxable income may change.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal 2017 Significant Events and Transactions\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we have successfully completed the following significant transactions, including development, disposition and financing transactions, and experienced the following significant events:\nImplementation of our Strategic Plan:\nIn June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and to sell our remaining commercial properties. During fiscal year 2017, we sold 32 of our 34 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property and 1 industrial property as part of our strategic plan.\nAcquisitions, Dispositions and Development Project Placed in Service:\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we purchased the remaining 41.41% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price of $4.9 million and we added approximately 443 apartment units to our multifamily portfolio, through the placement in service of our 71 France and Monticello Crossings multifamily development projects. 71 France is owned by a joint venture entity in which we currently have an approximately 52.6% interest. The joint venture is consolidated in our financial statements.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we sold 1 multifamily property, 32 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property, 1 industrial property and 2 parcels of unimproved land for sales prices totaling $286.9 million.\nShare Repurchase Program:\nOn December 7, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50 million of our common shares and/or Series B preferred shares over a one year period. Under this program, we may repurchase the shares in open-market purchases including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, as determined by management and in accordance with federal securities law requirements. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the executive management team. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, we repurchased approximately 778,000 common shares through open market purchases for an aggregate total of approximately $4.5 million.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Shares:\nOn September 1, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the redemption of all of the Series A preferred shares. On November 1, 2016, we delivered notice to holders of the Series A preferred shares that we intended to redeem all 1,150,000 Series A preferred shares at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus any accrued but unpaid distributions per share up to and including the redemption date of December 2, 2016. On December 2, 2016, we completed the redemption of the Series A preferred shares for an aggregate redemption price of $29.2 million, and such shares are no longer deemed outstanding as of such date and were delisted from trading on the NYSE.\nNew Credit Agreement:\nIn January 2017, our Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement for a new unsecured, variable interest rate Line of Credit with BMO Harris Bank N.A. as lead agent bank and book runner (the BMO Line of Credit\u201d). The BMO Line of Credit contains a $250 million accordion option, which exercise is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. However, the maximum borrowing capacity of the BMO Line of Credit is based on the value of an unencumbered asset pool ( UAP\u201d). The UAP may not consist of less than 15 properties that meet certain eligibility criteria, and eligible properties may be added and removed from the UAP subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The BMO Line of Credit is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, the general partner of our Operating Partnership and each subsidiary that owns a UAP property. Borrowings under the BMO Line of Credit accrue interest at a rate based either on a margin percentage over the Lender's Base Rate, ranging from 0.6% to 1.25%, or on a margin percentage over LIBOR, ranging from 1.6% to 2.25%, based on our total leverage ratio. The BMO Line of Credit has a termination date of January 31, 2021, which may be extended for an additional one year period subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The line also requires the payment of customary fees and contains covenants, representations, warranties and events of default\ncustomary for credit facilities of this type, including a covenant on a fiscal quarterly-end basis that the consolidated leverage ratio will not be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. Participants, as of April 30, 2017, included the following financial institutions: BMO Harris Bank N.A., KeyBank, National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, Royal Bank of Canada, U.S. Bank National Association, Associated Bank, National Association, Bank of North Dakota and Raymond James Bank, N.A.; with KeyBank, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association as syndication agents and BMO Capital Markets Corp., Keybanc Capital Markets Inc. and PNC Capital Markets, LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners. As of April 30, 2017, the line had a credit limit of $206.0 million, of which $57.1 million was drawn on the line at an interest rate of 2.74%.\nAdjusted the Dividend:\nOur Board of Trustees adjusted the quarterly per share/unit dividend effective with the dividend paid on January 3, 2017 from $0.13 to $0.07.\nChanges in our Executive Officers:\nOn August 1, 2016, Mark W. Reiling resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. On August 8, 2016, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., as our President and Chief Investment Officer.\nOn April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Diane K. Bryantt resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also on April 27, 2017, Ted E. Holmes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael A. Bosh, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary, notified the Board of their intention to resign their respective positions. The Company entered into separate retention arrangements with Mr. Holmes and Mr. Bosh pursuant to which they have agreed to remain with the Company until July 31, 2017, the end of the Company's first fiscal quarter, to assist in transition matters.\nOn April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., our President and Chief Investment Officer, to the additional position of Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed John A. Kirchmann as the Company's Executive Vice President effective April 30, 2017. Mr. Kirchmann is expected to become the Company's Chief Financial Officer following the departure of Mr. Holmes. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Anne Olson as the Company's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective April 30, 2017.\nChanges in our Board of Trustees:\nOn June 22, 2016, trustee Stephen L. Stenehjem notified our Board of Trustees that he did not intend to stand for re-election at the Annual Shareholder Meeting on September 20, 2016. On January 20, 2017, Jeffrey K. Woodbury resigned from our Board of Trustees.\nOn April 27, 2017, Jeffrey L. Miller stepped down from his position Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Mr. Miller will continue as a member of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees appointed Jeffrey P. Caira to succeed Mr. Miller as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, effective immediately. Also on April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as a trustee and the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr. as a trustee.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\nThe demand for investment and institutional quality real estate in our markets is strong. Investors have abundant equity and access to debt to facilitate acquisitions and developments, though anecdotally we sense that development capital, particularly debt capital, is moderating due, in part, to heightened supply concerns among lenders. Prices and sales volumes are strong. Fundamentals are favorable across property types. The exception for us is in various North Dakota markets where energy and commodity market weakness coupled with increased supply caused us to experience elevated vacancies and offer lower rents to attract residents.\nWe experienced generally stable trends across most of our apartment investments during the quarter ended April 30, 2017, except in certain commodity and supply impacted markets. Our ability to maintain occupancy levels and raise rents remains dependent on continued healthy employment and wage growth. We continue to observe considerable\nmultifamily development activity in our markets, and as this new construction is completed, we will experience increased competition for residents. Many existing apartment owners of modestly older properties are making significant upgrades to their units and raising rents.\nOur healthcare segment consists of medical office properties. The same-store healthcare segment remains stable with occupancy at 92.1%. A significant portion of our medical office portfolio is on campus and located in the Minneapolis Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA\u201d) which had an 8.8% on campus vacancy rate as of the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 according to Colliers International\nSame-Store and Non-Same-Store Properties\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided certain information on a same-store and non-same-store properties basis. Information provided on a same-store properties basis includes the results of properties that we have owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared (except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as held for sale and development or re-development properties which have not achieved a target level of occupancy of 90% for multifamily properties and 85% for commercial properties).\nFor the comparison of fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, all or a portion of 52 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 12 were redevelopment or in-service development properties. For the fiscal year 2017 to 2016 comparison, all or a portion of 18 properties were added to non-same-store, all or a portion of 8 properties were moved to same-store compared to the designations for the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison and 18 non-same-store properties from the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison were sold. For the comparison of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, all or a portion of 60 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 16 were redevelopment or in-service development properties.\nWhile there are judgments to be made regarding changes in designation, we typically move properties from same-store to non-same-store when redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact on property net operating income within the fiscal year. Sold properties and properties designated as held for sale are moved to the non-same store category when so classified, and acquisitions are moved to same-store once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion. Our development projects in progress are not included in our non-same-store properties category until they are placed in-service, which occurs upon the substantial completion of a commercial property and when a multifamily development project is tenantable, generally upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. They are then subsequently moved from non-same-store to same-store when the property has been in-service for the entirety of both periods being compared and has reached the target level of occupancy specified above.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\n\t\t\t \t\t\nRevenues. Total revenues increased by 9.2% to $205.7 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $188.3 million in fiscal year 2016. Total revenues increased by 5.0% to $188.3 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $179.3 million in fiscal year 2015. These increases were primarily attributable to the addition of new income-producing real estate properties.\nFor fiscal year 2017, the increase in revenue of $17.4 million resulted from:\n\n (1) See analysis of NOI by segment below for additional information. \nFor fiscal year 2016, the increase in revenue of $9.0 million resulted from:\n\n (1) See analysis of NOI by segment below for additional information. \nProperty operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate on a fiscal year ending on April 30. The following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a self-advised equity REIT engaged in owning and operating income-producing real properties. Our investments include multifamily, healthcare and other properties located primarily in the Midwest states of Minnesota and North Dakota. In June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and our intention to sell our remaining commercial properties, which consist primarily of healthcare properties.\nAs of April 30, 2017, we held for investment 87 multifamily properties containing 12,885 apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $1.0 billion, and 42 commercial properties, consisting of healthcare, industrial, office and retail, containing approximately 2.6 million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $309.1 million. As of April 30, 2017, we held for sale 13 multifamily properties, consisting of 327 units, and 4 commercial properties.\nOur primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multifamily and commercial leases. Our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy. This strategy is implemented by growing income-producing assets in desired geographical markets in real estate classes we believe will provide a consistent return on investment for our shareholders. We have paid quarterly distributions continuously since our first distribution in 1971.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSet forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReal Estate. Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, less an adjustment for impairment, if any. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. As described further below, the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by management. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We use a 20-40 year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a 5-12 year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to ten years.\nUpon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets (including land, buildings and personal property), which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and consider whether there were significant intangible assets acquired (for example, above-and below-market leases, the value of acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed liabilities, and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. The as-if-vacant value is allocated to land, buildings and personal property based on management's determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. Land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately or based on a relative fair value allocation if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition.\nOther intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based upon our evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases. Factors considered in the fair value analysis include an estimate of carrying costs and foregone rental income during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, consideration of current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information about each property obtained during our pre-\nacquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe follow the real estate project costs guidance in ASC 970, Real Estate - General in accounting for the costs of development and re-development projects. As real estate is undergoing development or redevelopment, all project costs directly associated with and attributable to the development and construction of a project, including interest expense and real estate tax expense, are capitalized to the cost of the real property. The capitalization period begins when development activities and expenditures begin and ends upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements (in the case of commercial properties) or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy (in the case of multifamily properties). General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers, we receive sufficient consideration and we have no significant continuing involvement with the property sold.\nReal Estate Held For Sale. Properties are classified as held for sale when they meet the necessary criteria, which include: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset and (b) the sale of the asset is probable and expected to be completed within one year. We generally consider these criteria met when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Trustees, there are no known significant contingencies related to the sale and management believes it is probable that the sale will be completed within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nWe report in discontinued operations the results of operations and the related gains or losses on the sales of properties that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and meet the classification of a discontinued operation as described in ASC 205 - Presentation of Financial Statements and ASC 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under this standard, a disposal (or classification as held for sale) of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.\nImpairment. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. The impairment evaluation is performed on assets by property such that assets for a property form an asset group. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset group and legal and environmental concerns. If indicators exist, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset group against the carrying amount of that asset group. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset group. If our anticipated holding period for properties, the estimated fair value of properties or other factors change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts (approximately $210,000 as of April 30, 2017) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight-lining of rents (approximately $340,000 as of April 30, 2017). The straight-lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. If estimates differ from actual results, reported results would be impacted.\nRevenue Recognition. We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:\n \u00b7 Base Rents - income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis, which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases. Certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease. Rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, we record a receivable from tenants for rents that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable. When we acquire a property, the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. Revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management's assumptions relating to such tenant's viability. \n \u00b7 Percentage Rents - income arising from healthcare tenant leases which are contingent upon the gross revenue of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., gross revenue thresholds have been achieved). \n \u00b7 Expense Reimbursement Income - revenue arising from tenant leases, which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. \nIncome Taxes. We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We intend to distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result.\nWe have one TRS, acquired during fiscal year 2014, which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates. For fiscal year 2017, we estimate that the TRS will have no taxable income. There were no income tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our TRS for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOur taxable income is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our tenants perform their obligations under their leases and our tax and accounting positions do not change. These factors, which impact our taxable income, are subject to change and many are outside of our control. If actual results vary, our taxable income may change.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal 2017 Significant Events and Transactions\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we have successfully completed the following significant transactions, including development, disposition and financing transactions, and experienced the following significant events:\nImplementation of our Strategic Plan:\nIn June 2016, we announced our intention to transition toward becoming a pure play multifamily REIT and to sell our remaining commercial properties. During fiscal year 2017, we sold 32 of our 34 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property and 1 industrial property as part of our strategic plan.\nAcquisitions, Dispositions and Development Project Placed in Service:\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we purchased the remaining 41.41% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price of $4.9 million and we added approximately 443 apartment units to our multifamily portfolio, through the placement in service of our 71 France and Monticello Crossings multifamily development projects. 71 France is owned by a joint venture entity in which we currently have an approximately 52.6% interest. The joint venture is consolidated in our financial statements.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we sold 1 multifamily property, 32 senior housing properties, 2 medical office properties, 1 retail property, 1 industrial property and 2 parcels of unimproved land for sales prices totaling $286.9 million.\nShare Repurchase Program:\nOn December 7, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50 million of our common shares and/or Series B preferred shares over a one year period. Under this program, we may repurchase the shares in open-market purchases including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, as determined by management and in accordance with federal securities law requirements. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the executive management team. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, we repurchased approximately 778,000 common shares through open market purchases for an aggregate total of approximately $4.5 million.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Shares:\nOn September 1, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the redemption of all of the Series A preferred shares. On November 1, 2016, we delivered notice to holders of the Series A preferred shares that we intended to redeem all 1,150,000 Series A preferred shares at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus any accrued but unpaid distributions per share up to and including the redemption date of December 2, 2016. On December 2, 2016, we completed the redemption of the Series A preferred shares for an aggregate redemption price of $29.2 million, and such shares are no longer deemed outstanding as of such date and were delisted from trading on the NYSE.\nNew Credit Agreement:\nIn January 2017, our Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement for a new unsecured, variable interest rate Line of Credit with BMO Harris Bank N.A. as lead agent bank and book runner (the BMO Line of Credit\u201d). The BMO Line of Credit contains a $250 million accordion option, which exercise is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. However, the maximum borrowing capacity of the BMO Line of Credit is based on the value of an unencumbered asset pool ( UAP\u201d). The UAP may not consist of less than 15 properties that meet certain eligibility criteria, and eligible properties may be added and removed from the UAP subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The BMO Line of Credit is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us, the general partner of our Operating Partnership and each subsidiary that owns a UAP property. Borrowings under the BMO Line of Credit accrue interest at a rate based either on a margin percentage over the Lender's Base Rate, ranging from 0.6% to 1.25%, or on a margin percentage over LIBOR, ranging from 1.6% to 2.25%, based on our total leverage ratio. The BMO Line of Credit has a termination date of January 31, 2021, which may be extended for an additional one year period subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The line also requires the payment of customary fees and contains covenants, representations, warranties and events of default\ncustomary for credit facilities of this type, including a covenant on a fiscal quarterly-end basis that the consolidated leverage ratio will not be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. Participants, as of April 30, 2017, included the following financial institutions: BMO Harris Bank N.A., KeyBank, National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, Royal Bank of Canada, U.S. Bank National Association, Associated Bank, National Association, Bank of North Dakota and Raymond James Bank, N.A.; with KeyBank, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association as syndication agents and BMO Capital Markets Corp., Keybanc Capital Markets Inc. and PNC Capital Markets, LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners. As of April 30, 2017, the line had a credit limit of $206.0 million, of which $57.1 million was drawn on the line at an interest rate of 2.74%.\nAdjusted the Dividend:\nOur Board of Trustees adjusted the quarterly per share/unit dividend effective with the dividend paid on January 3, 2017 from $0.13 to $0.07.\nChanges in our Executive Officers:\nOn August 1, 2016, Mark W. Reiling resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. On August 8, 2016, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., as our President and Chief Investment Officer.\nOn April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Diane K. Bryantt resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also on April 27, 2017, Ted E. Holmes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael A. Bosh, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary, notified the Board of their intention to resign their respective positions. The Company entered into separate retention arrangements with Mr. Holmes and Mr. Bosh pursuant to which they have agreed to remain with the Company until July 31, 2017, the end of the Company's first fiscal quarter, to assist in transition matters.\nOn April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr., our President and Chief Investment Officer, to the additional position of Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed John A. Kirchmann as the Company's Executive Vice President effective April 30, 2017. Mr. Kirchmann is expected to become the Company's Chief Financial Officer following the departure of Mr. Holmes. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Trustees appointed Anne Olson as the Company's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective April 30, 2017.\nChanges in our Board of Trustees:\nOn June 22, 2016, trustee Stephen L. Stenehjem notified our Board of Trustees that he did not intend to stand for re-election at the Annual Shareholder Meeting on September 20, 2016. On January 20, 2017, Jeffrey K. Woodbury resigned from our Board of Trustees.\nOn April 27, 2017, Jeffrey L. Miller stepped down from his position Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Mr. Miller will continue as a member of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees appointed Jeffrey P. Caira to succeed Mr. Miller as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, effective immediately. Also on April 27, 2017, Timothy P. Mihalick resigned as a trustee and the Board of Trustees appointed Mark O. Decker, Jr. as a trustee.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\nThe demand for investment and institutional quality real estate in our markets is strong. Investors have abundant equity and access to debt to facilitate acquisitions and developments, though anecdotally we sense that development capital, particularly debt capital, is moderating due, in part, to heightened supply concerns among lenders. Prices and sales volumes are strong. Fundamentals are favorable across property types. The exception for us is in various North Dakota markets where energy and commodity market weakness coupled with increased supply caused us to experience elevated vacancies and offer lower rents to attract residents.\nWe experienced generally stable trends across most of our apartment investments during the quarter ended April 30, 2017, except in certain commodity and supply impacted markets. Our ability to maintain occupancy levels and raise rents remains dependent on continued healthy employment and wage growth. We continue to observe considerable\nmultifamily development activity in our markets, and as this new construction is completed, we will experience increased competition for residents. Many existing apartment owners of modestly older properties are making significant upgrades to their units and raising rents.\nOur healthcare segment consists of medical office properties. The same-store healthcare segment remains stable with occupancy at 92.1%. A significant portion of our medical office portfolio is on campus and located in the Minneapolis Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA\u201d) which had an 8.8% on campus vacancy rate as of the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 according to Colliers International\nSame-Store and Non-Same-Store Properties\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided certain information on a same-store and non-same-store properties basis. Information provided on a same-store properties basis includes the results of properties that we have owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared (except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as held for sale and development or re-development properties which have not achieved a target level of occupancy of 90% for multifamily properties and 85% for commercial properties).\nFor the comparison of fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, all or a portion of 52 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 12 were redevelopment or in-service development properties. For the fiscal year 2017 to 2016 comparison, all or a portion of 18 properties were added to non-same-store, all or a portion of 8 properties were moved to same-store compared to the designations for the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison and 18 non-same-store properties from the fiscal year 2016 to 2015 comparison were sold. For the comparison of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, all or a portion of 60 properties were non-same-store, of which non-same-store properties 16 were redevelopment or in-service development properties.\nWhile there are judgments to be made regarding changes in designation, we typically move properties from same-store to non-same-store when redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact on property net operating income within the fiscal year. Sold properties and properties designated as held for sale are moved to the non-same store category when so classified, and acquisitions are moved to same-store once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion. Our development projects in progress are not included in our non-same-store properties category until they are placed in-service, which occurs upon the substantial completion of a commercial property and when a multifamily development project is tenantable, generally upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. They are then subsequently moved from non-same-store to same-store when the property has been in-service for the entirety of both periods being compared and has reached the target level of occupancy specified above.\n\t\t\t \t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended
