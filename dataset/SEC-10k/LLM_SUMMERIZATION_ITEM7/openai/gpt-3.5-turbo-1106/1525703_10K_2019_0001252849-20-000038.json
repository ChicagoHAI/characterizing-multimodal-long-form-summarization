See also \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nExecutive Summary\nOn January 24, 2020, we acquired Normandy, a vertically integrated real estate company focused in New York; Boston; and Washington, D.C., and general partnership interests in three active real estate funds, for approximately $100 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs. We believe that the acquisition of Normandy will further our strategic initiatives by strengthening our platform with additional development and redevelopment expertise, deal sourcing, other key capabilities, and by increasing our access to capital through Normandy's investor relationships.\nOur primary strategic objective is to generate long-term stockholder returns from a combination of growing cash flows and appreciation in the values of our properties. We own and operate high-quality office properties located in high-barrier-to-entry markets, primarily New York; San Francisco; Washington, D.C.; and Boston. Our approach is to own office buildings that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or that will be repositioned as such through value-add initiatives, including development or redevelopment. Our investment objectives include optimizing our portfolio allocation between stabilized investments and more growth-oriented, value-add investments and development projects with an emphasis on central business districts and multi-tenant buildings.\nOver the past several years, we have undertaken a capital recycling program that has involved selling more than 50 properties in geographically dispersed markets for aggregate proceeds of $4.4 billion, and reinvesting those proceeds in our core markets. In December 2019, we acquired for $205.5 million, 101 Franklin Street, a 16-story, 235,000-square-foot office building in Manhattan that will be fully redeveloped; and we acquired for $238.9 million, 201 California Street, a 17-story, 252,000-square-foot office tower in San Francisco that is 99% leased to 34 tenants. In January 2020, we sold Cranberry Woods Drive in Pittsburgh for a gross sale price of $180.0 million. We are continuing to pursue additional strategic investment opportunities in our target markets.\nOur portfolio is 97.1% leased, with less than 3% of our leases scheduled to expire in 2020. During 2019, we leased a total of 779,000 square feet of space, including a renewal lease with Pershing for 330,000 square feet at 95 Columbus in Jersey City. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 35.6%(1)(2); 91.5%(1) of our portfolio is unencumbered by mortgages; and our weighted average cost of borrowing during the quarter is 3.48%(1) per annum. Our debt maturities are laddered, coming due in two to seven years, and $784.0 million of our unsecured borrowings can be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. From time to time when we believe our stock is undervalued, we may take advantage of market opportunities by using our stock repurchase program to buy shares and return capital to our stockholders. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $20.72 per share, for aggregate purchases of $33.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, $166.5 million remains available under our current repurchase program.\n(1)Statistics include 100% of all of our consolidated properties and our ownership interest in the gross real estate assets and debt at properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures as described in Note 4, Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, of the accompanying financial statements.\n(2)On a net basis (i.e., reduced for cash on hand), our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 34.8%.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur operating results depend primarily upon the level of income generated by the leases at our properties. Occupancy and rental rates are critical drivers of our lease income. Over the last year, our portfolio percentage leased ranged from 97.4% at December 31, 2018 to 97.1% at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth details related to the financial impact of our recent leasing activities for properties we consolidate and based on our proportionate share of properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of leases </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet of leasing - renewal </td> <td>547,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>505,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet of leasing - new </td> <td>175,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet of leasing </td> <td>722,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,072,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average lease term (months) </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement allowances, per square foot - renewal </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements allowances, per square foot - new </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements allowances, per square foot - all leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - renewal </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - new </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - all leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - renewal(1)\n</td> <td>59.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - new(1)\n</td> <td>61.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - all leases(1)\n</td> <td>59.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Rent leasing spreads are calculated based on the change in base rental income measured on a straight-line basis; and, for new leases, only include space that has been vacant for less than one year.\nIn 2019, rent leasing spreads were positive (59.9%), primarily related to a 333,000-square-foot office lease renewal with Pershing at 95 Columbus in Jersey City, a 46,000-square-foot renewal lease at 221 Main Street in San Francisco, a 31,000-square-foot renewal lease at 650 California Street in San Francisco, and a 29,500-square-foot lease renewal at 218 West 18th Street in New York City. In 2019, tenant improvements included $120.00 per square foot for the 31,000-square foot lease renewal at 650 California Street and $100.00 per square foot for a new 24,000-square-foot lease at 221 Main Street. In 2018, rent leasing spreads were positive (23.1%), primarily due to a lease extension with Twitter for 215,000 square feet at 249 West 17th Street and lease expansions for an aggregate of 199,000 square feet with Arby's Restaurant Group, a subsidiary of Inspire Brands, at One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta. In 2018, tenant improvement allowances include $115.00 per square foot for a new, 16.5-year lease with WeWork for 115,000 square feet at 149 Madison Avenue, which will entail a full-scale redevelopment of the property.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nCash flows generated from the operation of our properties are primarily used to fund recurring expenditures and stockholder dividends. The amount of distributions to common stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including funds deemed available for distribution based principally on our current and future projected operating cash flows, reduced by capital requirements necessary to maintain our existing portfolio, our future capital needs, and future sources of liquidity, as well as the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. Investments in new property acquisitions and first-generation capital improvements are generally funded with capital proceeds from property sales, debt, or cash on hand. Our board of directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 at a rate of $0.21 per share,\nwhich represents a $0.01 per share, or 5.0%, increase from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2020. The board of directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2020 at the same rate, $0.21 per share, which will be paid in March 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2020.\nShort-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2019, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of $137.4 million, which consists primarily of receipts from tenants for rent and reimbursements, reduced by payments for operating costs, administrative expenses, interest expense, and lease inducements. During the same period, we paid total distributions to stockholders of $93.5 million, which included dividend payments for four quarters ($23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and an aggregate of $70.2 million for the first three quarters of 2019).\nDuring 2019, we received $375.0 million in net sales proceeds from the sale of Lindbergh Center and One & Three Glenlake Parkway and had $152.0 million in net borrowings on our line of credit and term loans. These proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the acquisition of 201 California Street in San Francisco for $246.2 million; the acquisition of 101 Franklin Street in New York for $206.8 million; and leasing and capital projects, including those at our joint ventures, of $106.4 million.\nOver the short term, we expect our primary sources of capital and liquidity to be operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and debt. We expect that our principal demands for funds will be property acquisitions, capital improvements to our existing portfolio, stockholder distributions, stock repurchases, operating expenses, and interest and principal payments. As of February 3, 2020, we have access to $426.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current obligations as they come due.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOver the long term, we expect that our primary sources of capital will include operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and borrowing proceeds. We expect that our primary uses of capital will continue to include stockholder distributions; acquisitions; capital expenditures, such as building improvements, tenant improvements, and leasing costs; and repaying or refinancing debt.\nConsistent with our operational strategy and financing objectives, over the long term we have generally maintained debt levels at less than 40% of the undepreciated costs of our assets. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio was approximately 35.6%. Our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio includes 100% of all consolidated assets and debt, and our proportional share of assets (including basis adjustments) and debt held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs described below, our variable-rate indebtedness may use London Interbank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. The anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which might increase the cost of our variable-interest debt instruments. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans or other financial arrangements. If LIBOR is discontinued as anticipated, or otherwise at our option, our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan facilities provide for alternate interest rate calculations.\nUnsecured Bank Debt\nOur Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $650.0 million and matures in January 2023, with two six-month extension options. As of December 31, 2019, we had $334.0 million in outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.45% for LIBOR borrowings, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.45% for base rate borrowings, based on our applicable credit rating. The per annum facility fee on the aggregate revolving commitment (used or unused) ranges from 0.125% to 0.30%, also based on our applicable credit rating. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility, along with the $300 Million Term Loan, as\ndescribed below, provides for four accordion options for an aggregate additional amount of up to $500 million, subject to certain limitations.\nOur $300.0 million unsecured term loan matures in January 2024 (the \"$300 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.65% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 2.55%.\nOur $150.0 million unsecured term loan matures in July 2022 (the \"$150 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 3.07%.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2019, the $300 Million Term Loan, the $150 Million Term Loan, and the Revolving Credit Facility contain the following restrictive covenants, which are defined in the debt agreements:\n\u2022limit the ratio of secured debt to total asset value to 40% or less;\n\u2022require the fixed charge coverage ratio to be at least 1.50:1.00;\n\u2022limit the ratio of debt to total asset value to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction;\n\u2022require the ratio of unencumbered interest coverage ratio to be at least 1.75:1.00;\n\u2022limit the unencumbered leverage ratio to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on these outstanding debt obligations.\nBonds Payable\nIn August 2016, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 3.650% senior notes at 99.626% of their face value (the \"2026 Bonds Payable\"). The 2026 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in February and August based on a contractual annual interest rate of 3.650%. The principal amount of the 2026 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, August 15, 2026.\nIn March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 4.150% senior notes at 99.859% of their face value (the \"2025 Bonds Payable\"). The 2025 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in April and October based on a contractual annual interest rate of 4.150%. The principal amount of the 2025 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, April 1, 2025.\nThe restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable as defined pursuant to an indenture include:\n\u2022a limitation on the ratio of debt to total assets, as defined, to 60%;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur debt if the consolidated income available for debt service to annual debt service charge, as defined, for four previous consecutive fiscal quarters is less than 1.50:1.00 on a pro forma basis;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur liens if, on an aggregate basis for us, the secured debt amount would exceed 40% of the value of the total assets; and\n\u2022a requirement that the ratio of unencumbered asset value, as defined, to total unsecured debt be at least 150% at all times.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable.\nDebt Settlements and Interest Payments\nDuring 2019, we made interest payments of approximately $17.9 million related to our term loans, line of credit, and notes payable, and $27.3 million related to our bonds payable. There were no debt repayments in 2019. During 2018, we made the following debt repayments:\n\u2022On December 14, 2018, we terminated both the $120.0 million development authority bonds and the corresponding obligations under capital leases related to One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta.\n\u2022On December 7, 2018, concurrent with closing on the amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we repaid the $300 million remaining balance on the $300 Million Term Loan, which includes a delayed-draw feature, allowing up to 12 months to fully draw the term loan.\n\u2022On October 10, 2018, we paid the $20.7 million outstanding balance on the One Glenlake mortgage note two months prior to its original maturity date.\n\u2022On April 13, 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the $49.0 million loan principal, accrued interest expense, and accrued property operating expenses, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $24.0 million in the second quarter of 2018.\n\u2022On February 2, 2018, we repaid $120.0 million of the outstanding balance on a bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of a portion of University Circle and 333 Market Street. On May 30, 2018, we repaid the remaining $180.0 million outstanding balance on this bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of 222 East 41st Street. The settlement of a $300 million bridge loan resulted in a $0.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt to write off the related unamortized deferred financing costs.\nContractual Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations will become payable in the following periods (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,706,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>799,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>700,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations on debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>266,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,988 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,170,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,137,230 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,143,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>880,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,863,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes our ownership share of the debt and interest obligations for the Market Square Joint Venture and the 799 Broadway Joint Venture, which we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. The Market Square Joint Venture has a $325.0 million mortgage loan on the Market Square Buildings, which bears interest at 5.07% and matures on July 1, 2023. We own a 51% interest in the Market Square Joint Venture. The 799 Broadway Joint Venture has $113.2 million outstanding on a construction loan, which has a total capacity of $187.0 million; bears interest at LIBOR, capped at 4.00%, plus 425 basis points; and matures on October 9, 2021. We own a 49.7% interest in the 799 Broadway Joint Venture. As of December 31, 2019, we guarantee equity contributions of $15.8 million to be made to the joint venture, under the 799 Broadway construction loan agreement (see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying financial statements).\n(2)Interest obligations on variable-rate debt are measured at the rate at which they are effectively fixed with interest rate swap agreements (where applicable) or the rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. Interest obligations on all other debt instruments are measured at the contractual rate. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for more information regarding our interest rate swaps.\n(3)These obligations are related to ground leases at certain properties, including 49.5% of the ground lease obligation at 114 Fifth Avenue, based on our ownership interest in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns that property, and our corporate office lease. In addition to the amounts shown, certain lease agreements include provisions that, at the option of the tenant, may obligate us to expend capital to expand an existing property or provide other expenditures for the benefit of the tenant.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 17 operating properties and three properties under development or redevelopment, of which 13 were wholly owned and seven were owned through joint ventures. These properties are located primarily in New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. and were approximately 97.1% leased as of December 31, 2019. Our period-over-period operating results are impacted by the real estate activities set forth in the \"Transaction Activity\" section of Item 1, Business, including acquisitions and dispositions made directly and through joint ventures. Other than real estate transactions, we expect real estate operating income to vary, primarily based on leasing activity over the near term.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues were $276.1 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $283.3 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($21.6 million) was partially offset by additional revenues from lease commencements ($13.1 million) and recent property acquisitions ($1.4 million). We expect future lease revenues to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee income was relatively stable at $7.5 million and $7.4 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect future asset and property management fee income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nOther property income was $5.1 million for 2019, and $7.3 million for 2018. The 2019 activity relates to administrative reimbursements. We expect other property income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nProperty operating costs were $93.3 million for 2019, which represents an increase from $88.8 million for 2018, primarily due to increases in property taxes and other taxes. We expect property operating costs to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee expenses were $0.6 million for 2019, which represents a decrease from $0.9 million for 2018, as a result of transitioning one of our properties from third-party to internal management. We expect asset and property management fee expenses to vary in the future based on investing activities.\nDepreciation was $78.3 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $81.8 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($6.3 million) was partially offset by capital projects across the portfolio ($2.2 million) and recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect depreciation to vary based on recent and future investing activities and capital projects.\nAmortization was $27.9 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $32.6 million for 2018, as a result of dispositions ($3.7 million) and lease terminations and extensions ($1.4 million), partially offset by recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect future amortization to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized the following impairment losses: $23.4 million in connection with changing the holding period expectations for Lindbergh Center; and $20.6 million in connection with exiting the Los Angeles market with the planned sale of Pasadena Corporate Park. For 2018, we recognized an impairment loss of $30.8 million in connection with changing our holding period expectations for 222 East 41st Street. We expect future impairment losses to depend primarily on our holding period intentions and any disposition strategies evaluated for our other properties.\nGeneral and administrative - corporate expenses were relatively stable at $32.8 million for 2019 and $33.0 million for 2018. We expect future general and administrative - corporate expenses to remain at similar or slightly increased levels as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses were $3.6 million for 2019, which represents an increase as compared with $3.1 million for 2018, primarily due to expanding our team. We expect future general and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses to vary as a result of future investing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized pre-acquisition costs of $6.4 million related to the Normandy transaction described in Note 16, Subsequent Events, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect to incur additional acquisition costs in connection with closing the transaction.\nInterest expense was $43.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $56.5 million for 2018. The decrease results from the settlement of a capital lease obligation using the corresponding development authority bonds in December 2018 ($6.9 million), prior-year debt repayments and settlements ($5.3 million), and interest capitalization ($1.2 million). We expect interest expense to vary in the near term based on future financing activities.\nWe recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $23.3 million for 2018. In April 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the related mortgage note, resulting in a $24.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt. In May 2018, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance on our bridge loan approximately six months early, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs; and in December 2018, we refinanced two of our debt facilities, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs.We expect future gains or losses on extinguishments of debt to vary with financing activities.\nInterest and other income was $0.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $6.9 million for 2018. The majority of this income was earned on investments in development authority bonds, which were used to settle a corresponding capital lease obligation in December 2018. Interest income earned on investments in development authority bonds was entirely offset by interest expense incurred on the corresponding capital leases. We expect interest income to remain at similar levels in the near term.\nWe recognized a gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests of $0.8 million for 2018, related to the sale of an additional 22.5% interest in University Circle and 333 Market Street joint ventures in February 2018, as further described in Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect future gains or losses on sales of unconsolidated joint venture interests to vary with future joint venture disposition activities.\nIncome from unconsolidated joint ventures was flat at $8.0 million for 2019 and 2018. We expect income from the unconsolidated joint ventures to vary based on future joint venture investing activities and leasing activity at the properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe recognized gains on sales of real estate assets of $42.0 million in 2019, as a result of selling One & Three Glenlake Parkway in April 2019. See Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. We expect future gains on sales of real estate assets to vary with disposition activity.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the allocation of earnings from the 101 Franklin Street joint venture to our joint venture partner.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of Columbia Property Trust was $9.2 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2019, which represents a slight decrease as compared with $9.5 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2018. The decrease is primarily due to prior-period gain on extinguishment of debt ($23.3 million) and year-over-year impairment activity ($13.1 million), partially offset by the current period gain on sale of One & Three Glenlake Parkway ($42.0 million). See \"Supplemental Performance Measures\" below for our same-store results compared with the prior year. We expect future earnings to vary primarily as a result of leasing activity at our existing properties and future investing activity.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor a comparison of our operations between 2018 and 2017, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Results of Operations\" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), as filed with the SEC on February 13, 2019.\nNOI by Geographic Segment\nWe consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. As of December 31, 2019, we aggregated our properties into the following geographic segments: New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and all other office markets. All other office markets consists of properties in low-barrier-to-entry geographic locations in which we do not have a substantial presence and/or do not plan to make further investments. See Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents NOI by geographic segment (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>San Francisco </td> <td>83,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Washington, D.C. </td> <td>33,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston </td> <td>7,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Los Angeles </td> <td>4,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other office markets </td> <td>35,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total office segments </td> <td>257,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272,302 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>(904) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(803) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nSan Francisco\nNOI has increased primarily due to leasing at 650 California Street and 221 Main Street. From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, 650 California Street's commenced occupancy increased from 93.9% to 97.1%, and 221 Main Street's commenced occupancy increased from 87.9% to 99.2%.\nBoston\nNOI has increased as a result of leasing at 116 Huntington Avenue. From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, 116 Huntington Avenue's commenced occupancy increased from 89.0% to 96.5%.\nAll Other Office Markets\nNOI decreased primarily as a result of selling our remaining Atlanta properties during 2019.\nSupplemental Performance Measures\nIn addition to net income, we measure our performance using certain non-GAAP metrics, including: (i) Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), (ii) Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"), and (iii) Same Store Net Operating Income (\"Same Store NOI\"). These supplemental performance measures are commonly used by REIT industry analysts and investors, and are viewed by management to be useful indicators of operating performance principally because they exclude the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the cash-generating capability of our operations. Management believes that the use of FFO, NOI, and Same Store NOI, combined with net income, improves the\nunderstanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public, and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.\nNet income is the most comparable GAAP measure to FFO, NOI, and Same Store NOI. Each of these supplemental performance measures excludes expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFunds from Operations\nFFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate assets, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, for both continuing and discontinued operations. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO, or similarly titled measures, used by other companies, and may not be comparable to those presentations. We calculate FFO based on amounts attributable to our common stockholders, which includes earnings from investments owned directly; and our proportional share of earnings from investments owned through consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts who follow the real estate industry to measure the performance of an equity REIT. We consider FFO a useful measure of our performance, principally because it excludes the effects of depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. GAAP depreciation and amortization reflect a systematic reduction in the carrying value of real estate assets and, therefore, are not indicative of the actual increase or decrease in the realizable value of real estate assets. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, is beneficial in improving our investors' understanding of our operating results and allowing for comparisons among other companies who define FFO as we do.\nFFO does not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our presentation of FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of financial performance.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders of Columbia Property Trust reconciles to FFO as follows (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds from Operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to common stockholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,041 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate assets </td> <td>78,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of lease-related costs </td> <td>27,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization attributable to our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures(1)\n</td> <td>50,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment loss on real estate assets </td> <td>43,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(762) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on sales of real estate assets </td> <td>(42,030) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(175,518) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from Operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,608 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Depreciation and amortization related to properties in unconsolidated joint ventures is recorded as equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures.\nThe following significant non-cash revenues and expenses are included in our FFO:\n\u2022Straight-line rental income, net: To recognize rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term, we recognized net straight-line rental income for our wholly owned properties of $12.4 million, $25.9 million, and $31.9 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures includes additional net straight-line rental income of $1.3 million, $(0.7) million, and $(0.7) million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\u2022Amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities: To amortize above- and below-market, in-place lease intangible assets (liabilities), we recognized net increases to rental revenues (or decreases to operating expenses) for our wholly owned properties of $4.4 million, $3.2 million, and $0.5 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures includes additional net operating income for amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities of $9.8 million, $11.5 million, and $2.3 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\u2022Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt: We recognized gains or losses on the repayment of debt before maturity of $23.3 million and $(0.3) million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\u2022Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums (discounts): To amortize costs associated with securing debt from third-party lenders over the terms of the respective debt facilities, we recognized net interest expense of $2.6 million, $3.1 million, and $3.0 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures includes additional net interest expense of $(1.6) million in 2019 and 2018.\nNet Operating Income\nAs set forth below, NOI is calculated by deducting property operating costs from rental and other property revenues for continuing operations. As a performance metric consisting of only revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, which have been or will be settled in cash, NOI is narrower in scope than FFO.\nNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that NOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models, and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties.\nThe major factors influencing our NOI are property acquisitions and dispositions, occupancy levels, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.\nSame Store Net Operating Income\nWe also evaluate the performance of our properties, on a \"same store\" basis, using a metric referred to as Same Store NOI. We view Same Store NOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio. On an individual property basis, Same Store NOI is computed in a consistent manner as NOI (as described in the previous section). For the periods presented, we have defined our same store portfolio as those properties that have been continuously owned and operating since January 1, 2018. NOI and Same Store NOI are calculated as follows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-Store NOI - wholly owned properties: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property income </td> <td>4,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>254,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>(87,808) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,048) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store NOI - wholly owned properties(1)\n</td> <td>166,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store NOI - joint-venture owned properties(2)\n</td> <td>69,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Same Store NOI </td> <td>236,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI from acquisitions(3)\n</td> <td>529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI from dispositions(4)\n</td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects NOI from properties that were wholly owned for the entirety of the periods presented.\n(2)Reflects NOI earned from properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures based on our ownership interest as of December 31, 2019, for the entirety of the periods presented.

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income, as defined in the Code, to our stockholders, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding our net capital gain. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on the undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nColumbia Property Trust TRS, LLC; Columbia KCP TRS, LLC; and Columbia Energy TRS, LLC (collectively, the \"TRS Entities\") are wholly owned subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust and are organized as Delaware limited liability companies. The TRS Entities, among other things, provide tenant services that we, as a REIT, cannot otherwise provide. We have elected to treat the TRS Entities as taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may perform certain additional, noncustomary services for tenants of our buildings through the TRS Entities; however, any earnings related to such services are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must limit our investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries to 20% of the value of our total assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.\nNo provisions for federal income taxes have been made in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, other than the provisions relating to the TRS Entities, as we made distributions in excess of taxable income for the periods presented. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to property operations in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the leases may not reset frequently enough to fully cover inflation.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nInvestment in Real Estate Assets\nWe are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our depreciable assets. To determine the appropriate useful life of an asset, we consider the period of future benefit of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income. The estimated useful lives of our assets by class are as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings </td> <td> </td> <td>40 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and site improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>5-25 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>Shorter of economic life or lease term </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible lease assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Lease term </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEvaluating the Recoverability of Real Estate Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of the real estate and related intangible assets of both operating properties and properties under construction may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of real estate assets and related intangible assets (liabilities) may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the respective carrying values will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying values, we adjust the carrying value of the real estate assets and related intangible assets to the estimated fair values, pursuant to the property, plant, and equipment accounting standard for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, and recognize an impairment loss. Estimated fair values are calculated based on the following hierarchy of information, depending upon availability: (Level 1) recently quoted market prices; (Level 2) market prices for comparable properties; or (Level 3) the present value of future cash flows, including estimated residual value. Certain of our assets may be carried at an amount that exceeds that which could be realized in a current disposition transaction. We have determined that the carrying values of its real estate assets and related intangible assets are recoverable as of December 31, 2019.\nProjections of expected future operating cash flows require that we estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, property operating expenses, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, and the number of years the property is held for investment, among other factors. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assumptions used to project future cash flows, estimated fair values may differ from the values that would be realized in market transactions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment loss of $20.6 million on Pasadena Corporate Park. Upon deciding to exit the Los Angeles market, we began to market for sale our only asset therein, Pasadena Corporate Park, in the fourth quarter of 2019. In January 2020, we entered into a contract to sell Pasadena Corporate Park, and anticipate closing on the sale in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, as of December 31,2019, we reduced the carrying value of Pasadena Corporate Park to reflect its estimated fair value of $74.5 million, determined based on estimated net sale proceeds (Level 1), by recording an impairment loss of $20.6 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we recognized an impairment loss of $23.4 million as a result of changing the holding period expectations for Lindbergh Center in Atlanta, Georgia. We entered a contract to sell Lindbergh Center in the third quarter of 2019, and closed the sale on September 26, 2019. As a result, we reduced the carrying value of Lindbergh Center to reflect its estimated fair value, based on the estimated net sale proceeds of $181.0 million (Level 1), by recording an impairment loss of $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2019.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment loss of $30.8 million in connection with changing the holding period expectations for 222 East 41st Street in New York. We widely marketed this property for sale during the second quarter and, as a result, entered into an agreement to sell this property on May 25, 2018 and closed on the sale on May 29, 2018. Upon entering into the sale agreement, we reduced 222 East 41st Street's carrying value to reflect its fair value, estimated based on the net contract price of $284.6 million (Level 1), by recording an impairment loss of $30.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.\nAllocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets\nUpon the acquisition of real properties, we allocate the purchase price of properties to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, site improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases, based in each case on our estimate of their fair values.\nThe fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and building) are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the \"as-if-vacant\" value is then allocated to land and building based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. We determine the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors we consider in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions and other related costs. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses during the expected lease-up periods based on current market demand.\nIntangible Assets and Liabilities Arising From In-Place Leases Where We Are the Lessor\nAs further described below, in-place leases where we are the lessor may have values related to direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant that are avoided for in-place leases, opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease, tenant relationships, and effective contractual rental rates that are above or below market:\n\u2022Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant that are avoided for in-place leases, including commissions, tenant improvement allowances, and other direct costs, are estimated based on management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. Such direct costs are included in intangible lease origination costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases.\n\u2022The value of opportunity costs associated with lost rentals avoided by acquiring an in-place lease is calculated based on the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. Such opportunity costs are included in intangible lease assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases.\n\u2022The value of effective rental rates of in-place leases that are above or below the market rates of comparable leases is calculated based on the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases. This calculation includes significantly below-market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably assured. These intangible assets or liabilities are measured over the actual or assumed (in the case of renewal options) remaining lease terms. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are recorded as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.\nEvaluating the Recoverability of Intangible Assets and Liabilities\nThe values of intangible lease assets and liabilities are determined based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition and have defined useful lives that correspond with the lease terms. There may be instances in which intangible lease assets and liabilities become impaired, and we are required to write off the remaining asset or liability immediately or over a shorter period of time. Lease restructurings, including lease terminations and lease extensions, may impact the value and useful life of in-place leases. In-place leases that are terminated, partially terminated, or modified will be evaluated for impairment if the original in-place lease terms have been modified. In the event that the discounted cash flows of the original in-place lease stream do not exceed the discounted modified in-place lease stream, we adjust the carrying value of the intangible lease assets to the discounted cash flows and recognize an impairment loss. For in-place lease extensions that are executed more than one year prior to the original in-place lease expiration date, the useful life of the in-place lease will be extended over the new lease term with the exception of those in-place lease components, such as lease commissions and tenant\nallowances, which have been renegotiated for the extended term. Renegotiated in-place lease components, such as lease commissions and tenant allowances, will be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the new lease term.\nIntangible Assets and Liabilities Arising From In-Place Leases Where We Are the Lessee\nIn-place ground leases where we are the lessee may have positive or negative value associated with effective contractual rental rates that are above or below market at the time of acquisition or assumption. Such values are calculated based on the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place lease at the time of execution or assumption. This calculation includes significantly below market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably assured. These intangible assets and liabilities are measured over the actual or assumed (in the case of renewal options) remaining lease terms. The capitalized above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as intangible lease liabilities and assets, respectively, and are amortized as an adjustment to property operating costs over the remaining term of the respective ground leases.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from leases and are reflected as lease revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Lease revenues includes base rental income, tenant reimbursements, and lease termination fees. All of the leases on our assets are considered operating leases. Therefore, base rental income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and tenant reimbursements are generally recognized in the period in which reimbursements for operating costs are billable to the tenant. Rents and tenant reimbursements collected in advance are recorded as deferred income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIn determining when to begin recognizing rental revenues, we consider a number of factors, including the nature of the physical improvements made in connection with the lease. When we own the improvements for accounting purposes, revenue recognition generally begins once the improvements are substantially complete and the lessee has taken possession of the improved space. When we do not own the improvements for accounting purposes (the lessee is the owner), revenue recognition generally begins once the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space; in these instances, the tenant allowance is accounted for as a lease incentive, which reduces rental revenues over the lease term. When evaluating which party (lessee or lessor) owns the improvements for accounting purposes, we consider a number of factors, including, among other things: whether the lease stipulates what the tenant allowance may be used for; whether the lessee or lessor retains legal title to the improvements; the expected economic life of the improvements relative to the lease term; and who directs the construction of the improvements. The determination of who owns the improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgement and is not based on any one factor.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nDuring 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not have any related party transactions, except as described in Note 4, Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to certain commitments and contingencies with regard to certain transactions. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further explanation. Examples of such commitments and contingencies include:\n\u2022guaranties related to the debt of unconsolidated joint ventures;\n\u2022obligations under operating leases;\n\u2022obligations under capital leases;\n\u2022commitments under existing lease agreements; and\n\u2022litigation.\nSubsequent Events\nWe have evaluated subsequent events in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report on Form 10-K and noted the following items in addition to those disclosed elsewhere in this report:\nOn January 24, 2020, Columbia Property Trust acquired Normandy Real Estate Management, LLC, a developer, operator, and investment manager of office and mixed-use assets in New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C. for approximately $100.0 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs (the \"Normandy Acquisition\"). The purchase price for the Normandy Acquisition is comprised of two components: an approximately $13.5 million cash payment, and the issuance of 3,264,151 Series A Convertible, Perpetual Preferred Units of Columbia OP with a liquidation preference of $26.50 per unit (the \"Preferred OP Units\"). The Preferred OP Units are convertible into common units of Columbia OP, which are convertible into shares of Columbia Property Trust's common stock, subject to certain terms and conditions. After giving effect to the Preferred OP Units issued in the Normandy Acquisition, Columbia Property Trust owns approximately 97.2% of the limited partnership interests in Columbia OP.\nWe also note the following other subsequent events:\n\u2022On February 7, 2020, the board of directors declared dividends for the first quarter of 2020 of $0.21 per share, payable on March 17, 2020, to stockholders of record on March 2, 2020.\n\u2022On January 24, 2020, in connection with the Normandy Acquisition, we issued 128,399 of time-based award shares and 104,968 of performance-based award restricted stock units to Normandy employees that became employees of Columbia Property Trust.\n\u2022On January 16, 2020, we closed on the sale of Cranberry Woods Drive for $180.0 million and anticipate recognizing a gain on sale of real estate assets in the first quarter of 2020.\n\u2022On January 7, 2020, Columbia Property Trust paid an aggregate amount of $24.2 million in dividends for the fourth quarter of 2019 to stockholders of record on December 16, 2019.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and results of operations, including its recent acquisition of Normandy and strategic initiatives to enhance its real estate portfolio.

See also \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nExecutive Summary\nOn January 24, 2020, we acquired Normandy, a vertically integrated real estate company focused in New York; Boston; and Washington, D.C., and general partnership interests in three active real estate funds, for approximately $100 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs. We believe that the acquisition of Normandy will further our strategic initiatives by strengthening our platform with additional development and redevelopment expertise, deal sourcing, other key capabilities, and by increasing our access to capital through Normandy's investor relationships.\nOur primary strategic objective is to generate long-term stockholder returns from a combination of growing cash flows and appreciation in the values of our properties. We own and operate high-quality office properties located in high-barrier-to-entry markets, primarily New York; San Francisco; Washington, D.C.; and Boston. Our approach is to own office buildings that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or that will be repositioned as such through value-add initiatives, including development or redevelopment. Our investment objectives include optimizing our portfolio allocation between stabilized investments and more growth-oriented, value-add investments and development projects with an emphasis on central business districts and multi-tenant buildings.\nOver the past several years, we have undertaken a capital recycling program that has involved selling more than 50 properties in geographically dispersed markets for aggregate proceeds of $4.4 billion, and reinvesting those proceeds in our core markets. In December 2019, we acquired for $205.5 million, 101 Franklin Street, a 16-story, 235,000-square-foot office building in Manhattan that will be fully redeveloped; and we acquired for $238.9 million, 201 California Street, a 17-story, 252,000-square-foot office tower in San Francisco that is 99% leased to 34 tenants. In January 2020, we sold Cranberry Woods Drive in Pittsburgh for a gross sale price of $180.0 million. We are continuing to pursue additional strategic investment opportunities in our target markets.\nOur portfolio is 97.1% leased, with less than 3% of our leases scheduled to expire in 2020. During 2019, we leased a total of 779,000 square feet of space, including a renewal lease with Pershing for 330,000 square feet at 95 Columbus in Jersey City. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 35.6%(1)(2); 91.5%(1) of our portfolio is unencumbered by mortgages; and our weighted average cost of borrowing during the quarter is 3.48%(1) per annum. Our debt maturities are laddered, coming due in two to seven years, and $784.0 million of our unsecured borrowings can be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. From time to time when we believe our stock is undervalued, we may take advantage of market opportunities by using our stock repurchase program to buy shares and return capital to our stockholders. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $20.72 per share, for aggregate purchases of $33.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, $166.5 million remains available under our current repurchase program.\n(1)Statistics include 100% of all of our consolidated properties and our ownership interest in the gross real estate assets and debt at properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures as described in Note 4, Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, of the accompanying financial statements.\n(2)On a net basis (i.e., reduced for cash on hand), our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 34.8%.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur operating results depend primarily upon the level of income generated by the leases at our properties. Occupancy and rental rates are critical drivers of our lease income. Over the last year, our portfolio percentage leased ranged from 97.4% at December 31, 2018 to 97.1% at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth details related to the financial impact of our recent leasing activities for properties we consolidate and based on our proportionate share of properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures:\n\n(1)Rent leasing spreads are calculated based on the change in base rental income measured on a straight-line basis; and, for new leases, only include space that has been vacant for less than one year.\nIn 2019, rent leasing spreads were positive (59.9%), primarily related to a 333,000-square-foot office lease renewal with Pershing at 95 Columbus in Jersey City, a 46,000-square-foot renewal lease at 221 Main Street in San Francisco, a 31,000-square-foot renewal lease at 650 California Street in San Francisco, and a 29,500-square-foot lease renewal at 218 West 18th Street in New York City. In 2019, tenant improvements included $120.00 per square foot for the 31,000-square foot lease renewal at 650 California Street and $100.00 per square foot for a new 24,000-square-foot lease at 221 Main Street. In 2018, rent leasing spreads were positive (23.1%), primarily due to a lease extension with Twitter for 215,000 square feet at 249 West 17th Street and lease expansions for an aggregate of 199,000 square feet with Arby's Restaurant Group, a subsidiary of Inspire Brands, at One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta. In 2018, tenant improvement allowances include $115.00 per square foot for a new, 16.5-year lease with WeWork for 115,000 square feet at 149 Madison Avenue, which will entail a full-scale redevelopment of the property.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nCash flows generated from the operation of our properties are primarily used to fund recurring expenditures and stockholder dividends. The amount of distributions to common stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including funds deemed available for distribution based principally on our current and future projected operating cash flows, reduced by capital requirements necessary to maintain our existing portfolio, our future capital needs, and future sources of liquidity, as well as the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. Investments in new property acquisitions and first-generation capital improvements are generally funded with capital proceeds from property sales, debt, or cash on hand. Our board of directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 at a rate of $0.21 per share,\nwhich represents a $0.01 per share, or 5.0%, increase from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2020. The board of directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2020 at the same rate, $0.21 per share, which will be paid in March 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2020.\nShort-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2019, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of $137.4 million, which consists primarily of receipts from tenants for rent and reimbursements, reduced by payments for operating costs, administrative expenses, interest expense, and lease inducements. During the same period, we paid total distributions to stockholders of $93.5 million, which included dividend payments for four quarters ($23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and an aggregate of $70.2 million for the first three quarters of 2019).\nDuring 2019, we received $375.0 million in net sales proceeds from the sale of Lindbergh Center and One & Three Glenlake Parkway and had $152.0 million in net borrowings on our line of credit and term loans. These proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the acquisition of 201 California Street in San Francisco for $246.2 million; the acquisition of 101 Franklin Street in New York for $206.8 million; and leasing and capital projects, including those at our joint ventures, of $106.4 million.\nOver the short term, we expect our primary sources of capital and liquidity to be operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and debt. We expect that our principal demands for funds will be property acquisitions, capital improvements to our existing portfolio, stockholder distributions, stock repurchases, operating expenses, and interest and principal payments. As of February 3, 2020, we have access to $426.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current obligations as they come due.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOver the long term, we expect that our primary sources of capital will include operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and borrowing proceeds. We expect that our primary uses of capital will continue to include stockholder distributions; acquisitions; capital expenditures, such as building improvements, tenant improvements, and leasing costs; and repaying or refinancing debt.\nConsistent with our operational strategy and financing objectives, over the long term we have generally maintained debt levels at less than 40% of the undepreciated costs of our assets. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio was approximately 35.6%. Our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio includes 100% of all consolidated assets and debt, and our proportional share of assets (including basis adjustments) and debt held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs described below, our variable-rate indebtedness may use London Interbank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. The anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which might increase the cost of our variable-interest debt instruments. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans or other financial arrangements. If LIBOR is discontinued as anticipated, or otherwise at our option, our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan facilities provide for alternate interest rate calculations.\nUnsecured Bank Debt\nOur Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $650.0 million and matures in January 2023, with two six-month extension options. As of December 31, 2019, we had $334.0 million in outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.45% for LIBOR borrowings, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.45% for base rate borrowings, based on our applicable credit rating. The per annum facility fee on the aggregate revolving commitment (used or unused) ranges from 0.125% to 0.30%, also based on our applicable credit rating. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility, along with the $300 Million Term Loan, as\ndescribed below, provides for four accordion options for an aggregate additional amount of up to $500 million, subject to certain limitations.\nOur $300.0 million unsecured term loan matures in January 2024 (the \"$300 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.65% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 2.55%.\nOur $150.0 million unsecured term loan matures in July 2022 (the \"$150 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 3.07%.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2019, the $300 Million Term Loan, the $150 Million Term Loan, and the Revolving Credit Facility contain the following restrictive covenants, which are defined in the debt agreements:\n\u2022limit the ratio of secured debt to total asset value to 40% or less;\n\u2022require the fixed charge coverage ratio to be at least 1.50:1.00;\n\u2022limit the ratio of debt to total asset value to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction;\n\u2022require the ratio of unencumbered interest coverage ratio to be at least 1.75:1.00;\n\u2022limit the unencumbered leverage ratio to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on these outstanding debt obligations.\nBonds Payable\nIn August 2016, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 3.650% senior notes at 99.626% of their face value (the \"2026 Bonds Payable\"). The 2026 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in February and August based on a contractual annual interest rate of 3.650%. The principal amount of the 2026 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, August 15, 2026.\nIn March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 4.150% senior notes at 99.859% of their face value (the \"2025 Bonds Payable\"). The 2025 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in April and October based on a contractual annual interest rate of 4.150%. The principal amount of the 2025 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, April 1, 2025.\nThe restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable as defined pursuant to an indenture include:\n\u2022a limitation on the ratio of debt to total assets, as defined, to 60%;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur debt if the consolidated income available for debt service to annual debt service charge, as defined, for four previous consecutive fiscal quarters is less than 1.50:1.00 on a pro forma basis;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur liens if, on an aggregate basis for us, the secured debt amount would exceed 40% of the value of the total assets; and\n\u2022a requirement that the ratio of unencumbered asset value, as defined, to total unsecured debt be at least 150% at all times.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable.\nDebt Settlements and Interest Payments\nDuring 2019, we made interest payments of approximately $17.9 million related to our term loans, line of credit, and notes payable, and $27.3 million related to our bonds payable. There were no debt repayments in 2019. During 2018, we made the following debt repayments:\n\u2022On December 14, 2018, we terminated both the $120.0 million development authority bonds and the corresponding obligations under capital leases related to One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta.\n\u2022On December 7, 2018, concurrent with closing on the amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we repaid the $300 million remaining balance on the $300 Million Term Loan, which includes a delayed-draw feature, allowing up to 12 months to fully draw the term loan.\n\u2022On October 10, 2018, we paid the $20.7 million outstanding balance on the One Glenlake mortgage note two months prior to its original maturity date.\n\u2022On April 13, 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the $49.0 million loan principal, accrued interest expense, and accrued property operating expenses, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $24.0 million in the second quarter of 2018.\n\u2022On February 2, 2018, we repaid $120.0 million of the outstanding balance on a bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of a portion of University Circle and 333 Market Street. On May 30, 2018, we repaid the remaining $180.0 million outstanding balance on this bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of 222 East 41st Street. The settlement of a $300 million bridge loan resulted in a $0.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt to write off the related unamortized deferred financing costs.\nContractual Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations will become payable in the following periods (in thousands):\n\n(1)Includes our ownership share of the debt and interest obligations for the Market Square Joint Venture and the 799 Broadway Joint Venture, which we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. The Market Square Joint Venture has a $325.0 million mortgage loan on the Market Square Buildings, which bears interest at 5.07% and matures on July 1, 2023. We own a 51% interest in the Market Square Joint Venture. The 799 Broadway Joint Venture has $113.2 million outstanding on a construction loan, which has a total capacity of $187.0 million; bears interest at LIBOR, capped at 4.00%, plus 425 basis points; and matures on October 9, 2021. We own a 49.7% interest in the 799 Broadway Joint Venture. As of December 31, 2019, we guarantee equity contributions of $15.8 million to be made to the joint venture, under the 799 Broadway construction loan agreement (see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying financial statements).\n(2)Interest obligations on variable-rate debt are measured at the rate at which they are effectively fixed with interest rate swap agreements (where applicable) or the rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. Interest obligations on all other debt instruments are measured at the contractual rate. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for more information regarding our interest rate swaps.\n(3)These obligations are related to ground leases at certain properties, including 49.5% of the ground lease obligation at 114 Fifth Avenue, based on our ownership interest in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns that property, and our corporate office lease. In addition to the amounts shown, certain lease agreements include provisions that, at the option of the tenant, may obligate us to expend capital to expand an existing property or provide other expenditures for the benefit of the tenant.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 17 operating properties and three properties under development or redevelopment, of which 13 were wholly owned and seven were owned through joint ventures. These properties are located primarily in New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. and were approximately 97.1% leased as of December 31, 2019. Our period-over-period operating results are impacted by the real estate activities set forth in the \"Transaction Activity\" section of Item 1, Business, including acquisitions and dispositions made directly and through joint ventures. Other than real estate transactions, we expect real estate operating income to vary, primarily based on leasing activity over the near term.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues were $276.1 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $283.3 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($21.6 million) was partially offset by additional revenues from lease commencements ($13.1 million) and recent property acquisitions ($1.4 million). We expect future lease revenues to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee income was relatively stable at $7.5 million and $7.4 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect future asset and property management fee income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nOther property income was $5.1 million for 2019, and $7.3 million for 2018. The 2019 activity relates to administrative reimbursements. We expect other property income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nProperty operating costs were $93.3 million for 2019, which represents an increase from $88.8 million for 2018, primarily due to increases in property taxes and other taxes. We expect property operating costs to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee expenses were $0.6 million for 2019, which represents a decrease from $0.9 million for 2018, as a result of transitioning one of our properties from third-party to internal management. We expect asset and property management fee expenses to vary in the future based on investing activities.\nDepreciation was $78.3 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $81.8 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($6.3 million) was partially offset by capital projects across the portfolio ($2.2 million) and recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect depreciation to vary based on recent and future investing activities and capital projects.\nAmortization was $27.9 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $32.6 million for 2018, as a result of dispositions ($3.7 million) and lease terminations and extensions ($1.4 million), partially offset by recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect future amortization to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized the following impairment losses: $23.4 million in connection with changing the holding period expectations for Lindbergh Center; and $20.6 million in connection with exiting the Los Angeles market with the planned sale of Pasadena Corporate Park. For 2018, we recognized an impairment loss of $30.8 million in connection with changing our holding period expectations for 222 East 41st Street. We expect future impairment losses to depend primarily on our holding period intentions and any disposition strategies evaluated for our other properties.\nGeneral and administrative - corporate expenses were relatively stable at $32.8 million for 2019 and $33.0 million for 2018. We expect future general and administrative - corporate expenses to remain at similar or slightly increased levels as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses were $3.6 million for 2019, which represents an increase as compared with $3.1 million for 2018, primarily due to expanding our team. We expect future general and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses to vary as a result of future investing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized pre-acquisition costs of $6.4 million related to the Normandy transaction described in Note 16, Subsequent Events, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect to incur additional acquisition costs in connection with closing the transaction.\nInterest expense was $43.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $56.5 million for 2018. The decrease results from the settlement of a capital lease obligation using the corresponding development authority bonds in December 2018 ($6.9 million), prior-year debt repayments and settlements ($5.3 million), and interest capitalization ($1.2 million). We expect interest expense to vary in the near term based on future financing activities.\nWe recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $23.3 million for 2018. In April 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the related mortgage note, resulting in a $24.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt. In May 2018, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance on our bridge loan approximately six months early, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs; and in December 2018, we refinanced two of our debt facilities, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs.We expect future gains or losses on extinguishments of debt to vary with financing activities.\nInterest and other income was $0.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $6.9 million for 2018. The majority of this income was earned on investments in development authority bonds, which were used to settle a corresponding capital lease obligation in December 2018. Interest income earned on investments in development authority bonds was entirely offset by interest expense incurred on the corresponding capital leases. We expect interest income to remain at similar levels in the near term.\nWe recognized a gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests of $0.8 million for 2018, related to the sale of an additional 22.5% interest in University Circle and 333 Market Street joint ventures in February 2018, as further described in Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect future gains or losses on sales of unconsolidated joint venture interests to vary with future joint venture disposition activities.\nIncome from unconsolidated joint ventures was flat at $8.0 million for 2019 and 2018. We expect income from the unconsolidated joint ventures to vary based on future joint venture investing activities and leasing activity at the properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe recognized gains on sales of real estate assets of $42.0 million in 2019, as a result of selling One & Three Glenlake Parkway in April 2019. See Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. We expect future gains on sales of real estate assets to vary with disposition activity.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the allocation of earnings from the 101 Franklin Street joint venture to our joint venture partner.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of Columbia Property Trust was $9.2 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2019, which represents a slight decrease as compared with $9.5 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2018. The decrease is primarily due to prior-period gain on extinguishment of debt ($23.3 million) and year-over-year impairment activity ($13.1 million), partially offset by the current period gain on sale of One & Three Glenlake Parkway ($42.0 million). See \"Supplemental Performance Measures\" below for our same-store results compared with the prior year. We expect future earnings to vary primarily as a result of leasing activity at our existing properties and future investing activity.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor a comparison of our operations between 2018 and 2017, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Results of Operations\" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), as filed with the SEC on February 13, 2019.\nNOI by Geographic Segment\nWe consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. As of December 31, 2019, we aggregated our properties into the following geographic segments: New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and all other office markets. All other office markets consists of properties in low-barrier-to-entry geographic locations in which we do not have a substantial presence and/or do not plan to make further investments. See Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents NOI by geographic segment (in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. See also \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" preceding Part I.\nExecutive Summary\nOn January 24, 2020, we acquired Normandy, a vertically integrated real estate company focused in New York; Boston; and Washington, D.C., and general partnership interests in three active real estate funds, for approximately $100 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs. We believe that the acquisition of Normandy will further our strategic initiatives by strengthening our platform with additional development and redevelopment expertise, deal sourcing, other key capabilities, and by increasing our access to capital through Normandy's investor relationships.\nOur primary strategic objective is to generate long-term stockholder returns from a combination of growing cash flows and appreciation in the values of our properties. We own and operate high-quality office properties located in high-barrier-to-entry markets, primarily New York; San Francisco; Washington, D.C.; and Boston. Our approach is to own office buildings that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or that will be repositioned as such through value-add initiatives, including development or redevelopment. Our investment objectives include optimizing our portfolio allocation between stabilized investments and more growth-oriented, value-add investments and development projects with an emphasis on central business districts and multi-tenant buildings.\nOver the past several years, we have undertaken a capital recycling program that has involved selling more than 50 properties in geographically dispersed markets for aggregate proceeds of $4.4 billion, and reinvesting those proceeds in our core markets. In December 2019, we acquired for $205.5 million, 101 Franklin Street, a 16-story, 235,000-square-foot office building in Manhattan that will be fully redeveloped; and we acquired for $238.9 million, 201 California Street, a 17-story, 252,000-square-foot office tower in San Francisco that is 99% leased to 34 tenants. In January 2020, we sold Cranberry Woods Drive in Pittsburgh for a gross sale price of $180.0 million. We are continuing to pursue additional strategic investment opportunities in our target markets.\nOur portfolio is 97.1% leased, with less than 3% of our leases scheduled to expire in 2020. During 2019, we leased a total of 779,000 square feet of space, including a renewal lease with Pershing for 330,000 square feet at 95 Columbus in Jersey City. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 35.6%(1)(2); 91.5%(1) of our portfolio is unencumbered by mortgages; and our weighted average cost of borrowing during the quarter is 3.48%(1) per annum. Our debt maturities are laddered, coming due in two to seven years, and $784.0 million of our unsecured borrowings can be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. From time to time when we believe our stock is undervalued, we may take advantage of market opportunities by using our stock repurchase program to buy shares and return capital to our stockholders. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $20.72 per share, for aggregate purchases of $33.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, $166.5 million remains available under our current repurchase program.\n(1)Statistics include 100% of all of our consolidated properties and our ownership interest in the gross real estate assets and debt at properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures as described in Note 4, Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, of the accompanying financial statements.\n(2)On a net basis (i.e., reduced for cash on hand), our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is 34.8%.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur operating results depend primarily upon the level of income generated by the leases at our properties. Occupancy and rental rates are critical drivers of our lease income. Over the last year, our portfolio percentage leased ranged from 97.4% at December 31, 2018 to 97.1% at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth details related to the financial impact of our recent leasing activities for properties we consolidate and based on our proportionate share of properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of leases </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet of leasing - renewal </td> <td>547,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>505,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet of leasing - new </td> <td>175,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet of leasing </td> <td>722,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,072,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average lease term (months) </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement allowances, per square foot - renewal </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements allowances, per square foot - new </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements allowances, per square foot - all leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - renewal </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - new </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commissions, per square foot - all leases </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - renewal(1)\n</td> <td>59.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - new(1)\n</td> <td>61.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent leasing spread - all leases(1)\n</td> <td>59.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Rent leasing spreads are calculated based on the change in base rental income measured on a straight-line basis; and, for new leases, only include space that has been vacant for less than one year.\nIn 2019, rent leasing spreads were positive (59.9%), primarily related to a 333,000-square-foot office lease renewal with Pershing at 95 Columbus in Jersey City, a 46,000-square-foot renewal lease at 221 Main Street in San Francisco, a 31,000-square-foot renewal lease at 650 California Street in San Francisco, and a 29,500-square-foot lease renewal at 218 West 18th Street in New York City. In 2019, tenant improvements included $120.00 per square foot for the 31,000-square foot lease renewal at 650 California Street and $100.00 per square foot for a new 24,000-square-foot lease at 221 Main Street. In 2018, rent leasing spreads were positive (23.1%), primarily due to a lease extension with Twitter for 215,000 square feet at 249 West 17th Street and lease expansions for an aggregate of 199,000 square feet with Arby's Restaurant Group, a subsidiary of Inspire Brands, at One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta. In 2018, tenant improvement allowances include $115.00 per square foot for a new, 16.5-year lease with WeWork for 115,000 square feet at 149 Madison Avenue, which will entail a full-scale redevelopment of the property.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nCash flows generated from the operation of our properties are primarily used to fund recurring expenditures and stockholder dividends. The amount of distributions to common stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including funds deemed available for distribution based principally on our current and future projected operating cash flows, reduced by capital requirements necessary to maintain our existing portfolio, our future capital needs, and future sources of liquidity, as well as the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. Investments in new property acquisitions and first-generation capital improvements are generally funded with capital proceeds from property sales, debt, or cash on hand. Our board of directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2019 at a rate of $0.21 per share,\nwhich represents a $0.01 per share, or 5.0%, increase from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2020. The board of directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2020 at the same rate, $0.21 per share, which will be paid in March 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2020.\nShort-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2019, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of $137.4 million, which consists primarily of receipts from tenants for rent and reimbursements, reduced by payments for operating costs, administrative expenses, interest expense, and lease inducements. During the same period, we paid total distributions to stockholders of $93.5 million, which included dividend payments for four quarters ($23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and an aggregate of $70.2 million for the first three quarters of 2019).\nDuring 2019, we received $375.0 million in net sales proceeds from the sale of Lindbergh Center and One & Three Glenlake Parkway and had $152.0 million in net borrowings on our line of credit and term loans. These proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the acquisition of 201 California Street in San Francisco for $246.2 million; the acquisition of 101 Franklin Street in New York for $206.8 million; and leasing and capital projects, including those at our joint ventures, of $106.4 million.\nOver the short term, we expect our primary sources of capital and liquidity to be operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and debt. We expect that our principal demands for funds will be property acquisitions, capital improvements to our existing portfolio, stockholder distributions, stock repurchases, operating expenses, and interest and principal payments. As of February 3, 2020, we have access to $426.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current obligations as they come due.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOver the long term, we expect that our primary sources of capital will include operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and borrowing proceeds. We expect that our primary uses of capital will continue to include stockholder distributions; acquisitions; capital expenditures, such as building improvements, tenant improvements, and leasing costs; and repaying or refinancing debt.\nConsistent with our operational strategy and financing objectives, over the long term we have generally maintained debt levels at less than 40% of the undepreciated costs of our assets. As of December 31, 2019, our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio was approximately 35.6%. Our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio includes 100% of all consolidated assets and debt, and our proportional share of assets (including basis adjustments) and debt held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs described below, our variable-rate indebtedness may use London Interbank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is expected to be discontinued at the end of 2021. The anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which might increase the cost of our variable-interest debt instruments. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans or other financial arrangements. If LIBOR is discontinued as anticipated, or otherwise at our option, our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan facilities provide for alternate interest rate calculations.\nUnsecured Bank Debt\nOur Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $650.0 million and matures in January 2023, with two six-month extension options. As of December 31, 2019, we had $334.0 million in outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.45% for LIBOR borrowings, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.45% for base rate borrowings, based on our applicable credit rating. The per annum facility fee on the aggregate revolving commitment (used or unused) ranges from 0.125% to 0.30%, also based on our applicable credit rating. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility, along with the $300 Million Term Loan, as\ndescribed below, provides for four accordion options for an aggregate additional amount of up to $500 million, subject to certain limitations.\nOur $300.0 million unsecured term loan matures in January 2024 (the \"$300 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.65% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $300 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 2.55%.\nOur $150.0 million unsecured term loan matures in July 2022 (the \"$150 Million Term Loan\") and bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for base rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating. The interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 3.07%.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2019, the $300 Million Term Loan, the $150 Million Term Loan, and the Revolving Credit Facility contain the following restrictive covenants, which are defined in the debt agreements:\n\u2022limit the ratio of secured debt to total asset value to 40% or less;\n\u2022require the fixed charge coverage ratio to be at least 1.50:1.00;\n\u2022limit the ratio of debt to total asset value to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction;\n\u2022require the ratio of unencumbered interest coverage ratio to be at least 1.75:1.00;\n\u2022limit the unencumbered leverage ratio to 60% or less, or 65% or less following a material transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on these outstanding debt obligations.\nBonds Payable\nIn August 2016, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 3.650% senior notes at 99.626% of their face value (the \"2026 Bonds Payable\"). The 2026 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in February and August based on a contractual annual interest rate of 3.650%. The principal amount of the 2026 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, August 15, 2026.\nIn March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of 10-year, unsecured 4.150% senior notes at 99.859% of their face value (the \"2025 Bonds Payable\"). The 2025 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in April and October based on a contractual annual interest rate of 4.150%. The principal amount of the 2025 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, April 1, 2025.\nThe restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable as defined pursuant to an indenture include:\n\u2022a limitation on the ratio of debt to total assets, as defined, to 60%;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur debt if the consolidated income available for debt service to annual debt service charge, as defined, for four previous consecutive fiscal quarters is less than 1.50:1.00 on a pro forma basis;\n\u2022limits to our ability to incur liens if, on an aggregate basis for us, the secured debt amount would exceed 40% of the value of the total assets; and\n\u2022a requirement that the ratio of unencumbered asset value, as defined, to total unsecured debt be at least 150% at all times.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable.\nDebt Settlements and Interest Payments\nDuring 2019, we made interest payments of approximately $17.9 million related to our term loans, line of credit, and notes payable, and $27.3 million related to our bonds payable. There were no debt repayments in 2019. During 2018, we made the following debt repayments:\n\u2022On December 14, 2018, we terminated both the $120.0 million development authority bonds and the corresponding obligations under capital leases related to One & Three Glenlake Parkway in Atlanta.\n\u2022On December 7, 2018, concurrent with closing on the amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we repaid the $300 million remaining balance on the $300 Million Term Loan, which includes a delayed-draw feature, allowing up to 12 months to fully draw the term loan.\n\u2022On October 10, 2018, we paid the $20.7 million outstanding balance on the One Glenlake mortgage note two months prior to its original maturity date.\n\u2022On April 13, 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the $49.0 million loan principal, accrued interest expense, and accrued property operating expenses, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $24.0 million in the second quarter of 2018.\n\u2022On February 2, 2018, we repaid $120.0 million of the outstanding balance on a bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of a portion of University Circle and 333 Market Street. On May 30, 2018, we repaid the remaining $180.0 million outstanding balance on this bridge loan with disposition proceeds from the sale of 222 East 41st Street. The settlement of a $300 million bridge loan resulted in a $0.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt to write off the related unamortized deferred financing costs.\nContractual Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations will become payable in the following periods (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,706,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>799,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>700,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations on debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>266,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,988 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,170,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,137,230 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,143,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>880,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,863,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes our ownership share of the debt and interest obligations for the Market Square Joint Venture and the 799 Broadway Joint Venture, which we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. The Market Square Joint Venture has a $325.0 million mortgage loan on the Market Square Buildings, which bears interest at 5.07% and matures on July 1, 2023. We own a 51% interest in the Market Square Joint Venture. The 799 Broadway Joint Venture has $113.2 million outstanding on a construction loan, which has a total capacity of $187.0 million; bears interest at LIBOR, capped at 4.00%, plus 425 basis points; and matures on October 9, 2021. We own a 49.7% interest in the 799 Broadway Joint Venture. As of December 31, 2019, we guarantee equity contributions of $15.8 million to be made to the joint venture, under the 799 Broadway construction loan agreement (see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying financial statements).\n(2)Interest obligations on variable-rate debt are measured at the rate at which they are effectively fixed with interest rate swap agreements (where applicable) or the rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. Interest obligations on all other debt instruments are measured at the contractual rate. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for more information regarding our interest rate swaps.\n(3)These obligations are related to ground leases at certain properties, including 49.5% of the ground lease obligation at 114 Fifth Avenue, based on our ownership interest in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns that property, and our corporate office lease. In addition to the amounts shown, certain lease agreements include provisions that, at the option of the tenant, may obligate us to expend capital to expand an existing property or provide other expenditures for the benefit of the tenant.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 17 operating properties and three properties under development or redevelopment, of which 13 were wholly owned and seven were owned through joint ventures. These properties are located primarily in New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. and were approximately 97.1% leased as of December 31, 2019. Our period-over-period operating results are impacted by the real estate activities set forth in the \"Transaction Activity\" section of Item 1, Business, including acquisitions and dispositions made directly and through joint ventures. Other than real estate transactions, we expect real estate operating income to vary, primarily based on leasing activity over the near term.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues were $276.1 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $283.3 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($21.6 million) was partially offset by additional revenues from lease commencements ($13.1 million) and recent property acquisitions ($1.4 million). We expect future lease revenues to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee income was relatively stable at $7.5 million and $7.4 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect future asset and property management fee income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nOther property income was $5.1 million for 2019, and $7.3 million for 2018. The 2019 activity relates to administrative reimbursements. We expect other property income to increase as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nProperty operating costs were $93.3 million for 2019, which represents an increase from $88.8 million for 2018, primarily due to increases in property taxes and other taxes. We expect property operating costs to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nAsset and property management fee expenses were $0.6 million for 2019, which represents a decrease from $0.9 million for 2018, as a result of transitioning one of our properties from third-party to internal management. We expect asset and property management fee expenses to vary in the future based on investing activities.\nDepreciation was $78.3 million for 2019, which represents a modest decrease as compared with $81.8 million for 2018, as the impact of dispositions ($6.3 million) was partially offset by capital projects across the portfolio ($2.2 million) and recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect depreciation to vary based on recent and future investing activities and capital projects.\nAmortization was $27.9 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $32.6 million for 2018, as a result of dispositions ($3.7 million) and lease terminations and extensions ($1.4 million), partially offset by recent property acquisitions ($0.4 million). We expect future amortization to vary based on recent and future investing and leasing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized the following impairment losses: $23.4 million in connection with changing the holding period expectations for Lindbergh Center; and $20.6 million in connection with exiting the Los Angeles market with the planned sale of Pasadena Corporate Park. For 2018, we recognized an impairment loss of $30.8 million in connection with changing our holding period expectations for 222 East 41st Street. We expect future impairment losses to depend primarily on our holding period intentions and any disposition strategies evaluated for our other properties.\nGeneral and administrative - corporate expenses were relatively stable at $32.8 million for 2019 and $33.0 million for 2018. We expect future general and administrative - corporate expenses to remain at similar or slightly increased levels as a result of the Normandy Acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses were $3.6 million for 2019, which represents an increase as compared with $3.1 million for 2018, primarily due to expanding our team. We expect future general and administrative - unconsolidated joint ventures expenses to vary as a result of future investing activities.\nFor 2019, we recognized pre-acquisition costs of $6.4 million related to the Normandy transaction described in Note 16, Subsequent Events, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect to incur additional acquisition costs in connection with closing the transaction.\nInterest expense was $43.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $56.5 million for 2018. The decrease results from the settlement of a capital lease obligation using the corresponding development authority bonds in December 2018 ($6.9 million), prior-year debt repayments and settlements ($5.3 million), and interest capitalization ($1.2 million). We expect interest expense to vary in the near term based on future financing activities.\nWe recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $23.3 million for 2018. In April 2018, we transferred 263 Shuman Boulevard to the lender in extinguishment of the related mortgage note, resulting in a $24.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt. In May 2018, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance on our bridge loan approximately six months early, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs; and in December 2018, we refinanced two of our debt facilities, resulting in a $0.3 million loss due to the write-off of related deferred financing costs.We expect future gains or losses on extinguishments of debt to vary with financing activities.\nInterest and other income was $0.2 million for 2019, which represents a decrease as compared with $6.9 million for 2018. The majority of this income was earned on investments in development authority bonds, which were used to settle a corresponding capital lease obligation in December 2018. Interest income earned on investments in development authority bonds was entirely offset by interest expense incurred on the corresponding capital leases. We expect interest income to remain at similar levels in the near term.\nWe recognized a gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests of $0.8 million for 2018, related to the sale of an additional 22.5% interest in University Circle and 333 Market Street joint ventures in February 2018, as further described in Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We expect future gains or losses on sales of unconsolidated joint venture interests to vary with future joint venture disposition activities.\nIncome from unconsolidated joint ventures was flat at $8.0 million for 2019 and 2018. We expect income from the unconsolidated joint ventures to vary based on future joint venture investing activities and leasing activity at the properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe recognized gains on sales of real estate assets of $42.0 million in 2019, as a result of selling One & Three Glenlake Parkway in April 2019. See Note 3, Real Estate Transactions, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details. We expect future gains on sales of real estate assets to vary with disposition activity.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the allocation of earnings from the 101 Franklin Street joint venture to our joint venture partner.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of Columbia Property Trust was $9.2 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2019, which represents a slight decrease as compared with $9.5 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for 2018. The decrease is primarily due to prior-period gain on extinguishment of debt ($23.3 million) and year-over-year impairment activity ($13.1 million), partially offset by the current period gain on sale of One & Three Glenlake Parkway ($42.0 million). See \"Supplemental Performance Measures\" below for our same-store results compared with the prior year. We expect future earnings to vary primarily as a result of leasing activity at our existing properties and future investing activity.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor a comparison of our operations between 2018 and 2017, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Results of Operations\" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), as filed with the SEC on February 13, 2019.\nNOI by Geographic Segment\nWe consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. As of December 31, 2019, we aggregated our properties into the following geographic segments: New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and all other office markets. All other office markets consists of properties in low-barrier-to-entry geographic locations in which we do not have a substantial presence and/or do not plan to make further investments. See Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents NOI by geographic segment (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>San Francisco </td> <td>83,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Washington, D.C. </td> <td>33,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston </td> <td>7,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Los Angeles </td> <td>4,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other office markets </td> <td>35,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total office segments"}
