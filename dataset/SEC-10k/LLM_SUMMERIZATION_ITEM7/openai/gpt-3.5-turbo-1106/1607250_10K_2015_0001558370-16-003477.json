Item 1. Business,\u201d Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this annual report.\nBusiness\nOverview-Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean Partners\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, or our\u201d) is a growth-oriented limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd. (together with its affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean\u201d) to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. The drilling units in our fleet include the ultra-deepwater drillships Discoverer Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader and the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III, which are located in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) Gulf of Mexico. We generate revenues through contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and seconded work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.\nWe own a 51 percent interest in each of the entities that owns and operates the drilling units in our fleet (each individually, a RigCo\u201d, and collectively, the RigCos\u201d). Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the Transocean Member\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We control each RigCo through our ownership of the majority of its shares or limited liability company interests. We are entitled to only 51 percent of the RigCos' distributions, if any. Our interest in the RigCos represents our only cash-generating asset. We depend on Transocean affiliates to operate our drilling units, manage our customer relationships, renew existing and obtain new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative support activities. We anticipate growing by acquiring additional drilling rigs and operations indirectly through additional rig-owning and rig-operating entities and by acquiring additional equity interests in the RigCos.\nAlthough our contract drilling services operations are currently concentrated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we can provide our services anywhere in the global offshore drilling market. Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to fluctuate somewhat between regions. Still, significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility. Our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling services. The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate or upgrade our rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers.\nOur formation-On July 29, 2014, we entered into a contribution agreement with Transocean that gave effect to certain formation transactions, including Transocean's transfer of a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the RigCos. On July 31, 2014, our common units representing limited liability company interests began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RIGP.\u201d On August 5, 2014, we completed the formation transactions and our initial public offering of 20.1 million common units, which represented a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest. The Transocean Member holds the remaining 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units, which collectively represented a 70.8 percent limited liability company interest at the time of the initial public offering, and all of the incentive distribution rights (see -Significant Events-Unit repurchase program\u201d). As a result of the offering, the Transocean Member received net cash proceeds of $417 million, after deducting approximately $26 million for underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nThe Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the Predecessor\u201d) represents 100 percent of the combined results of operations, assets and liabilities of the drilling units in the fleet (the Predecessor Business\u201d) prior to completion of the formation transactions and initial public offering on August 5, 2014. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Presentation.\nSignificant Events\nUnit repurchase program-On November 4, 2015, we announced that our board of directors approved a unit repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units. Subject to market conditions, we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. As of February 16, 2016, under the unit repurchase program, we repurchased 306,967 of our publicly held common units at an average market price of $8.18 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nGoodwill impairment-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified indicators that the implied fair value of our goodwill could have fallen below its carrying amount. As a result, we performed interim goodwill impairment tests as of March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and determined that the remaining goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit was fully impaired. In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our impairment testing, we recognized an aggregate loss of $356 million, which had no tax effect, associated with the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill. See -Operating Results.\u201d\nWorking capital note payable-On July 29, 2014, we entered into agreements with a Transocean affiliate to establish a working capital note payable in the principal amount of $43 million that was due and payable at maturity on July 28, 2015. On July 17, 2015, we\n- 39 -\nmade a cash payment of $43 million to repay the borrowings outstanding under the working capital note payable. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to unitholders-On February 9, 2016, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. We expect to pay the aggregate cash distribution of $25 million on February 25, 2016 to unitholders of record as of February 22, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member. On February 9, May 4, July 30, and October 29, 2015, our board of directors approved distributions of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. On February 26, May 27, August 25, and November 23, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $100 million to our unitholders of record as of February 20, May 15, August 12, and November 9, 2015, including an aggregate cash distribution of $71 million to the Transocean Member. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to holder of noncontrolling interests-Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution of $54 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution $101 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nOutlook\nDrilling market-Although our long-term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high-specification assets, we expect the near to medium term to be especially challenging. The sustained weak commodity pricing, coupled with our customers' focus on reducing costs, spending within their cash flow and maintaining capital allocation policies is resulting in the delay of many exploration and development programs. Oil and natural gas prices do not currently support sustained demand for drilling rigs across all asset classes and regions. As a result of this reduced demand, we have seen a sharp decline in the execution of drilling contracts for the global offshore drilling fleet and an increase in the early termination of drilling contracts. We currently expect very few drilling contracts to be awarded in 2016, exacerbating the excess rig capacity and resulting in downward pressure on dayrates.\nFleet status-We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate. The uncommitted fleet rate is defined as the number of uncommitted days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is not committed to a shipyard.\nAs of February 11, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUncommitted fleet rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscoverer Inspiration\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscoverer Clear Leader\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment Driller III\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance and Other Key Indicators\nContract backlog-Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining in the firm contract period, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions. Contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the contractual operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our revenue efficiency measurement. To determine maximum revenues for purposes of calculating revenue efficiency, however, we include the revenues earned for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, other incentive provisions or cost escalation provisions, which are excluded from the amounts presented for contract backlog.

The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. In\n- 40 -\ncertain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time.

revenues-Contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $35 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration resulting from an increase in contractual dayrate and (b) approximately $24 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from improved revenue efficiency. These increases were partially offset by the following: (a) approximately $29 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from reduced revenue efficiency and (b) approximately $17 million of decreased revenues for all three rigs resulting from the recognition of pre-operating revenues.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $7 million of decreased operating and maintenance costs for all three rigs primarily resulting from reduced personnel costs and (b) approximately $6 million of decreased maintenance costs for Development Driller III. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $12 million of increased maintenance costs for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from pipe-handling equipment and subsea equipment inspections with no comparable costs in the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increased costs and expenses related to our operation as a separate publicly traded limited liability company for a full year.\nLoss on impairment-In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of interim impairment tests, we recognized a loss on the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our annual effective tax rates were 6.2 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes after excluding the loss on impairment. We treat the tax effect of settlements of prior-year tax liabilities and changes in prior-year tax estimates as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $1 million and net tax expense of less than $1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our effective tax rates were (12.4) percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes, including these discrete tax items.\n- 43 -\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results.

preventers and other subsea equipment and (b) approximately $8 million of increased revenues for all three rigs resulting from cost escalation provisions. Partially offsetting these increases was approximately $9 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader resulting from an out-of-service period associated with its five-year special periodic survey.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $6 million of increased costs due to blowout preventer recertification, (b) approximately $5 million of increased costs for all three rigs resulting from patent royalties paid as a percentage of revenues, and (c) approximately $5 million of increased costs for Development Driller III resulting from riser joint overhaul and certification. Partially offsetting these increases was the following: (a) approximately $6 million of decreased personnel costs and (b) approximately $4 million of decreased overhead allocations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to increased costs and expenses related to establishing a separate publicly traded limited liability company.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our annual effective tax rates were 8.5 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes.

Under the master services agreements with Transocean, Transocean provides its treasury services to manage our cash and cash equivalents. The Predecessor had no bank accounts, and Transocean did not allocate its cash and cash equivalents to the Predecessor. The Predecessor transferred the cash generated and used by its operations to Transocean, and Transocean funded the Predecessor's operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, the Predecessor's transfers of cash to and from Transocean's treasury were presented as net distributions to the Predecessor's parent on our consolidated statements of equity and in our financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(235) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(134) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in payments to affiliates for capital expenditures mostly offset by proceeds from affiliates for disposal of assets with no comparable cash flows in the prior year.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) distributions of available cash to unitholders and distributions to the holder of noncontrolling interests, (b) repayment of the working capital note payable to an affiliate with no comparable cash flows in the prior year and (c) proceeds from the working capital note payable with no comparable cash flows in the current year. These increases of cash used in financing activities were partially offset by distributions to the Predecessor parent with no comparable cash flows in the current year.\nSources and uses of liquidity\nOverview-We operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional drilling rigs and other capital expenditures, fund investments, including the equity portion of investments in drilling rigs, fund working capital, maintain cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows and pay distributions to our unitholders. We may also repurchase our common units under the unit repurchase program. We expect to fund our short-term liquidity needs through cash on hand, borrowings under credit facilities provided by Transocean affiliates or commercial banks, cash generated from operations and issuance of debt or equity securities.\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities provided by Transocean affiliates or commercial banks and issuances of debt and equity securities. Generally, our long-term sources of funds will be cash from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt and equity financings. Because we will distribute all of our available cash, after deducting estimated maintenance, net of replacement capital expenditures, we expect to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures for expansion by relying on external financing sources, including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nOur access to debt and equity markets may be limited due to a variety of events, including, among others, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry. Our ability to access such markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. An economic downturn could have an impact on Transocean, which is the lender in our revolving credit facility, or on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.\nWe intend to pay and we expect to have sufficient ability to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit per quarter, equivalent to $25 million per quarter, or approximately $100 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of outstanding common and subordinated units. At February 16, 2016, we had 41.1 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units outstanding. We do\n- 45 -\nnot have a legal obligation to pay this distribution, and the amount declared by our board of directors may vary from this minimum quarterly distribution depending on expectations for future transactions and activities in which we may engage.\nCash distributions to unitholders-On February 9, 2016, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. We expect to pay the aggregate cash distribution of $25 million on February 25, 2016 to unitholders of record as of February 22, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member.\nOn February 9, May 4, July 30 and October 29, 2015, our board of directors approved distributions of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. On February 26, May 27, August 25 and November 23, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $100 million to our unitholders of record as of February 20, May 15, August 12 and November 9, 2015, including an aggregate cash distribution of $71 million to the Transocean Member.\nOn November 4, 2014, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.2246 per unit to our unitholders based on the minimum quarterly distribution for the proportional period from the date of the closing of the initial public offering through September 30, 2014. On November 24, 2014, we made an aggregate cash payment of $15 million to our unitholders of record as of November 17, 2014, including an aggregate cash payment of $11 million to the Transocean Member.\nCash distributions to holder of noncontrolling interests-In January 2016, we paid an aggregate cash distribution of $54 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution of $101 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests.\nUnit repurchase program-On November 4, 2015, we announced that our board of directors approved a unit repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units. Subject to market conditions, we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. As of February 16, 2016, under the unit repurchase program, we repurchased 306,967 of our publicly held common units at an average market price of $8.18 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million.\nWorking capital note payable-On July 29, 2014, we entered into agreements with a Transocean affiliate to establish a working capital note payable in the principal amount of $43 million that was due and payable at maturity on July 28, 2015. On July 17, 2015, we made a cash payment of $43 million to repay in full the borrowings outstanding under the working capital note payable.\nRevolving credit facility-On August 5, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement, which is scheduled to expire on August 5, 2019, with a Transocean affiliate to establish a committed $300 million five-year revolving credit facility that allows for uncommitted increases in amounts agreed to by Transocean and us. We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus a margin (the revolving credit facility margin\u201d), which ranges from 1.625 percent to 2.250 percent based on our leverage ratio, as defined, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the revolving credit facility margin, less one percent per annum. Throughout the term of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment, which ranges from 0.225 percent to 0.325 percent based on our leverage ratio, as defined. Among other things, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility includes limitations on creating liens, incurring subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt ratio, as defined in the agreement, with certain adjustments during a specified acquisition period. Borrowings under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default. At February 16, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding and $300 million of available borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.\nLost revenues indemnification-Under the Omnibus Agreement, Transocean agreed to indemnify us for any lost revenues, up to $100 million, arising out of the failure to receive an operating dayrate from Chevron Corporaton (together with its affiliates, Chevron\u201d) for Discoverer Clear Leader, for the period commencing on the closing date of our initial public offering through the completion of the rig's 2014 special periodic survey. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we submitted to Transocean indemnification claims for an aggregate amount of $19 million, and in October 2014, we received payment of $9 million of such claims. In January 2015, we received payment of the remaining $10 million of the outstanding indemnification claims.\nEstimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures-Subject to the approval by the board of directors of each of the RigCos, each RigCo will transfer its available cash to its equityholders, including the Transocean Member, as holder of noncontrolling interests, each quarter. In determining the amount of cash available for transfer, the board of directors of each of the RigCos and our board of directors determine the amount of cash reserves to set aside, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters. Because of the substantial capital expenditures the RigCos are required to make to maintain their fleets, we estimate the average annual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures to be $69 million per year, including $50 million for long-term maintenance and society classification surveys and $19 million for replacing the rigs at the end of their useful lives.\nWe estimate $19 million per year for future rig replacement based on assumptions regarding the remaining useful life of the RigCos' rigs, a net investment rate applied on reserves, replacement values of the RigCos' rigs based on current market conditions, and the residual value of the rigs. The actual cost of replacing the rigs in the RigCos' fleet will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing market\n- 46 -\nconditions, drilling contract operating dayrates and the availability and cost of financing at the time of replacement. Our second amended and restated limited liability company agreement allows our board of directors to deduct from our operating surplus each quarter estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, as opposed to actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, in order to reduce disparities in operating surplus caused by fluctuating maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, such as society classification surveys and rig replacement. Our board of directors, with the approval of the conflicts committee, may determine that one or more of our assumptions should be revised, which could cause our board of directors to increase the amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures. We may elect to finance some or all of our maintenance and replacement capital expenditures through the issuance of additional equity securities, which could be dilutive to existing unitholders. As our fleet matures and expands, our long-term maintenance expenses will likely increase.\nContractual obligations-At December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations stated at face value, were as follows:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the years ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2015, our unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, net of prepayments, represented a liability of $3 million.

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5-Income Taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 47 -\nNon-GAAP measures\nWe present our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe certain financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provide management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, with supplemental information that can be used to assess the following: (a) our performance from period to period and against performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure, (b) the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our members, (c) our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and (d) the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense net of interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for losses on impairment, recognition of prior certification costs and license fees, recognition of non-cash royalty fees, recognition of the drilling contract intangible revenues and recognition of pre-operating revenues. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted for planned out-of-service operating and maintenance expense, cash proceeds from pre-operating revenues associated with our long-term receivables, estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, cash interest income and expense and cash income taxes.\nThe U.S. GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and the preparation of such measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to net income for each period presented:\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

2016, Transocean owned 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units, representing a 71.1 percent limited liability company interest in us, and all of our incentive distribution rights. Transocean also owns the non-economic interest in us that includes the right to appoint three of the seven members of our board of directors. Under our limited liability company agreement, common unitholders that own 50 percent or more of our common units have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors. Cumulative voting is an irrevocable election that allows for the unitholder to allocate its votes cumulatively, rather than proportionally. Therefore, for so long as Transocean owns 50 percent or more of our common units, it will have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors, which would enable Transocean to elect one or more of the elected directors even after it owns less than 50 percent of our common units. As a result, if cumulative voting was in effect, Transocean would have the ability to fill the majority of positions on our board, by appointment or election, as long as it retains at least 20 percent of our common units. The directors appointed by Transocean may designate a member of the board of directors to be the chairman of the board of directors. Specific rights of the Transocean Members are designated in our limited liability company agreement.\nWe, Transocean and certain of its affiliates entered into various agreements that gave effect to our formation, ongoing operational and administrative support and financing arrangements, which were not the result of arm's-length negotiations and they may not be on terms at least as favorable to the parties to these agreements as they could have obtained from unaffiliated parties. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 12-Related Party Transactions.\n- 49 -\nProcedures for review, approval and ratification of related person transactions-Our board of directors adopted a related party transactions policy that provides that our board of directors or its authorized committee will review all related person transactions that are required to be disclosed under SEC rules and, when appropriate, authorize or ratify all such transactions. In the event that our board of directors or its authorized committee considers ratification of a related person transaction and determines not to so ratify, the related party transactions policy provides that our management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul the transaction.\nThe related party transactions policy provides that, in determining whether or not to recommend the approval or ratification of a related person transaction, our board of directors or its authorized committee should consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available, including but not limited to:\nTable 277: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether there is an appropriate business justification for the transaction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe benefits that accrue to us as a result of the transaction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe terms available to unrelated third parties entering into similar transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe impact of the transaction on a director's independence, in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director or an immediate family member of a director is a partner, unitholder, member or executive officer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe availability of other sources for comparable products or services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether it is a single transaction or a series of ongoing, related transactions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether entering into the transaction would be consistent with the code of business conduct and ethics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOverview-We prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and contingent liabilities. These estimates require significant judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates, and we have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of such policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies.\nIncome taxes-We are organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and are resident in the United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) for taxation purposes. We are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our controlled affiliates are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized, conduct business or own assets. For this purpose, controlled affiliates include our rig-owning and rig-operating subsidiaries.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands-Because we and our controlled affiliates do not conduct business or operations in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, neither we nor our controlled affiliates are subject to income, capital gains, profits or other taxation under current Marshall Islands law. As a result, any distributions from our controlled affiliates are not subject to Marshall Islands taxation.\nUnited Kingdom-We and certain of our controlled affiliates are residents of the U.K. for taxation purposes. Any distributions from our controlled affiliates generally are exempt from taxation in the U.K. under the applicable exemption for distributions from subsidiaries. As a result, we do not expect to be subject to a material amount of taxation in the U.K. as a consequence of our U.K. residency for tax purposes.\nUnited States-We and our controlled affiliates are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we and our controlled affiliates are subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent we earn (i) certain types of income from U.S. sources or (ii) income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. and attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S. We do not expect to earn a material amount of such income. Certain of our controlled affiliates, however, conduct drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and are subject to taxation by the U.S. on their net income.\nCayman Islands-The Cayman Islands does not impose any income, capital gains, profits, withholding or other taxation on us, our controlled affiliates or on any distributions we or they may make.\nOur tax liability in any given year could be affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements, and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction. Although our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time, a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined.\nWe maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation, and the provisions and benefits resulting from changes to those liabilities are included in our annual tax provision along with related interest. Tax exposure items may include potential challenges to permanent establishment positions, intercompany pricing, disposition transactions, and withholding tax rates and their\n- 50 -\napplicability. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means, but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which could cause us to revise past estimates. A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our transfer pricing policies in certain countries could materially affect our tax liability in a given year.\nWe review our liabilities on an ongoing basis and, to the extent audits or other events cause us to adjust the liabilities accrued in prior periods, we recognize those adjustments in the period of the event. We do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the future impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our annual tax provision because changes to our tax liabilities are dependent on numerous factors that cannot be reasonably projected. These factors include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the taxes paid to one country that either produce, or fail to produce, offsetting tax changes in other countries.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially realized. When it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets, such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards, will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax assets that is considered to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets.\nTransocean has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities we or our subsidiaries may incur with respect to operations of the Predecessor. Transocean operated the assets of the Predecessor through its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Switzerland, and we have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which we operate and earn income. The Predecessor's annual tax provision was based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operated and earned income. The determination of the Predecessor's annual tax provision and evaluation of their tax positions involves interpretation of tax laws in the various jurisdictions and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Transocean is currently undergoing examinations in the U.S. for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying amount of our liability for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation was approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5-Income Taxes.\nProperty and equipment-The carrying amount of property and equipment is subject to various estimates, assumptions, and judgments related to capitalized costs, useful lives and salvage values and impairments. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying amount of our property and equipment was $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, representing 85 percent and 75 percent of our total assets, respectively.\nCapitalized costs-We capitalize costs incurred to enhance, improve and extend the useful lives of our property and equipment and expense costs incurred to repair and maintain the existing condition of our rigs. Capitalized costs increase the carrying amounts and depreciation expense of the related assets, which also impact our results of operations.\nUseful lives and salvage values-We depreciate our assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives after allowing for salvage values. We estimate useful lives and salvage values by applying judgments and assumptions that reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations, rig utilization and asset performance. Useful lives and salvage values of rigs are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors, including (a) technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas exploration and development, (b) changes in market or economic conditions, and (c) changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry. Applying different judgments and assumptions in establishing the useful lives and salvage values would likely result in materially different net carrying amounts and depreciation expense for our assets. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives and salvage values of the rigs, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. When evaluating the remaining useful lives of rigs, we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long-term impact of those upgrades on future marketability. At December 31, 2015, a hypothetical one-year increase in the useful lives of all of our rigs would cause a decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $2 million and a hypothetical one-year decrease would cause an increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $2 million.\nLong-lived asset impairment-We review the aggregate carrying amount of our long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, for potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the aggregate carrying amount of the drilling units and related equipment in our asset group may not be recoverable. We determine recoverability by evaluating the aggregate estimated undiscounted future net cash flows based on projected dayrates and utilization of our drilling units. When an impairment of our assets is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the aggregate carrying amount of the drilling units and related equipment in our asset group exceeds the aggregate estimated fair value. We measure the fair value of our drilling units and related equipment by applying a variety of valuation methods, incorporating a combination of income and market approaches, using projected discounted cash flows and estimates of the exchange price that would be received for the assets in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.\n- 51 -\nGoodwill impairment-Prior to the full impairment of our goodwill, we conducted impairment testing annually as of October 1 and more frequently, on an interim basis, when an event occurred or circumstances changed that indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit may have declined below its carrying amount. We tested goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. We determined that we have a single reporting unit for this purpose.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using a variety of valuation methods, incorporating both income and market approaches, including projected discounted cash flows, publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples. To develop the projected cash flows associated with our reporting unit, which are based on estimated future dayrates and rig utilization, we consider key factors that include assumptions regarding future commodity prices, credit market conditions and the effect these factors may have on our contract drilling operations and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers. We discount the projected cash flows using a long-term, risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which is based on our estimate of the investment returns that market participants would require for our reporting unit. We derive publicly traded company multiples for companies with operations similar to our reporting unit using observable information related to shares traded on stock exchanges and, when available, observable information related to recent acquisitions. If the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, we consider goodwill impaired and perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.\nBecause our business is cyclical in nature, the results of our impairment testing are expected to vary significantly depending on the timing of the assessment relative to the business cycle. Altering either the timing of or assumptions used in our reporting unit's fair value calculations could result in an estimate that is significantly below its carrying amount, which may indicate its goodwill is impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified indicators that the fair value of our reporting unit could have fallen below its carrying amount. Such impairment indicators included a reduction in the market value of our publicly traded common units, oil and natural gas prices as well as projected reductions in dayrates and utilization. As a result, we performed interim goodwill impairment tests as of March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and determined that the goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit was fully impaired. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an aggregate loss of $356 million, which had no tax effect, associated with the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill, of which $182 million was attributable to controlling interest and $174 million was attributable to noncontrolling interest.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3-New Accounting Pronouncements.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d). As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five years after the date of our initial public offering, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can, therefore, delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to take advantage of all of the applicable JOBS Act exemptions, including the exemption provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as described above. This election to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable. Accordingly, the information that we provide you may be different than what you may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.", "summary": "The MD&A report discusses the performance of Transocean Partners LLC, focusing on its business operations, formation, significant events, outlook, performance indicators, and financial results.

"item_7_text": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in Part I. Item 1. Business,\u201d Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this annual report.\nBusiness\nOverview-Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean Partners\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, or our\u201d) is a growth-oriented limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd. (together with its affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean\u201d) to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. The drilling units in our fleet include the ultra-deepwater drillships Discoverer Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader and the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III, which are located in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) Gulf of Mexico. We generate revenues through contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and seconded work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.\nWe own a 51 percent interest in each of the entities that owns and operates the drilling units in our fleet (each individually, a RigCo\u201d, and collectively, the RigCos\u201d). Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the Transocean Member\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We control each RigCo through our ownership of the majority of its shares or limited liability company interests. We are entitled to only 51 percent of the RigCos' distributions, if any. Our interest in the RigCos represents our only cash-generating asset. We depend on Transocean affiliates to operate our drilling units, manage our customer relationships, renew existing and obtain new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative support activities. We anticipate growing by acquiring additional drilling rigs and operations indirectly through additional rig-owning and rig-operating entities and by acquiring additional equity interests in the RigCos.\nAlthough our contract drilling services operations are currently concentrated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we can provide our services anywhere in the global offshore drilling market. Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to fluctuate somewhat between regions. Still, significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility. Our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling services. The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate or upgrade our rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers.\nOur formation-On July 29, 2014, we entered into a contribution agreement with Transocean that gave effect to certain formation transactions, including Transocean's transfer of a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the RigCos. On July 31, 2014, our common units representing limited liability company interests began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RIGP.\u201d On August 5, 2014, we completed the formation transactions and our initial public offering of 20.1 million common units, which represented a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest. The Transocean Member holds the remaining 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units, which collectively represented a 70.8 percent limited liability company interest at the time of the initial public offering, and all of the incentive distribution rights (see -Significant Events-Unit repurchase program\u201d). As a result of the offering, the Transocean Member received net cash proceeds of $417 million, after deducting approximately $26 million for underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nThe Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the Predecessor\u201d) represents 100 percent of the combined results of operations, assets and liabilities of the drilling units in the fleet (the Predecessor Business\u201d) prior to completion of the formation transactions and initial public offering on August 5, 2014. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Presentation.\nSignificant Events\nUnit repurchase program-On November 4, 2015, we announced that our board of directors approved a unit repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units. Subject to market conditions, we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. As of February 16, 2016, under the unit repurchase program, we repurchased 306,967 of our publicly held common units at an average market price of $8.18 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nGoodwill impairment-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified indicators that the implied fair value of our goodwill could have fallen below its carrying amount. As a result, we performed interim goodwill impairment tests as of March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and determined that the remaining goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit was fully impaired. In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our impairment testing, we recognized an aggregate loss of $356 million, which had no tax effect, associated with the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill. See -Operating Results.\u201d\nWorking capital note payable-On July 29, 2014, we entered into agreements with a Transocean affiliate to establish a working capital note payable in the principal amount of $43 million that was due and payable at maturity on July 28, 2015. On July 17, 2015, we\n- 39 -\nmade a cash payment of $43 million to repay the borrowings outstanding under the working capital note payable. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to unitholders-On February 9, 2016, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. We expect to pay the aggregate cash distribution of $25 million on February 25, 2016 to unitholders of record as of February 22, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member. On February 9, May 4, July 30, and October 29, 2015, our board of directors approved distributions of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. On February 26, May 27, August 25, and November 23, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $100 million to our unitholders of record as of February 20, May 15, August 12, and November 9, 2015, including an aggregate cash distribution of $71 million to the Transocean Member. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to holder of noncontrolling interests-Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution of $54 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution $101 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nOutlook\nDrilling market-Although our long-term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high-specification assets, we expect the near to medium term to be especially challenging. The sustained weak commodity pricing, coupled with our customers' focus on reducing costs, spending within their cash flow and maintaining capital allocation policies is resulting in the delay of many exploration and development programs. Oil and natural gas prices do not currently support sustained demand for drilling rigs across all asset classes and regions. As a result of this reduced demand, we have seen a sharp decline in the execution of drilling contracts for the global offshore drilling fleet and an increase in the early termination of drilling contracts. We currently expect very few drilling contracts to be awarded in 2016, exacerbating the excess rig capacity and resulting in downward pressure on dayrates.\nFleet status-We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate. The uncommitted fleet rate is defined as the number of uncommitted days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is not committed to a shipyard.\nAs of February 11, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n\nPerformance and Other Key Indicators\nContract backlog-Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining in the firm contract period, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions. Contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the contractual operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our revenue efficiency measurement. To determine maximum revenues for purposes of calculating revenue efficiency, however, we include the revenues earned for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, other incentive provisions or cost escalation provisions, which are excluded from the amounts presented for contract backlog. The contract backlog for our fleet was as follows:\n\nOur contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts. The contractual operating dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an alternative contractual dayrate, such as a waiting-on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances. The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. In\n- 40 -\ncertain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time. The actual dayrate we receive may be higher than the contractual rate under certain circumstances, such as when cost escalation provisions are applied.\nAverage contractual dayrate relative to our contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate to be earned per operating day in the measurement period. An operating day is defined as a day for which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of operations.\nAt February 11, 2016, the contract backlog for our fleet was as follows:\n\nAt February 11, 2016, our current contract terms, dayrates and customers were as follows:\n\nThe actual amounts of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will differ from the amounts and periods shown in the tables above due to various factors, including shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime and other factors that result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate. Additional factors that could affect the amount and timing of actual revenue to be recognized include customer liquidity issues and contract terminations.\nAverage daily revenue-Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day. An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of operations. The average daily revenue for our fleet was as follows:\n\nOur average daily revenue fluctuates primarily due to our revenue efficiency.\n- 41 -\nRevenue efficiency-Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the maximum revenue calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest amount of contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive provisions. The revenue efficiency rates for our fleet were as follows:\n\nOur revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances.\nRevenue efficiency decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to unpaid downtime for Discoverer Inspiration related to subsea and pipe-handling equipment. Correspondingly, revenue efficiency increased in the year ended December 31, 2015, relative to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to unplanned downtime in 2013 associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment.\nRig utilization-Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. The rig utilization rates for our fleet were as follows:\n\nOur rig utilization rate declines as a result of unplanned out-of-service shipyard periods. The rig utilization rate may also decline as a result of idle rigs and during shipyard and mobilization periods to the extent these rigs are not earning revenues.\n- 42 -\nOperating Results\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results. See -Performance and Other Key Indicators\u201d for definitions of operating days, average daily revenue, revenue efficiency and rig utilization.\n\nn/m\u201d means not meaningful.\nOperating revenues-Contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $35 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration resulting from an increase in contractual dayrate and (b) approximately $24 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from improved revenue efficiency. These increases were partially offset by the following: (a) approximately $29 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from reduced revenue efficiency and (b) approximately $17 million of decreased revenues for all three rigs resulting from the recognition of pre-operating revenues.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $7 million of decreased operating and maintenance costs for all three rigs primarily resulting from reduced personnel costs and (b) approximately $6 million of decreased maintenance costs for Development Driller III. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $12 million of increased maintenance costs for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from pipe-handling equipment and subsea equipment inspections with no comparable costs in the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increased costs and expenses related to our operation as a separate publicly traded limited liability company for a full year.\nLoss on impairment-In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of interim impairment tests, we recognized a loss on the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our annual effective tax rates were 6.2 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes after excluding the loss on impairment. We treat the tax effect of settlements of prior-year tax liabilities and changes in prior-year tax estimates as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $1 million and net tax expense of less than $1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our effective tax rates were (12.4) percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes, including these discrete tax items.\n- 43 -\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results. See -Performance and Other Key Indicators\u201d for definitions of operating days, average daily revenue, revenue efficiency and rig utilization.\n\nn/m\u201d means not meaningful.\nOperating revenues-Contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $41 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from higher revenue efficiency due to reduced downtime associated with blowout preventers and other subsea equipment and (b) approximately $8 million of increased revenues for all three rigs resulting from cost escalation provisions. Partially offsetting these increases was approximately $9 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader resulting from an out-of-service period associated with its five-year special periodic survey.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $6 million of increased costs due to blowout preventer recertification, (b) approximately $5 million of increased costs for all three rigs resulting from patent royalties paid as a percentage of revenues, and (c) approximately $5 million of increased costs for Development Driller III resulting from riser joint overhaul and certification. Partially offsetting these increases was the following: (a) approximately $6 million of decreased personnel costs and (b) approximately $4 million of decreased overhead allocations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to increased costs and expenses related to establishing a separate publicly traded limited liability company.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our annual effective tax rates were 8.5 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes. We treat the tax effect of settlements of prior-year tax liabilities and changes in prior-year tax estimates as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our effective tax rates were 8.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes, including these discrete tax items.\n- 44 -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and uses of cash\nTransocean uses a centralized approach to treasury services to perform cash management for the operations of its affiliates. Under the master services agreements with Transocean, Transocean provides its treasury services to manage our cash and cash equivalents. The Predecessor had no bank accounts, and Transocean did not allocate its cash and cash equivalents to the Predecessor. The Predecessor transferred the cash generated and used by its operations to Transocean, and Transocean funded the Predecessor's operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, the Predecessor's transfers of cash to and from Transocean's treasury were presented as net distributions to the Predecessor's parent on our consolidated statements of equity and in our financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in payments to affiliates for capital expenditures mostly offset by proceeds from affiliates for disposal of assets with no comparable cash flows in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in Part I. Item 1. Business,\u201d Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this annual report.\nBusiness\nOverview-Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean Partners\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, or our\u201d) is a growth-oriented limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd. (together with its affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise, Transocean\u201d) to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. The drilling units in our fleet include the ultra-deepwater drillships Discoverer Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader and the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III, which are located in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) Gulf of Mexico. We generate revenues through contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and seconded work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.\nWe own a 51 percent interest in each of the entities that owns and operates the drilling units in our fleet (each individually, a RigCo\u201d, and collectively, the RigCos\u201d). Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the Transocean Member\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We control each RigCo through our ownership of the majority of its shares or limited liability company interests. We are entitled to only 51 percent of the RigCos' distributions, if any. Our interest in the RigCos represents our only cash-generating asset. We depend on Transocean affiliates to operate our drilling units, manage our customer relationships, renew existing and obtain new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative support activities. We anticipate growing by acquiring additional drilling rigs and operations indirectly through additional rig-owning and rig-operating entities and by acquiring additional equity interests in the RigCos.\nAlthough our contract drilling services operations are currently concentrated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we can provide our services anywhere in the global offshore drilling market. Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to fluctuate somewhat between regions. Still, significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility. Our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling services. The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate or upgrade our rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers.\nOur formation-On July 29, 2014, we entered into a contribution agreement with Transocean that gave effect to certain formation transactions, including Transocean's transfer of a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the RigCos. On July 31, 2014, our common units representing limited liability company interests began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RIGP.\u201d On August 5, 2014, we completed the formation transactions and our initial public offering of 20.1 million common units, which represented a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest. The Transocean Member holds the remaining 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units, which collectively represented a 70.8 percent limited liability company interest at the time of the initial public offering, and all of the incentive distribution rights (see -Significant Events-Unit repurchase program\u201d). As a result of the offering, the Transocean Member received net cash proceeds of $417 million, after deducting approximately $26 million for underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nThe Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the Predecessor\u201d) represents 100 percent of the combined results of operations, assets and liabilities of the drilling units in the fleet (the Predecessor Business\u201d) prior to completion of the formation transactions and initial public offering on August 5, 2014. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Presentation.\nSignificant Events\nUnit repurchase program-On November 4, 2015, we announced that our board of directors approved a unit repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $40 million of our publicly held common units. Subject to market conditions, we may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. As of February 16, 2016, under the unit repurchase program, we repurchased 306,967 of our publicly held common units at an average market price of $8.18 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nGoodwill impairment-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified indicators that the implied fair value of our goodwill could have fallen below its carrying amount. As a result, we performed interim goodwill impairment tests as of March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and determined that the remaining goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit was fully impaired. In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our impairment testing, we recognized an aggregate loss of $356 million, which had no tax effect, associated with the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill. See -Operating Results.\u201d\nWorking capital note payable-On July 29, 2014, we entered into agreements with a Transocean affiliate to establish a working capital note payable in the principal amount of $43 million that was due and payable at maturity on July 28, 2015. On July 17, 2015, we\n- 39 -\nmade a cash payment of $43 million to repay the borrowings outstanding under the working capital note payable. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to unitholders-On February 9, 2016, our board of directors approved a distribution of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. We expect to pay the aggregate cash distribution of $25 million on February 25, 2016 to unitholders of record as of February 22, 2016, including an aggregate cash payment of $18 million to the Transocean Member. On February 9, May 4, July 30, and October 29, 2015, our board of directors approved distributions of $0.3625 per unit to our unitholders. On February 26, May 27, August 25, and November 23, 2015, we made an aggregate cash distribution of $100 million to our unitholders of record as of February 20, May 15, August 12, and November 9, 2015, including an aggregate cash distribution of $71 million to the Transocean Member. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCash distributions to holder of noncontrolling interests-Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution of $54 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate cash distribution $101 million to Transocean as holder of noncontrolling interests. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nOutlook\nDrilling market-Although our long-term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high-specification assets, we expect the near to medium term to be especially challenging. The sustained weak commodity pricing, coupled with our customers' focus on reducing costs, spending within their cash flow and maintaining capital allocation policies is resulting in the delay of many exploration and development programs. Oil and natural gas prices do not currently support sustained demand for drilling rigs across all asset classes and regions. As a result of this reduced demand, we have seen a sharp decline in the execution of drilling contracts for the global offshore drilling fleet and an increase in the early termination of drilling contracts. We currently expect very few drilling contracts to be awarded in 2016, exacerbating the excess rig capacity and resulting in downward pressure on dayrates.\nFleet status-We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate. The uncommitted fleet rate is defined as the number of uncommitted days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is not committed to a shipyard.\nAs of February 11, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUncommitted fleet rate\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscoverer Inspiration\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscoverer Clear Leader\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment Driller III\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance and Other Key Indicators\nContract backlog-Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining in the firm contract period, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions.

revenues-Contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $35 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Discoverer Inspiration resulting from an increase in contractual dayrate and (b) approximately $24 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from improved revenue efficiency. These increases were partially offset by the following: (a) approximately $29 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from reduced revenue efficiency and (b) approximately $17 million of decreased revenues for all three rigs resulting from the recognition of pre-operating revenues.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $7 million of decreased operating and maintenance costs for all three rigs primarily resulting from reduced personnel costs and (b) approximately $6 million of decreased maintenance costs for Development Driller III. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $12 million of increased maintenance costs for Discoverer Inspiration resulting from pipe-handling equipment and subsea equipment inspections with no comparable costs in the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increased costs and expenses related to our operation as a separate publicly traded limited liability company for a full year.\nLoss on impairment-In the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of interim impairment tests, we recognized a loss on the full impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our annual effective tax rates were 6.2 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes after excluding the loss on impairment. We treat the tax effect of settlements of prior-year tax liabilities and changes in prior-year tax estimates as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $1 million and net tax expense of less than $1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our effective tax rates were (12.4) percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, based on income (loss) before income taxes, including these discrete tax items.\n- 43 -\nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results.

means not meaningful.\nOperating revenues-Contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $41 million of increased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III resulting from higher revenue efficiency due to reduced downtime associated with blowout preventers and other subsea equipment and (b) approximately $8 million of increased revenues for all three rigs resulting from cost escalation provisions. Partially offsetting these increases was approximately $9 million of decreased revenues for Discoverer Clear Leader resulting from an out-of-service period associated with its five-year special periodic survey.\nCosts and expenses-Operating and maintenance costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $6 million of increased costs due to blowout preventer recertification, (b) approximately $5 million of increased costs for all three rigs resulting from patent royalties paid as a percentage of revenues, and (c) approximately $5 million of increased costs for Development Driller III resulting from riser joint overhaul and certification. Partially offsetting these increases was the following: (a) approximately $6 million of decreased personnel costs and (b) approximately $4 million of decreased overhead allocations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to increased costs and expenses related to establishing a separate publicly traded limited liability company.\nIncome tax expense-For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our annual effective tax rates were 8.5 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes. We treat the tax effect of settlements of prior-year tax liabilities and changes in prior-year tax estimates as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the effect of the discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our effective tax rates were 8.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes, including these discrete tax items.\n- 44 -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and uses of cash\nTransocean uses a centralized approach to treasury services to perform cash management for the operations of its affiliates. Under the master services agreements with Transocean, Transocean provides its treasury services to manage our cash and cash equivalents. The Predecessor had no bank accounts, and Transocean did not allocate its cash and cash equivalents to the Predecessor. The Predecessor transferred the cash generated and used by its operations to Transocean, and Transocean funded the Predecessor's operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, the Predecessor's transfers of cash to and from Transocean's treasury were presented as net distributions to the Predecessor's parent on our consolidated statements of equity and in our financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(235) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(101) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(134) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in payments to affiliates for capital expenditures mostly offset by proceeds from affiliates for disposal of assets with no comparable cash flows in"}
