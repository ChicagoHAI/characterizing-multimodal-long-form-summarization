Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, \"Selected Financial Data\" and Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Consolidated Financial Statements.\" In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2017, our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 719 full and select service hotels (182,913 rooms), including:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>305 managed properties (99,114 rooms), all of which we operate under management agreements with third-party property owners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>348 franchised properties (57,489 rooms), all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>31 owned properties (15,791 rooms) (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture), 1 capital leased property (171 rooms), and 7 operating leased properties (2,411 rooms), all of which we manage; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>23 managed properties and 4 franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures (7,937 rooms).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our worldwide property portfolio also included:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>3 destination wellness resorts (399 rooms), all of which we own and operate (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>6 all inclusive resorts (2,401 rooms), all of which are owned by a third party in which we hold common shares and which operates the resorts under franchise agreements with us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>16 vacation ownership properties, all of which are licensed by ILG under the Hyatt Residence Club brand and operated by third parties, including ILG and its affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>20 residential properties, which consist of branded residences and serviced apartments. We manage all of the serviced apartments and those branded residential units that participate in a rental program with an adjacent Hyatt-branded hotel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our worldwide property portfolio also included branded spas and fitness studios, comprised of leased and managed locations.\nWe believe our business model allows us to pursue more diversified revenue and income streams that balance both the advantages and risks associated with these lines of business. Our expertise and experience in each of these areas gives us the flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these lines of business. Growth in the number of management and franchise agreements and earnings therefrom typically results in higher overall returns on invested capital because the capital investment under a typical management or franchise agreement is not significant. The capital required to build and maintain hotels we manage or franchise for third-party owners is typically provided by the owner of the respective property with minimal capital required by us as the manager or franchisor. During periods of increasing demand, we do not share fully in the incremental profits of hotel operations for hotels we manage for third-party owners as our fee arrangements generally include a base amount calculated using the revenue from the subject hotel and an incentive fee that is, typically, a percentage of hotel profits that is usually less than 20%, with certain financial thresholds to be satisfied, with the actual level depending on the structure and terms of the management agreement. We do not share in the benefits of increases in profits from franchised properties because franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees that are calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, and also at times as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, with no fees based on profits. Disputes or disruptions may arise with third-party owners of hotels we manage, franchise, or license and these disputes can result in termination of the relevant agreement.\nWith respect to property ownership, we believe ownership of selected hotels in key markets enhances our ability to control our brand presence in these markets. Ownership of hotels allows us to capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand and room rates. The cost structure of a typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and room rates increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. Hotel ownership is, however, more capital intensive than managing hotels for third-party owners, as we are responsible for the costs and all capital expenditures for our owned hotels. The profits realized from our owned and leased hotels are generally more significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues than the results of our managed and franchised properties. This is because we absorb the full impact of declining profits for our owned and leased hotels whereas our management and franchise fees do not have the same level of downside exposure to declining hotel profitability. See also \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Expenses-Factors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses-Fixed nature of expenses.\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions, or restrict our growth strategy.\"\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 80.5%, 80.6%, and 80.7% of our revenues were derived from operations in the United States, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 76.9% and 78.4% of our long-lived assets were located in the United States, respectively.\nWe report our consolidated operations in U.S. dollars. Amounts are reported in millions, unless otherwise noted. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding and percentage changes that are not meaningful are presented as \"NM\". Constant currency disclosures throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are non-GAAP measures. See \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management-Constant dollar currency\" below for further discussion of constant currency disclosures. We manage our business within four reportable segments, see Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nKey Business Metrics Evaluated by Management\nRevenues\nWe primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management and franchise fees, other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and other revenues. Management uses revenues to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends such as consumer demand, brand preference, and competition. For a detailed discussion of the factors that affect our revenues, see \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Revenues.\"\nNet Income Attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation\nNet income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation represents the total earnings or profits generated by our business. Management uses net income to analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and EBITDA\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA throughout this annual report. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as we define them, are non-GAAP measures (as defined below). We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>provision for income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>gains (losses) on sales of real estate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>asset impairments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other income (loss), net.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. See \"-Results of Operations.\"\nOur board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA, or some combination of both.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making compensation decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management addresses these limitations by reference to our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. See our consolidated statements of income in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nFor a reconciliation of net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation to EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, see \"-Results of Operations.\"\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis since it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations, both on a segment and consolidated basis. See \"-Results of Operations\" for a reconciliation of selling, general, and administrative expenses to Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nConstant Dollar Currency\nWe report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period's exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results.\nRevenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\nRevPAR is the product of ADR and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry.\nRevPAR changes driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food\nand beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs.\nAverage Daily Rate\nADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotels' available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.\nComparable Hotels\n\"Comparable systemwide hotels\" represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the EAME/SW Asia management and franchising segment. \"Comparable operated hotels\" is defined the same as \"comparable systemwide hotels\" with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise. \"Comparable owned and leased hotels\" represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry. \"Non-comparable systemwide hotels\" or \"Non-comparable owned and leased hotels\" represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of \"comparable\" as defined above.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nPrincipal Components\nWe primarily derive our revenues from the following sources:\nRevenues from hotel operations. Represents revenues derived from hotel operations, including room rentals and food and beverage sales, and other ancillary revenues at our owned and leased properties. Revenues from the majority of our hotel operations depend heavily on demand from group and transient travelers, as discussed below. Revenues from our owned and leased hotels are primarily derived from hotel operations.\nRevenues from room rentals and ancillary revenues are primarily derived from three categories of customers: transient, group, and contract. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve a minimum of 10 rooms for meetings or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious, or other organizations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services, such as catering and banquet services. Our contract guests are traveling under a contract negotiated for a block of rooms for more than 30 days in duration at agreed-upon rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels.\nManagement and franchise fees. Represents revenues derived from fees earned from hotels and residential properties managed worldwide (usually under long-term management agreements), franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands (usually under long-term franchise agreements), termination fees, the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement, and license fees received in connection with\nvacation ownership properties. For a detailed discussion of our management and franchise fees, see Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Management Agreements-Fees\" and Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Franchise Agreements-Fees.\"\nOther revenues. Represents revenues primarily related to our co-branded credit card and exhale.\nOther revenues from managed and franchised properties. Represents revenues related primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties that are fully reimbursed by the third-party property owner based on the costs incurred, with no added margin. As a result, these revenues have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total revenues and the corresponding costs increase our total expenses. We record these revenues in \"Other revenues from managed and franchised properties\" and the corresponding costs in \"Other costs from managed and franchised properties\" in our consolidated statements of income.\nIntersegment eliminations. We evaluate our reportable segments with intersegment revenues and expenses included in their results. These intersegment revenues and expenses represent management fee revenues and expenses related to our owned and leased hotels and promotional award redemption revenues and expenses related to our co-branded credit card at our owned and leased hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation.\nFactors Affecting Our Revenues\nFor other factors affecting our revenues, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nConsumer demand and global economic conditions. Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, risks related to natural or man-made disasters, lower consumer confidence, adverse political conditions, currency volatility, impacts of terrorism, and declining oil prices can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned hotel operations and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. Also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees, since it is based on hotel profit measures. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Hospitality Industry.\"\nRevPAR Statistics Table 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Comparable locations)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RevPAR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of comparable hotels (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change (in constant $)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide hotels\n</td> <td>589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owned and leased hotels\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas full service hotels\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas select service hotels\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ASPAC full service hotels\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EAME/SW Asia full service hotels\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EAME/SW Asia select service hotels\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Comparable systemwide hotels include one select service hotel in ASPAC, which is not included in the ASPAC full service hotel statistics. The number of comparable hotels presented above includes owned and leased hotels.\nSystemwide RevPAR increased 3.3% during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by improved transient ADR and demand across each of our segments as well as increased group ADR and demand in the Americas and ASPAC. RevPAR related to owned and leased hotels increased due to increases in transient demand in the United States and Europe. Group ADR growth at our full service hotels resulted in increased group revenue despite lower group demand during 2017 compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in 2017 was lower compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in future years increased compared to 2016 driven by strong fourth quarter production. See \"- Segment Results\" for discussion of RevPAR by segment.\nCompetition. The global lodging industry is highly competitive. While lodging demand has continued to grow over the last several years, we have also seen an increase in supply, particularly in certain key markets. This increased supply can put\nsignificant pressure on ADR levels at our properties as well as those of our competitors. Despite this increased supply, our systemwide RevPAR levels have increased each year since 2009. We also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, including online travel services and peer-to-peer inventory sources, as well as industry consolidation. We believe our brand strength and ability to manage our operations in an efficient manner will help us to continue competing successfully within the global hospitality industry.\nAgreements with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. We depend on our long-term management and franchise agreements with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchising fee revenues. The success and sustainability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchising agreements and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. Our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. We believe we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees, and developers in all of our segments and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees, and developers and are not heavily concentrated with any particular third party.\nAccess to capital. The hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant amounts of capital expenditures to develop, maintain, and renovate properties. Third-party owners are required to fund these capital expenditures for the properties they own in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or franchise agreement. Access to the capital that we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues. The availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues.\nExpenses\nPrincipal Components\nWe primarily incur the following expenses:\nOwned and leased hotels expenses. Owned and leased hotels expenses reflect the expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Expenses to operate our hotels include room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs, and property expenses. Room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry, and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. Food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. Other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management (including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts), utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment, and services. Property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent, and insurance.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of management and franchise agreement intangibles and lease related intangibles.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense, including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts, for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including regional offices that support our management and franchising segments), professional fees (including consulting, audit, and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, sales and marketing expenses, bad debt expenses, and office administrative and related expenses.\nOther costs from managed and franchised properties. Represents costs related primarily to payroll expenses at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties. These costs are reimbursed to us with no added margin. As a result, these costs have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total expenses and the corresponding reimbursements increase our total revenues.\nFactors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses\nFor other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nFixed nature of expenses. Many of the expenses associated with developing, owning, operating, managing, franchising, and licensing hotels and other properties, including branded spas and fitness studios, and residential and vacation ownership\nproperties, are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins, and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotels segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the fixed-cost nature of our business. As a result, we may not always be able to offset reductions in revenue through cost cutting. Employees at some of our owned hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our properties and brands. We intend to manage our cost structure at levels appropriate for the degree of demand and revenue generated at our hotels.\nChanges in depreciation expenses. Changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing properties, acquisition or development of new properties, or the disposition of existing properties through sale or closure. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in businesses, properties, or other assets. If we consummate such acquisitions in businesses, properties, or other assets, we would likely add depreciable assets, which would result in an increase in depreciation expenses.\nOther Items\nAsset impairments\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments. We evaluate these assets on a quarterly basis for impairment as further discussed in \"-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\" These evaluations have, in the past, resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets. We may be required to take additional impairment charges to reflect further declines in our asset and/or investment values.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, and significant renovations\nWe routinely acquire, divest, or undertake large scale renovations of hotel properties. The results of operations derived from these properties do not, therefore, meet the definition of \"comparable hotels\" as defined in \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management.\" The results of operations from these properties, however, may have a material effect on our results from period to period and are, therefore, addressed separately in our discussion on results of operations when material.\nIn 2017, we entered into the following key transactions:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa as a portfolio for a net sales price of $296 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser for each property;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sold Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress for a net sales price of $202 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sold Hyatt Regency Louisville for a net sales price of $65 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sold Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course for a net sales price of $58 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquired Miraval, the renowned provider of wellness and mindfulness experiences, for $237 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In 2016, we entered into the following key transactions:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquired Thompson Miami Beach for a purchase price of approximately $238 million.

Additionally, franchise fees increased $11 million and base and incentive fees increased $6 million and $2 million, respectively, primarily due to new hotels and improved performance across the region.\nThe increase in other revenues from managed and franchised properties for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due to increased reimbursements for payroll and related costs, technology costs, and redemptions related to the loyalty program.

The decrease in management, franchise, and other fees was primarily due to a $2 million decrease in incentive fees, driven primarily by decreased performance at properties in Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by increases at properties in India and ramping of hotels opened in 2015.\nThe increase in other revenues from managed and franchised properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a higher volume of reimbursements for reservation and technology costs as well as increased redemptions related to the loyalty program.\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Comparable Systemwide Hotels)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ADR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Better /\n(Worse)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Better / (Worse) Constant $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nOcc % pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Better /\n(Worse)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Better / (Worse) Constant $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EAME/SW Asia full service\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EAME/SW Asia select service\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding the net unfavorable currency impact, the decrease in comparable full service RevPAR during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven primarily by decreased ADR and occupancy in France, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Middle East.

Resources\nOverview\nWe finance our business primarily with existing cash, short-term investments, and cash generated from our operations. As part of our business strategy, we also recycle capital by using net proceeds from dispositions to support our acquisitions and new investment opportunities. When appropriate, we borrow cash under our revolving credit facility or from other third-party sources and may also raise funds by issuing debt or equity securities as necessary. We maintain a cash investment policy that emphasizes preservation of capital. We believe our cash position, short-term investments, and cash from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our access to the capital markets, will be adequate to meet all of our funding requirements and capital deployment objectives for the foreseeable future.\nWe may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity and/or debt securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nRecent Transactions Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015 several transactions impacted our liquidity.

We classify our capital expenditures into maintenance, enhancements to existing properties, and investment in new properties under development or recently opened.

The decrease in investment in new properties under development or recently owned from 2016 to 2017 is due to the opening of a property that was previously under construction and the sale of an owned property under development to an unconsolidated hospitality venture. The decreases were partially offset by renovation spend in 2017 at our Miraval properties.\nThe decrease in maintenance and technology expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 is driven by decreased technology spending and decreased spending at domestic full service properties. The increase in enhancements to existing properties is driven by increased renovation activity at domestic and international full service properties and expenditures related to our new corporate office. Expenditures related to new properties under development are driven primarily by construction spending related to Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro, which opened in early 2016, and two new select service hotels under development in the United States.\nSenior Notes\nThe table below sets forth the outstanding principal balance of our Senior Notes at December 31, 2017, as defined in Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\".

We may also redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption plus a make-whole amount.\nWe are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Notes at December 31, 2017.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn January 6, 2014, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders that amended and restated our prior revolving credit facility to extend the facility's expiration from September 9, 2016 to January 4, 2019. The revolving credit facility is intended to provide financing for working capital and general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back-up and permitted investments and acquisitions.\nWe had no outstanding undrawn letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility (which would reduce the availability thereunder) at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we had available borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion under our revolving credit facility, as there was no outstanding revolver balance.\nAll of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the revolving credit facility. All guarantees are guarantees of payment and performance and not of collection. Hotel Investors I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is an additional borrower under our revolving credit facility.\nInterest rates on outstanding borrowings are either LIBOR-based or based on an alternate base rate, with margins in each case based on our credit rating or, in certain circumstances, our credit rating and leverage ratio. At December 31, 2017, the interest rate for a one month LIBOR borrowing under our revolving credit facility would have been 2.664%, or LIBOR of 1.564% plus 1.100%.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at either one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.900% to 1.500% per annum (plus any mandatory costs, if applicable) or the alternative base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.500% per annum, in each case depending on our credit rating by either S&P or Moody's or, in certain circumstances, our credit rating and leverage ratio. Borrowings under our swingline subfacility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the alternate base rate plus the applicable percentage for revolving loans that are alternate base rate loans. We are also required to pay letter of credit fees with respect to each letter of credit equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR on the face amount of each letter of credit. In addition, we must pay a fronting fee to the issuer of each letter of credit of 0.10% per annum on the face amount of such letter of credit.\nThe revolving credit facility also provides for a facility fee ranging from 0.100% to 0.250% of the total commitment of the lenders under the revolving credit facility (depending on our credit rating by either S&P or Moody's). The facility fee is charged regardless of the level of borrowings.\nIn the event we no longer have a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's or our rating falls at or below BBB-/Baa3, with respect to borrowings under our revolving credit facility (a) such borrowings will bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1.300% or 1.500% per annum or the alternative base rate referenced above plus 0.300% or 0.500% per annum, in each case, depending on our leverage ratio and (b) the facility fee will be 0.200% or 0.250%.\nOur revolving credit facility contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants including limitations on the ability to place liens on our or our direct or indirect subsidiaries' assets; to merge, consolidate, and dissolve; to sell assets; to engage in transactions with affiliates; to change our or our direct or indirect subsidiaries' fiscal year or organizational documents; and to make restricted payments.\nOur revolving credit facility also requires us to meet Leverage Ratio and Secured Funded Debt Ratio financial covenants in each case measured quarterly as defined in our revolving credit facility.\nThe revolving credit facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that limit our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the revolving credit facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1, and limit our Secured Funded Debt Ratio (consisting of the ratio of Secured Funded Debt to Property and Equipment, each as defined in the revolving credit facility), to not more than 0.30 to 1. Our outstanding Senior Notes do not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy all the covenants in our revolving credit facility and Senior Notes, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels, or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.\nIn January 2018, we refinanced our revolving credit facility. See Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nLetters of Credit\nWe issue letters of credit either under the revolving credit facility or directly with financial institutions. We had $309 million and $230 million in letters of credit issued directly with financial institutions outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These letters of credit had weighted average fees of 93 basis points and a range of maturity of up to three years at December 31, 2017.\nOther Indebtedness and Future Debt Maturities\nExcluding the $1,196 million of Senior Notes, all other third-party indebtedness at December 31, 2017 was $255 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, $11 million of our outstanding debt will mature in the following 12 months.

These amounts are discussed in \"-Sources and Uses of Cash-Revolving Credit Facility and -Letters of Credit\", \"-Contractual Obligations\" and Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nA number of our accounting policies, which are described in Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" are critical due to the fact they involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. Those accounting policies and other critical estimates are included below. As a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. While we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period. In addition, changes in the accounting estimates that we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.\nGuarantees\nWe enter into performance guarantees related to certain hotels we manage. We also enter into debt repayment and other guarantees with respect to our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, certain managed or franchised hotels, and other properties. Upon inception of the guarantee, we record a stand ready to perform liability that is measured at fair value. In order to estimate fair value, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of possible outcomes. We are required to make certain assumptions and judgments in our determination of the fair value, which are based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, market conditions, location of the property, and specific information available at the time of the valuation.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using balances at October 1 and at an interim date, if indications of impairment exist. The Company has eight reporting units which have goodwill at December 31, 2017.\nWe are required to apply judgment when determining whether or not indications of impairment exist. The determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the property or properties, market conditions, and specific information available at the time of the assessment. We realize, however, that the results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. Judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates use when calculating the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible.\nHistorically, changes in estimates used in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment valuations have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes in those estimates. However, changes in\nthe economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings. At December 31, 2017, a change in our assumptions and estimates that could reduce the fair value of each of our reporting units or indefinite-lived brand intangibles by 10% would not result in an impairment. In periods which are close to an acquisition, we would expect fair value to approximate carrying value and do not consider this to be indicative of an impairment risk, absent other factors.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. We use judgment to determine the fair value of the property or business acquired and to determine the amount of value to allocate to each identifiable asset or liability. Typically, tangible assets acquired include property and equipment, and intangible assets acquired may include a management agreement intangible, a brand intangible, advanced bookings, and goodwill. Changes to the significant assumptions or factors used to determine fair value could affect the measurement and allocation of fair value.\nProperty and Equipment and Definite-Lived Intangibles\nWe evaluate property and equipment and definite-lived intangibles for impairment quarterly. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist. The determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time of the assessment. We realize, however, that the results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When a triggering event occurs, judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group, if applicable.\nChanges in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived assets in future periods, which could be material to our earnings. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangibles impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those estimates.\nAvailable For Sale (\"AFS\") Debt Securities\nSee Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for our assessment process and further information regarding our estimates used in determining the fair value of AFS debt securities.\nUnconsolidated Hospitality Ventures\nWe assess investments in unconsolidated hospitality ventures for impairment quarterly. We use judgment to determine whether or not there is an indication that a loss in value has occurred and whether a decline is deemed to be other than temporary. The determination of whether a loss in value has occurred is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the underlying venture property, market conditions, and venture-specific information available at the time of the assessment. When there is an indication that a loss in value has occurred, judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates to use when calculating the fair value.\nChanges in economic and operating conditions impacting these estimates and judgments could result in impairments to our investments in unconsolidated hospitality ventures in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the unconsolidated hospitality ventures impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, we recorded an estimated tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017 in relation to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and the additional tax expense associated with the deemed repatriation tax. Additionally, we recorded a valuation allowance against foreign tax credits which we anticipate will no longer be realizable based upon the taxation of foreign earnings under the new tax legislation.\nThe impact of the new U.S. tax legislation has been recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") 118. In accordance with SAB 118, we are required to recognize the income tax effects of those aspects of the new legislation for which the accounting is complete. To the extent our accounting for certain income tax effects of the new legislation is incomplete, but we are able to determine a reasonable estimate, we must record a provisional estimate in our consolidated financial statements. If we cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in our consolidated financial statements, we should continue to apply our accounting treatment on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the new legislation. The provisional expenses as they relate to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets, deemed repatriation tax, and valuation allowance against foreign tax credits recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 may be subject to adjustments in subsequent periods throughout 2018 as a result of potential amendments, technical corrections, and further interpretation and implementation of the new legislation.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return to determine whether they are \"more likely than not\" of being sustained assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements. If the position drops below the \"more likely than not\" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the \"more likely than not\" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the \"more likely than not\" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nFor information regarding the impact of the newly enacted tax legislation and the provisional estimates recorded for 2017, see Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nInsurance\nOur insurance reserves are accrued based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that occurred during the covered period, which includes claims incurred but not reported, for which we will be responsible. These estimates are prepared with the assistance of outside actuaries and consultants. Actual cost of claims may differ from our original estimates and could result in a material change to our liability.\nLoyalty Program Future Redemption Obligation\nWe utilize an actuary to assist with our estimate of our future redemption obligation related to the World of Hyatt loyalty program. Changes in the estimates used in the determination of the future redemption obligation, including the estimated cost per point and the estimate of the \"breakage\" for points that will never be redeemed, could result in a material change to our future redemption obligation.\nAt December 31, 2017, the redemption liability related to the loyalty program was $469 million. A 10% decrease in the breakage assumption would have resulted in an increase in the redemption liability of approximately $45 million at December 31, 2017.\nFuture Adoption of Accounting Standards\nSee Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for the Company's current evaluation of the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (\"ASU 2014-09\"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and other accounting standards effective in future periods.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of the company, emphasizing the forward-looking statements and associated risks.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, \"Selected Financial Data\" and Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Consolidated Financial Statements.\" In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2017, our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 719 full and select service hotels (182,913 rooms), including:\n \u2022 305 managed properties (99,114 rooms), all of which we operate under management agreements with third-party property owners; \n \u2022 348 franchised properties (57,489 rooms), all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties; \n \u2022 31 owned properties (15,791 rooms) (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture), 1 capital leased property (171 rooms), and 7 operating leased properties (2,411 rooms), all of which we manage; and \n \u2022 23 managed properties and 4 franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures (7,937 rooms).  Our worldwide property portfolio also included:\n \u2022 3 destination wellness resorts (399 rooms), all of which we own and operate (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture); \n \u2022 6 all inclusive resorts (2,401 rooms), all of which are owned by a third party in which we hold common shares and which operates the resorts under franchise agreements with us; \n \u2022 16 vacation ownership properties, all of which are licensed by ILG under the Hyatt Residence Club brand and operated by third parties, including ILG and its affiliates; and \n \u2022 20 residential properties, which consist of branded residences and serviced apartments. We manage all of the serviced apartments and those branded residential units that participate in a rental program with an adjacent Hyatt-branded hotel.  Our worldwide property portfolio also included branded spas and fitness studios, comprised of leased and managed locations.\nWe believe our business model allows us to pursue more diversified revenue and income streams that balance both the advantages and risks associated with these lines of business. Our expertise and experience in each of these areas gives us the flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these lines of business. Growth in the number of management and franchise agreements and earnings therefrom typically results in higher overall returns on invested capital because the capital investment under a typical management or franchise agreement is not significant. The capital required to build and maintain hotels we manage or franchise for third-party owners is typically provided by the owner of the respective property with minimal capital required by us as the manager or franchisor. During periods of increasing demand, we do not share fully in the incremental profits of hotel operations for hotels we manage for third-party owners as our fee arrangements generally include a base amount calculated using the revenue from the subject hotel and an incentive fee that is, typically, a percentage of hotel profits that is usually less than 20%, with certain financial thresholds to be satisfied, with the actual level depending on the structure and terms of the management agreement. We do not share in the benefits of increases in profits from franchised properties because franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees that are calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, and also at times as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, with no fees based on profits. Disputes or disruptions may arise with third-party owners of hotels we manage, franchise, or license and these disputes can result in termination of the relevant agreement.\nWith respect to property ownership, we believe ownership of selected hotels in key markets enhances our ability to control our brand presence in these markets. Ownership of hotels allows us to capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand and room rates. The cost structure of a typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and room rates increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. Hotel ownership is, however, more capital intensive than managing hotels for third-party owners, as we are responsible for the costs and all capital expenditures for our owned hotels. The profits realized from our owned and leased hotels are generally more significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues than the results of our managed and franchised properties. This is because we absorb the full impact of declining profits for our owned and leased hotels whereas our management and franchise fees do not have the same level of downside exposure to declining hotel profitability. See also \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Expenses-Factors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses-Fixed nature of expenses.\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions, or restrict our growth strategy.\"\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 80.5%, 80.6%, and 80.7% of our revenues were derived from operations in the United States, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 76.9% and 78.4% of our long-lived assets were located in the United States, respectively.\nWe report our consolidated operations in U.S. dollars. Amounts are reported in millions, unless otherwise noted. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding and percentage changes that are not meaningful are presented as \"NM\". Constant currency disclosures throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are non-GAAP measures. See \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management-Constant dollar currency\" below for further discussion of constant currency disclosures. We manage our business within four reportable segments, see Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nKey Business Metrics Evaluated by Management\nRevenues\nWe primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management and franchise fees, other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and other revenues. Management uses revenues to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends such as consumer demand, brand preference, and competition. For a detailed discussion of the factors that affect our revenues, see \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Revenues.\"\nNet Income Attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation\nNet income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation represents the total earnings or profits generated by our business. Management uses net income to analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and EBITDA\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA throughout this annual report. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as we define them, are non-GAAP measures (as defined below). We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\n \u2022 interest expense; \n \u2022 provision for income taxes; \n \u2022 depreciation and amortization; \n \u2022 equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; \n \u2022 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 gains (losses) on sales of real estate; \n \u2022 asset impairments; and \n \u2022 other income (loss), net. \nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. See \"-Results of Operations.\"\nOur board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA, or some combination of both.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making compensation decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management addresses these limitations by reference to our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. See our consolidated statements of income in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nFor a reconciliation of net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation to EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, see \"-Results of Operations.\"\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis since it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations, both on a segment and consolidated basis. See \"-Results of Operations\" for a reconciliation of selling, general, and administrative expenses to Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nConstant Dollar Currency\nWe report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period's exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results.\nRevenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\nRevPAR is the product of ADR and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry.\nRevPAR changes driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food\nand beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs.\nAverage Daily Rate\nADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotels' available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.\nComparable Hotels\n\"Comparable systemwide hotels\" represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the EAME/SW Asia management and franchising segment. \"Comparable operated hotels\" is defined the same as \"comparable systemwide hotels\" with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise. \"Comparable owned and leased hotels\" represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry. \"Non-comparable systemwide hotels\" or \"Non-comparable owned and leased hotels\" represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of \"comparable\" as defined above.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nPrincipal Components\nWe primarily derive our revenues from the following sources:\nRevenues from hotel operations. Represents revenues derived from hotel operations, including room rentals and food and beverage sales, and other ancillary revenues at our owned and leased properties. Revenues from the majority of our hotel operations depend heavily on demand from group and transient travelers, as discussed below. Revenues from our owned and leased hotels are primarily derived from hotel operations.\nRevenues from room rentals and ancillary revenues are primarily derived from three categories of customers: transient, group, and contract. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve a minimum of 10 rooms for meetings or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious, or other organizations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services, such as catering and banquet services. Our contract guests are traveling under a contract negotiated for a block of rooms for more than 30 days in duration at agreed-upon rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels.\nManagement and franchise fees. Represents revenues derived from fees earned from hotels and residential properties managed worldwide (usually under long-term management agreements), franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands (usually under long-term franchise agreements), termination fees, the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement, and license fees received in connection with\nvacation ownership properties. For a detailed discussion of our management and franchise fees, see Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Management Agreements-Fees\" and Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Franchise Agreements-Fees.\"\nOther revenues. Represents revenues primarily related to our co-branded credit card and exhale.\nOther revenues from managed and franchised properties. Represents revenues related primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties that are fully reimbursed by the third-party property owner based on the costs incurred, with no added margin. As a result, these revenues have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total revenues and the corresponding costs increase our total expenses. We record these revenues in \"Other revenues from managed and franchised properties\" and the corresponding costs in \"Other costs from managed and franchised properties\" in our consolidated statements of income.\nIntersegment eliminations. We evaluate our reportable segments with intersegment revenues and expenses included in their results. These intersegment revenues and expenses represent management fee revenues and expenses related to our owned and leased hotels and promotional award redemption revenues and expenses related to our co-branded credit card at our owned and leased hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation.\nFactors Affecting Our Revenues\nFor other factors affecting our revenues, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nConsumer demand and global economic conditions. Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, risks related to natural or man-made disasters, lower consumer confidence, adverse political conditions, currency volatility, impacts of terrorism, and declining oil prices can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned hotel operations and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. Also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees, since it is based on hotel profit measures. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Hospitality Industry.\"\nRevPAR Statistics \n(1) Comparable systemwide hotels include one select service hotel in ASPAC, which is not included in the ASPAC full service hotel statistics. The number of comparable hotels presented above includes owned and leased hotels.\nSystemwide RevPAR increased 3.3% during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by improved transient ADR and demand across each of our segments as well as increased group ADR and demand in the Americas and ASPAC. RevPAR related to owned and leased hotels increased due to increases in transient demand in the United States and Europe. Group ADR growth at our full service hotels resulted in increased group revenue despite lower group demand during 2017 compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in 2017 was lower compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in future years increased compared to 2016 driven by strong fourth quarter production. See \"- Segment Results\" for discussion of RevPAR by segment.\nCompetition. The global lodging industry is highly competitive. While lodging demand has continued to grow over the last several years, we have also seen an increase in supply, particularly in certain key markets. This increased supply can put\nsignificant pressure on ADR levels at our properties as well as those of our competitors. Despite this increased supply, our systemwide RevPAR levels have increased each year since 2009. We also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, including online travel services and peer-to-peer inventory sources, as well as industry consolidation. We believe our brand strength and ability to manage our operations in an efficient manner will help us to continue competing successfully within the global hospitality industry.\nAgreements with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. We depend on our long-term management and franchise agreements with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchising fee revenues. The success and sustainability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchising agreements and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. Our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. We believe we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees, and developers in all of our segments and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees, and developers and are not heavily concentrated with any particular third party.\nAccess to capital. The hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant amounts of capital expenditures to develop, maintain, and renovate properties. Third-party owners are required to fund these capital expenditures for the properties they own in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or franchise agreement. Access to the capital that we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues. The availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues.\nExpenses\nPrincipal Components\nWe primarily incur the following expenses:\nOwned and leased hotels expenses. Owned and leased hotels expenses reflect the expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Expenses to operate our hotels include room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs, and property expenses. Room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry, and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. Food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. Other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management (including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts), utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment, and services. Property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent, and insurance.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of management and franchise agreement intangibles and lease related intangibles.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense, including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts, for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including regional offices that support our management and franchising segments), professional fees (including consulting, audit, and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, sales and marketing expenses, bad debt expenses, and office administrative and related expenses.\nOther costs from managed and franchised properties. Represents costs related primarily to payroll expenses at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties. These costs are reimbursed to us with no added margin. As a result, these costs have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total expenses and the corresponding reimbursements increase our total revenues.\nFactors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses\nFor other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nFixed nature of expenses. Many of the expenses associated with developing, owning, operating, managing, franchising, and licensing hotels and other properties, including branded spas and fitness studios, and residential and vacation ownership\nproperties, are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins, and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotels segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the fixed-cost nature of our business. As a result, we may not always be able to offset reductions in revenue through cost cutting. Employees at some of our owned hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our properties and brands. We intend to manage our cost structure at levels appropriate for the degree of demand and revenue generated at our hotels.\nChanges in depreciation expenses. Changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing properties, acquisition or development of new properties, or the disposition of existing properties through sale or closure. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in businesses, properties, or other assets. If we consummate such acquisitions in businesses, properties, or other assets, we would likely add depreciable assets, which would result in an increase in depreciation expenses.\nOther Items\nAsset impairments\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments. We evaluate these assets on a quarterly basis for impairment as further discussed in \"-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\" These evaluations have, in the past, resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets. We may be required to take additional impairment charges to reflect further declines in our asset and/or investment values.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, and significant renovations\nWe routinely acquire, divest, or undertake large scale renovations of hotel properties. The results of operations derived from these properties do not, therefore, meet the definition of \"comparable hotels\" as defined in \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management.\" The results of operations from these properties, however, may have a material effect on our results from period to period and are, therefore, addressed separately in our discussion on results of operations when material.\nIn 2017, we entered into the following key transactions:\n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa as a portfolio for a net sales price of $296 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser for each property; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress for a net sales price of $202 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Louisville for a net sales price of $65 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course for a net sales price of $58 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and \n \u2022 acquired Miraval, the renowned provider of wellness and mindfulness experiences, for $237 million.  In 2016, we entered into the following key transactions:\n \u2022 acquired Thompson Miami Beach for a purchase price of approximately $238 million. The hotel was subsequently rebranded as The Confidante Miami Beach, and added to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt; \n \u2022 acquired our partners'", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, \"Selected Financial Data\" and Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Consolidated Financial Statements.\" In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2017, our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 719 full and select service hotels (182,913 rooms), including:\n \u2022 305 managed properties (99,114 rooms), all of which we operate under management agreements with third-party property owners; \n \u2022 348 franchised properties (57,489 rooms), all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties; \n \u2022 31 owned properties (15,791 rooms) (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture), 1 capital leased property (171 rooms), and 7 operating leased properties (2,411 rooms), all of which we manage; and \n \u2022 23 managed properties and 4 franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures (7,937 rooms).  Our worldwide property portfolio also included:\n \u2022 3 destination wellness resorts (399 rooms), all of which we own and operate (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture); \n \u2022 6 all inclusive resorts (2,401 rooms), all of which are owned by a third party in which we hold common shares and which operates the resorts under franchise agreements with us; \n \u2022 16 vacation ownership properties, all of which are licensed by ILG under the Hyatt Residence Club brand and operated by third parties, including ILG and its affiliates; and \n \u2022 20 residential properties, which consist of branded residences and serviced apartments. We manage all of the serviced apartments and those branded residential units that participate in a rental program with an adjacent Hyatt-branded hotel.  Our worldwide property portfolio also included branded spas and fitness studios, comprised of leased and managed locations.\nWe believe our business model allows us to pursue more diversified revenue and income streams that balance both the advantages and risks associated with these lines of business. Our expertise and experience in each of these areas gives us the flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these lines of business. Growth in the number of management and franchise agreements and earnings therefrom typically results in higher overall returns on invested capital because the capital investment under a typical management or franchise agreement is not significant. The capital required to build and maintain hotels we manage or franchise for third-party owners is typically provided by the owner of the respective property with minimal capital required by us as the manager or franchisor. During periods of increasing demand, we do not share fully in the incremental profits of hotel operations for hotels we manage for third-party owners as our fee arrangements generally include a base amount calculated using the revenue from the subject hotel and an incentive fee that is, typically, a percentage of hotel profits that is usually less than 20%, with certain financial thresholds to be satisfied, with the actual level depending on the structure and terms of the management agreement. We do not share in the benefits of increases in profits from franchised properties because franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees that are calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, and also at times as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, with no fees based on profits. Disputes or disruptions may arise with third-party owners of hotels we manage, franchise, or license and these disputes can result in termination of the relevant agreement.\nWith respect to property ownership, we believe ownership of selected hotels in key markets enhances our ability to control our brand presence in these markets. Ownership of hotels allows us to capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand and room rates. The cost structure of a typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and room rates increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. Hotel ownership is, however, more capital intensive than managing hotels for third-party owners, as we are responsible for the costs and all capital expenditures for our owned hotels. The profits realized from our owned and leased hotels are generally more significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues than the results of our managed and franchised properties. This is because we absorb the full impact of declining profits for our owned and leased hotels whereas our management and franchise fees do not have the same level of downside exposure to declining hotel profitability. See also \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Expenses-Factors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses-Fixed nature of expenses.\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions, or restrict our growth strategy.\"\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 80.5%, 80.6%, and 80.7% of our revenues were derived from operations in the United States, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 76.9% and 78.4% of our long-lived assets were located in the United States, respectively.\nWe report our consolidated operations in U.S. dollars. Amounts are reported in millions, unless otherwise noted. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding and percentage changes that are not meaningful are presented as \"NM\". Constant currency disclosures throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are non-GAAP measures. See \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management-Constant dollar currency\" below for further discussion of constant currency disclosures. We manage our business within four reportable segments, see Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nKey Business Metrics Evaluated by Management\nRevenues\nWe primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management and franchise fees, other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and other revenues. Management uses revenues to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends such as consumer demand, brand preference, and competition. For a detailed discussion of the factors that affect our revenues, see \"-Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Revenues.\"\nNet Income Attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation\nNet income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation represents the total earnings or profits generated by our business. Management uses net income to analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and EBITDA\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA throughout this annual report. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as we define them, are non-GAAP measures (as defined below). We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\n \u2022 interest expense; \n \u2022 provision for income taxes; \n \u2022 depreciation and amortization; \n \u2022 equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; \n \u2022 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 gains (losses) on sales of real estate; \n \u2022 asset impairments; and \n \u2022 other income (loss), net. \nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. See \"-Results of Operations.\"\nOur board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment.

Revenues from our owned and leased hotels are primarily derived from hotel operations.\nRevenues from room rentals and ancillary revenues are primarily derived from three categories of customers: transient, group, and contract. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve a minimum of 10 rooms for meetings or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious, or other organizations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services, such as catering and banquet services. Our contract guests are traveling under a contract negotiated for a block of rooms for more than 30 days in duration at agreed-upon rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels.\nManagement and franchise fees. Represents revenues derived from fees earned from hotels and residential properties managed worldwide (usually under long-term management agreements), franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands (usually under long-term franchise agreements), termination fees, the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement, and license fees received in connection with\nvacation ownership properties. For a detailed discussion of our management and franchise fees, see Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Management Agreements-Fees\" and Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Franchise Agreements-Fees.\"\nOther revenues. Represents revenues primarily related to our co-branded credit card and exhale.\nOther revenues from managed and franchised properties. Represents revenues related primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties that are fully reimbursed by the third-party property owner based on the costs incurred, with no added margin. As a result, these revenues have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total revenues and the corresponding costs increase our total expenses. We record these revenues in \"Other revenues from managed and franchised properties\" and the corresponding costs in \"Other costs from managed and franchised properties\" in our consolidated statements of income.\nIntersegment eliminations. We evaluate our reportable segments with intersegment revenues and expenses included in their results. These intersegment revenues and expenses represent management fee revenues and expenses related to our owned and leased hotels and promotional award redemption revenues and expenses related to our co-branded credit card at our owned and leased hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation.\nFactors Affecting Our Revenues\nFor other factors affecting our revenues, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nConsumer demand and global economic conditions. Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, risks related to natural or man-made disasters, lower consumer confidence, adverse political conditions, currency volatility, impacts of terrorism, and declining oil prices can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned hotel operations and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. Also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees, since it is based on hotel profit measures. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility.

The number of comparable hotels presented above includes owned and leased hotels.\nSystemwide RevPAR increased 3.3% during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by improved transient ADR and demand across each of our segments as well as increased group ADR and demand in the Americas and ASPAC. RevPAR related to owned and leased hotels increased due to increases in transient demand in the United States and Europe. Group ADR growth at our full service hotels resulted in increased group revenue despite lower group demand during 2017 compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in 2017 was lower compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in future years increased compared to 2016 driven by strong fourth quarter production. See \"- Segment Results\" for discussion of RevPAR by segment.\nCompetition. The global lodging industry is highly competitive. While lodging demand has continued to grow over the last several years, we have also seen an increase in supply, particularly in certain key markets. This increased supply can put\nsignificant pressure on ADR levels at our properties as well as those of our competitors. Despite this increased supply, our systemwide RevPAR levels have increased each year since 2009. We also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, including online travel services and peer-to-peer inventory sources, as well as industry consolidation. We believe our brand strength and ability to manage our operations in an efficient manner will help us to continue competing successfully within the global hospitality industry.\nAgreements with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. We depend on our long-term management and franchise agreements with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchising fee revenues. The success and sustainability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchising agreements and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. Our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. We believe we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees, and developers in all of our segments and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees, and developers and are not heavily concentrated with any particular third party.\nAccess to capital. The hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant amounts of capital expenditures to develop, maintain, and renovate properties. Third-party owners are required to fund these capital expenditures for the properties they own in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or franchise agreement. Access to the capital that we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues. The availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues.\nExpenses\nPrincipal Components\nWe primarily incur the following expenses:\nOwned and leased hotels expenses. Owned and leased hotels expenses reflect the expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Expenses to operate our hotels include room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs, and property expenses. Room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry, and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. Food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. Other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management (including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts), utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment, and services. Property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent, and insurance.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of management and franchise agreement intangibles and lease related intangibles.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense, including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts, for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including regional offices that support our management and franchising segments), professional fees (including consulting, audit, and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, sales and marketing expenses, bad debt expenses, and office administrative and related expenses.\nOther costs from managed and franchised properties. Represents costs related primarily to payroll expenses at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties. These costs are reimbursed to us with no added margin. As a result, these costs have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total expenses and the corresponding reimbursements increase our total revenues.\nFactors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses\nFor other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\"\nFixed nature of expenses. Many of the expenses associated with developing, owning, operating, managing, franchising, and licensing hotels and other properties, including branded spas and fitness studios, and residential and vacation ownership\nproperties, are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins, and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotels segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the fixed-cost nature of our business. As a result, we may not always be able to offset reductions in revenue through cost cutting. Employees at some of our owned hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our properties and brands. We intend to manage our cost structure at levels appropriate for the degree of demand and revenue generated at our hotels.\nChanges in depreciation expenses. Changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing properties, acquisition or development of new properties, or the disposition of existing properties through sale or closure. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in businesses, properties, or other assets. If we consummate such acquisitions in businesses, properties, or other assets, we would likely add depreciable assets, which would result in an increase in depreciation expenses.\nOther Items\nAsset impairments\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments. We evaluate these assets on a quarterly basis for impairment as further discussed in \"-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\" These evaluations have, in the past, resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets. We may be required to take additional impairment charges to reflect further declines in our asset and/or investment values.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, and significant renovations\nWe routinely acquire, divest, or undertake large scale renovations of hotel properties. The results of operations derived from these properties do not, therefore, meet the definition of \"comparable hotels\" as defined in \"-Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management.\" The results of operations from these properties, however, may have a material effect on our results from period to period and are, therefore, addressed separately in our discussion on results of operations when material.\nIn 2017, we entered into the following key transactions:\n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa as a portfolio for a net sales price of $296 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser for each property; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress for a net sales price of $202 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Louisville for a net sales price of $65 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; \n \u2022 sold Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course for a net sales price of $58 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and \n \u2022 acquired Miraval, the renowned provider of wellness and mindfulness experiences, for $237 million.  In 2016, we entered into the following key transactions:\n \u2022 acquired Thompson Miami Beach for a purchase price of approximately $238 million. The hotel was subsequently rebranded as The Confidante Miami Beach, and added to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt; \n \u2022 acquired our partners'"}
