MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOur principal operating subsidiary is Pacific Mercantile Bank (the Bank\u201d), which is a California state chartered bank. The Bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues, expenses and income and our consolidated assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the following discussion focuses primarily on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total assets, net loans and total deposits were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nThe Bank, which is headquartered in Orange County, California, approximately 40 miles south of Los Angeles, conducts a commercial banking business in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured, to the maximum extent permitted by law, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we operated as one reportable segment, Commercial Banking.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d ours,\u201d and us\u201d refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) and the Federal Reserve's response to the economic challenges during 2020 has resulted in an uncertain and rapidly evolving economy. Governmental response to combat this pandemic have resulted in approximately 25% of our staff to shift to work either partially or fully remote. Our business continuity plans have been activated by COVID-19 and we have been able to fully support our remote workforce and have the ability to support all employees in a remote work environment. These remote work arrangements have not adversely impacted our ability to serve our clients, and have not had an impact on our financial reporting systems or the internal controls we have over financial reporting, disclosures and related procedures.\nThe most significant impact of COVID-19 on our business has been to the quality of our loan portfolio and to net interest income as short-term interest rates sharply declined. We have increased the qualitative factors used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease loss in anticipation of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our clients and their ability to fulfill their obligations. We have no certainty that the provisions we made during 2020 will be sufficient to absorb the losses that stem from the impact of COVID-19 on our clients. As the longer term effects on our clients from the COVID-19 pandemic become more apparent, we may need to charge-off some or all of the balance on certain loans and make further provisions to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. These potential additional provisions for loan and lease losses will have a direct impact upon our capital, including the potential need to reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. At this time, we don't expect that there would be any material impairment to the valuation of other long-lived assets, right of use assets, or our investment securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank had capital ratios exceeding the minimums required to be qualified as a well capitalized\u201d institution under federally mandated capital standards and federally established prompt corrective active regulations, with approximately $68 million of capital in excess of what is required for the Bank to be qualified as well capitalized using the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets. The Company has approximately $10 million of capital that it could contribute to the Bank should it be needed. In the event that future loan and leases loss and/or tax provisions reduce our capital surplus, we would be required to undertake measures to return the Bank's capital ratios to well capitalized levels, which could include but not be limited to raising additional capital or reducing the Bank's asset size. We believe that we would have access to equity and debt markets to secure additional capital for the Bank should the need arise, but we have no certainty regarding the extent of the availability of these markets at the time such need would arise.\nIncreased demand for liquidity by our clients is another impact that we anticipate could occur should the COVID-19 effects be prolonged. As of December 31, 2020 the Company and the Bank's on-balance sheet liquidity was very strong and combined with our contingent liquidity resources, we believe that the Bank has sufficient resources to meet the liquidity needs of our clients. In response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has made other provisions that could assist the Bank in satisfying its liquidity needs, such as reducing our reserve requirement to zero, expanding access to the discount window through collateral pledging and extension of term borrowings.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, were as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018\n% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>8,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan and lease losses </td> <td>9,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income </td> <td>6,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td>36,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit) </td> <td>4,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,752) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(119.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income allocable to common shareholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(79.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest income decreased 7.7% to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income on short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year as a result of lower average yields in the declining interest rate environment of the current year. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income on loans was $58.7 million and $59.3 million, respectively, yielding 4.68% and 5.39% on average loan balances of $1.26 billion and $1.10 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to the funding of $281.0 million of PPP loans. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $939 thousand and $1.1 million, yielding 2.57% and 2.90% on average balances of $36.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $1.0 million and $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, yielding 0.33% and 2.20% on average balances of $286.4 million and $239.3 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The decrease in the average yield is a result of the declining interest rate environment in the latter half of 2019 through early 2020. As a result, total interest income on investments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest income increased 5.0% to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in average balances, as well as an increase in the average yields. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income on loans was $59.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, yielding 5.39% and 5.38% on average loan balances of $1.10 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to an increase in loan demand. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.78% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, yielding 2.90% and 2.92% on average balances of $36.7 million and $39.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2019Aqw, which was partially offset by purchases during the second half of\nthe year. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the FHLB special dividend of $83 thousand during December 2018. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $5.3 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, yielding 2.20% and 1.92% on average balances of $239.3 million and $195.7 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The increase in the average yield is a result of the rising interest rate environment throughout 2018 and early 2019, offset by decreasing rates in the latter half of 2019. As a result, total interest income on investments increased for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest expense decreased 46.6% to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.00% at December 31, 2020 from 1.85% at December 31, 2019, which was primarily the result of our ongoing focus on reducing costs of deposits by monitoring and lowering interest rates in response to the current interest rate environment and actively managing our deposit portfolio away from higher costing money market deposits and certificates of deposit and into noninterest bearing deposits. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $4.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 1.98% and 2.26% on average balances of $248.8 million and $265.9 million, respectively.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest expense increased 18.4% to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume of and average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.85% at December 31, 2019 from 1.60% at December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition and our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our non-maturity interest bearing deposits and our certificates of deposit while in a rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our FHLB borrowings. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 2.26% and 1.70%, on average balances of $265.9 million and $315.2 million, respectively.\nNet Interest Margin\nOne of the principal determinants of a bank's income is its net interest income, which is the difference between (i) the interest that a bank earns on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, on the one hand, and (ii) its interest expense, which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities, on the other hand. As a general rule, all other things being equal, the greater the difference or spread\u201d between the amount of our interest income and the amount of our interest expense, the greater will be our net income; whereas, a decline in that difference or spread\u201d will generally result in a decline in our net income.\nA bank's interest income and interest expense are affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of its control, including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board which affect interest rates, competition in the market place for loans and deposits, the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Net interest income, when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets, is a banking organization's net interest margin.\u201d\nAs a result of the Federal Reserve Board decreasing interest rates by 150 basis points during the first quarter of 2020, we experienced a reduction in our net interest margin. The unfavorable impact of lower prevailing interest rates on our asset-sensitive balance sheet was evidenced in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While we are unable to ascertain whether the Federal Reserve Board will continue to decrease short-term interest rates in the future, we expect the unfavorable impact on our net interest margin will remain in the event that interest rates continue to fall. However, we believe the management of our deposit costs to correspond with declining interest rates would partially offset the contractual decrease in the yield on earning assets.\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our average balance sheet, yields on interest earning assets, interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread and the interest rate margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Average balances are calculated based on average daily balances.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

ordinary course of the banking business. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced ( written down\u201d) to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan charge-off\u201d). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of probable loan losses due to financial performance of borrowers, the value of collateral securing non-performing loans or changing economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a provision for loan and lease losses\u201d that is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. Increases in the ALLL are also recognized through the recovery of charged-off loans which are added back to the ALLL. As such, recoveries are a direct offset for a provision for loan and lease losses that would otherwise be needed to replenish or increase the ALLL.\nWe employ economic models and data that conform to bank regulatory guidelines and reflect sound industry practices as well as our own historical loan loss experience to determine the sufficiency of the ALLL and any provisions needed to increase or replenish the ALLL. Those determinations involve judgments and assumptions about current economic conditions and external events that can impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations. However, the duration and impact of these factors cannot be determined with any certainty. As such, unanticipated changes in economic or market conditions, bank regulatory guidelines or the sound practices that are used to determine the sufficiency of the ALLL, could require us to record additional, and possibly significant, provisions to increase the ALLL. This would have the effect of reducing reportable income or, in the most extreme circumstance, creating a reportable loss. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank and the CDFPI, as an integral part of their regulatory oversight, periodically review the adequacy of our ALLL. These agencies may require us to make additional provisions for perceived potential loan losses, over and above the provisions that we have already made, the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur.\nWe recorded a $9.1 million provision for loan and lease losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of total net charge-offs of $5.2 million, an increase in classified and non-performing loans, and qualitative factor increases related to COVID-19 during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $9.2 million as a result of total net charge-offs of $9.0 million, an increase in classified and non-performing loans, and growth in our loan portfolio during the year. We recorded no provision for loan and lease losses during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of reserves for new loan growth being offset by a decline in the level of classified assets.\nSee \"-Financial Condition-Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" below in this Item 7 for additional information regarding the ALLL.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in noninterest income in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees on deposits and other banking services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of securities available for sale </td> <td>171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on sale of other assets </td> <td>(147) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>950.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of Small Business Administration loans </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noninterest income </td> <td>2,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 vs. 2019\nNoninterest income increased by $749 thousand, or 13.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of:\n\u2022An increase of $1.4 million in deposit related fees, credit card fees and loan service fees during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as the result of modifications to our loan and deposit fee structure;

Management performed an evaluation of the tax relief measures available, and determined there was no significant impact to our Company, and therefore, no tax relief provisions were applied.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we had an income tax expense of $4.1 million. The income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily a result of our operating income partially offset by an adjustment made to our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter to true up stock based compensation. Accounting rules specify that management must evaluate the deferred tax asset on a recurring basis to determine whether enough positive evidence exists to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be available to offset or reduce future taxes. The tax code allows net operating losses incurred prior to December 31, 2017 to be carried forward for 20 years from the date of the loss, and based on its evaluation, management believes that the Company will be able to realize the deferred tax asset within the period that our net operating losses may be carried forward. Due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, management determined that there continued to be enough positive evidence to support no valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020. Significant positive evidence included our three-year cumulative income position, the expectation that we will continue to have positive earnings based on positive income in eleven of the last twelve trailing quarters, and a shift from accumulated deficit to retained earnings during the year. Negative evidence included our net loss for the first quarter of 2020 and deterioration in asset quality.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had an income tax expense of $2.1 million. The income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily a result of our operating income partially offset by an adjustment made to our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter to true up stock based compensation. Accounting rules specify that management must evaluate the deferred tax asset on a recurring basis to determine whether enough positive evidence exists to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be available to offset or reduce future taxes.

Due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, management determined that there continued to be enough positive evidence to support no valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset at December 31, 2019. Significant positive evidence included our three-year cumulative income position and the expectation that we will continue to have positive earnings based on thirteen trailing quarters of positive income and our forecast. Negative evidence included our accumulated deficit and deterioration in asset quality.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an income tax benefit of $10.8 million. The income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2018 is as a result of our net income during the year and the release of our full valuation allowance of $11.1 million on our net deferred tax asset during the second quarter of 2018, discussed further below. Accounting rules specify that management must evaluate the deferred tax asset on a recurring basis to determine whether enough positive evidence exists to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be available to offset or reduce future taxes. The tax code allows net operating losses incurred prior to December 31, 2017 to be carried forward for 20 years from the date of the loss, and based on its evaluation, management believes that the Company will be able to realize the deferred tax asset within the period that our net operating losses may be carried forward. Due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, management determined that there continued to be enough positive evidence to support no valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset at December 31, 2018. Significant positive evidence included our three-year cumulative income position, continued improvement in asset quality, and the expectation that we will continue to have positive earnings based on nine trailing quarters of positive income and our forecast. Negative evidence included our accumulated deficit.\nSee \"-Critical Accounting Policies - Utilization and Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Benefits\u201d below for additional information regarding our deferred tax asset.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets\nOur total consolidated assets increased by $171 million at December 31, 2020 from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2019.

Securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs, interest rates, or prepayment risks or other similar factors, are classified as securities available for sale\u201d. Such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses, respectively, and are reported as Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet, rather than included in or deducted from our earnings.\nThe following is a summary of the major components of

and 2018, U.S. agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with an aggregate fair market value of $2.0 million, $9.2 million and $18.2 million, respectively, were pledged to secure FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, local agency deposits and treasury, tax and loan accounts.\nThe amortized cost of securities available for sale at December 31, 2020 is shown in the table below by contractual maturities taking into consideration historical prepayments based on the prior twelve months of principal payments. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities and historical prepayments, particularly with respect to collateralized mortgage obligations, primarily because prepayment rates are affected by changes in conditions in the interest rate market and, therefore, future prepayment rates may differ from historical prepayment rates.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We have determined that declines in the fair values of these investments below their respective amortized costs, as set forth in the tables above, are temporary because (i) those declines were due to interest rate changes and not to a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of those investment securities, and (ii) we have the ability to hold those securities until there is a recovery in their values or until their maturity.\nLoans\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 will continue to have an impact on our loan portfolio as we experience a prolonged period of economic uncertainty that affects a broad range of industries in which our customers operate. Disruptions to our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. As a result of these risks, we have provided for additional losses in our provision for loan and lease losses with increased qualitative factors to reflect the current economic environment. Our participation in the PPP has allowed us to assist hundreds of our customers in securing funding from the SBA. The Bank was able to begin processing applications for PPP loans on April 3, 2020, the very first day the SBA began accepting applications, due to the preparations made by the Bank at the end of the first quarter. The Bank has been able to process loan applications for approximately $281 million, which was largely for the benefit of the Bank's existing clients who have been impacted by COVID-19. Our loan growth during the year is primarily due to these loans funded under the PPP.\nThe following table sets forth the composition, by loan category, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans, excluding PPP </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>444,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans -

Non-performing loans consist of (i) loans on non-accrual status which are loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and include restructured loans when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans, and (ii) loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Non-performing assets are comprised of non-performing loans and OREO, which consists of real properties which we have acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure and which we intend to offer for sale.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when, in our opinion, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than 90 days past due, unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and the loan is in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on non-accrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances involved in that loan's delinquency. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of unpaid amounts on such a loan are applied to reduce principal when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case such payments are applied to interest and are credited to income. Non-accrual loans may be restored to accrual status if and when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans which, based on our non-accrual policy, do not require non-accrual treatment.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the CARES Act was passed by Congress in response to COVID-19 to encourage lenders to provide assistance in the form of loan modifications to borrowers negatively impacted by the pandemic. Loan modifications provided under the CARES Act are not classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) or considered impaired if the borrowers were current as of December 31, 2019 and their ability to pay was impacted by COVID-19. The loan modifications we provided were limited to payment deferrals and the majority of borrowers that received loan deferrals earlier in the year have now returned to normal payment schedules. As of December 31, 2020, we had 16 loans with an outstanding balance of $20.4 million that were under a payment deferral.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our nonperforming

assets increased by approximately $30.0 million, or 189%, to $40.1 million as of December 31, 2020 from $15.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in non-performing loans to $39.9 million as of December 31, 2020 from $15.7 million the prior year, and an increase of $5.7 million to loans past due 90 days and still accruing. The increase in our non-performing loans resulted primarily from $42.7 million of additions during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by charge-offs of $6.3 million, $11.4 million of payoffs or paydowns on our nonaccrual loans, and the transfer of $693 thousand to other assets. The increase in our other\nforeclosed assets balance from December 31, 2020 related to the addition of $802 thousand of foreclosed automobiles, partially offset by sale proceeds of $580 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInformation Regarding Impaired Loans. At December 31, 2020, loans deemed impaired totaled $39.9 million as compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2019. We had an average investment in impaired loans of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The interest that would have been earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 had the nonaccruing impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was approximately $1.8 million.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of impaired loans to which a portion of the ALLL has been specifically allocated, and the aggregate amount so allocated, in accordance with ASC 310-10, and the amount of the ALLL and the amount of impaired loans for which no such allocations were made, in each case at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Reserves for\nLoan Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nReserves to\nLoans </td> <td> </td> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Reserves for\nLoan Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nReserves to\nLoans </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired loans with specific reserves </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired loans without specific reserves </td> <td>19,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impaired loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $24.2 million increase in impaired loans to $39.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $15.7 million at December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to additions of $42.7 million to impaired loans, partially offset by $6.3 million of charge-offs, $11.4 million in principal payments, and $693 thousand transferred to other assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on an internal analysis, using the current estimated fair values of the collateral or the discounted present values of the future estimated cash flows of the impaired loans, we concluded that, at December 31, 2020, specific reserves of $2.7 million were required on $20.0 million of impaired loans, and the remaining $20.0 million of impaired loans were well secured and adequately collateralized with no specific reserves required.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The ALLL totaled $17.5 million, representing 1.43% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, as compared to $13.6 million, or 1.21% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019. Total loans at December 31, 2020 included $229.7 million of PPP loans that are 100% government guaranteed and do not carry an allowance. The ALLL to total loans excluding the PPP loans at December 31, 2020 was 1.76%, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations. Those factors are inherently subjective as the process for determining the adequacy of the ALLL involves some significant estimates and assumptions about such matters such as (i) economic conditions and trends and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows of borrowers which can affect their ability to meet their loan obligations to us, (ii) the fair value of the collateral securing non-performing loans, (iii) estimates of losses that we may incur on non-performing loans, which are determined on the basis of historical loss experience and industry loss factors and bank regulatory guidelines, which are subject to change, and (iv) various qualitative factors. Since those factors are subject to changes in economic and other conditions and changes in regulatory guidelines or other circumstances over which we have no control, the amount of the ALLL may prove to be insufficient to cover all of the loan losses we might incur in the future. In such an event, it may become necessary for us to increase the ALLL from time to time to maintain its adequacy. Such increases are effectuated by means of a charge to income, referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses\u201d, in our statements of our operations. See -Results of Operations- Provision for Loan and Lease Losses, above in this Item 7.\nThe amount of the ALLL is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans. All non-accrual loans and other loans classified as Special Mention,\u201d Substandard\u201d or Doubtful\u201d ( classified loans\u201d or classification categories\u201d) and not fully collateralized are then assigned specific reserves within the ALLL, with greater reserve allocations made to loans deemed to be of a higher risk. These ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors, by type of loan, adjusted for current economic factors and current economic trends. Refer to Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for definitions related to our credit quality indicators stated above.\nOn a quarterly basis, we utilize a classification based loan loss migration model as well as review individual loans in determining the adequacy of the ALLL. Our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type, except certain consumer loans (automobile, mortgage and credit cards), which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools. These calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances. We analyze impaired loans individually.\nIn determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the ALLL, we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolio. Such qualitative factors include:\n\u2022The effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios;\n\u2022Trends and changes in local, regional and national economic conditions, as well as changes in industry specific conditions, and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolios;\n\u2022Material changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter, whether positively or negatively, the risk profile of those portfolios;\n\u2022Changes in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could, either positively or negatively, impact the application of our loan underwriting standards, the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts; and\n\u2022External factors that, in addition to economic conditions, can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations, such as fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks and the impact of COVID-19.\nDetermining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of each category of loans in our loan portfolio requires numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates about conditions, trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control. Moreover, the effects of qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify. As a result, we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the ALLL or that may even exceed the ALLL.\nSet forth below is information regarding loan balances and

non-performing loans, and qualitative factor increases related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reserve for loan losses may include an unallocated amount based upon our judgment as to possible credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio that may not have been captured by historical loss experience, qualitative factors, or specific evaluations of impaired loans. Unallocated reserves may be adjusted for factors including, but not limited to, unexpected or unusual events, volatile market and economic conditions, effects of changes or seasoning in methodologies, regulatory guidance and recommendations, or other factors that may impact borrower operating conditions and loss expectations. Management's judgment as to unallocated reserves is determined in the context of, but separate from, the historical loss trends and qualitative factors described above. There was no unallocated reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2020 which is a decrease of $76 thousand from the balance at December 31, 2019, primarily due to charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2020. Management believes that the amount of unallocated reserve for loan losses is appropriate and will continue to evaluate it on an ongoing basis.\nWe classify our loan portfolios using asset quality ratings. The credit quality table in Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, provides a summary of loans by portfolio type and asset quality ratings as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Loans totaled approximately $1.22 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $97.5 million from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2019. The disaggregation of the loan portfolio by risk rating in the credit quality table located in Note 5 reflects the following changes that occurred between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020:\n\u2022Loans rated Pass\u201d totaled $1.112 billion, an increase of $50.8 million from $1.061 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the $281 million of PPP loans funded during the year in addition to upgrades from Special Mention\u201d of $16.5 million, and new loan growth, partially offset by downgrades of $54.8 million and $51.5 million to Special Mention\u201d and Substandard\u201d, respectively, and paydowns of principal.\n\u2022Loans rated Special Mention\u201d totaled $21.8 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from $28.3 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of $54.8 million downgraded from Pass\u201d and additional outstanding balances of $1.8 million on lines of credit, partially offset by $16.5 million upgraded to \"Pass\", $34.5 million downgraded to \"Substandard\", and $12.9 million of payoffs and principal payments.\n\u2022Loans rated Substandard\u201d totaled $89.6 million, an increase of $52.6 million from $37.0 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily the result of $51.5 million downgraded from \"Pass\", $34.2 million downgraded from \"Special Mention\", partially offset by $3.8 million downgraded to \"Doubtful\", $5.0 million of loans charged-off, and $16.3 million in principal payments.\n\u2022Loans rated Doubtful\u201d totaled $641 thousand at December 31, 2020, an increase from zero at December 31, 2019.\nOur loss migration analysis currently utilizes a series of nineteen staggered 16-quarter migration periods, which was increased during the second quarter of 2015 from four staggered 16-quarter migration periods in order to broaden the loss experience incorporated into the analysis. As a result, for purposes of determining applicable loss factors at December 31, 2020, our migration analysis covered the period from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019. We believe this was consistent with and reasonably reflects current economic conditions, portfolio trends and the risks that were inherent in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.\nThe table below sets forth loan delinquencies, by quarter, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans Delinquent: </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90 days or more: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td>1,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgages </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>11,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30-89 days: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans </td> <td>8,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,715 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgages </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>8,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Past Due(1):\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Past due balances include nonaccrual loans.\nAs the above table indicates, total past due loans increased by $17.2 million, or 518.9%, to $20.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $3.3 million at December 31, 2019.

We project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain liquid funds for unanticipated events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our primary sources of cash include cash we have on deposit at other financial institutions, payments from borrowers on their loans, proceeds from sales or maturities of securities held for sale, increases in deposits and increases in borrowings principally from the FHLB. The primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit, purchasing investments, including securities available for sale, funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses. We maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short-term investments to provide for short-term liquidity needs. We also have obtained credit lines from the FHLB and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements we might have. See \"-Contractual Obligations-Borrowings\" below for additional information related to our borrowings from the FHLB.\nOur liquid assets, which included cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest earning deposits that we maintain with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale (excluding Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock) totaled $289.9 million, which represented 18% of total assets, at December 31, 2020. We believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources, together with available borrowings under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including to enable us to meet any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future. We believe that during this period of uncertain economic conditions related to COVID-19, our liquidity position is strong, and will be closely monitored as conditions change.\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. In 2020, operating activities provided net cash of $10.2 million primarily attributable to our net income of $8.3 million and provision for loan and lease losses of $9.1 million, partially offset by accretion of deferred fees on loans of $5.3 million and a decrease of $1.8 million in other liabilities. In 2019, operating activities provided net cash of $17.0 million primarily attributable to net income of $5.7 million and provision for loan and lease losses of $9.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $7.3 million in other liabilities.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities. In 2020, investing activities used net cash of $107.9 million, primarily attributable to $95.3 million used to fund an increase in loans and $22.7 million used to purchase securities available for sale and other stock, partially offset $6.1 million of cash from maturities of and principal payments on securities available for sale, and $3.5 million from the sale of securities available for sale. In 2019, investing activities used net cash of $38.7 million, primarily attributable to $43.0 million used to fund an increase in loans and $5.0 million used to purchase securities available for sale and other stock, partially offset by $8.6 million of cash from maturities of and principal payments on securities available for sale, and $1.1 million from the sale of other real estate owned properties.\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities. In 2020, financing activities provided net cash of $163.8 million, consisting primarily of a $250.1 million increase in non-interest bearing deposits, which was primarily the result of PPP loans funded by the SBA, partially offset by a $66.3 million decrease in interest bearing deposits and a net decrease of $20.0 million in FHLB borrowings. In 2019, financing activities used net cash of $54.1 million, consisting primarily of a $56.6 million increase in non-interest bearing deposits and a $7.0 million increase in interest bearing deposits, partially offset by a net decrease of $10.0 million in FHLB borrowings.\nRatio of Loans to Deposits. The relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank's liquidity. Since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources, the higher the loan-to-deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets. On the other hand, since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on investments, a lower loan-to-deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings. As a result, our goal is to achieve a loan-to-deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 88% and 94%, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nRegulatory Capital Requirements Applicable to Banking Institutions\nUnder federal banking regulations that apply to all United States-based bank holding companies over $3 billion in total assets and all federally insured banks, the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) must meet specific capital adequacy requirements that, for the most part, involve quantitative measures, primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company (on a consolidated basis) is below the reporting threshold of $3 billion in total assets and therefore exempt from these capital adequacy requirements. These regulations place a banking institution into one of five capital categories based on its regulatory capital ratios:\n\u2022well-capitalized\n\u2022adequately capitalized\n\u2022undercapitalized\n\u2022significantly undercapitalized; or\n\u2022critically undercapitalized\nCertain qualitative assessments also are made by a banking institution's primary federal regulatory agency that could lead the agency to determine that the banking institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by the quantitative measures used to assess the institution's capital adequacy. At each successive lower capital category, a banking institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total capital, common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). We believe that, as of December 31, 2020, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject and has not been notified by any regulatory agency that would require the Bank to maintain additional capital.\nThe actual capital amounts and ratios of the Bank at December 31, 2020 are presented in the following table:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Applicable Federal Regulatory Requirement </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31, 2020 </td> <td>Actual Capital </td> <td> </td> <td>For Capital Adequacy Purposes </td> <td> </td> <td>To be Categorized As Well Capitalized </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratio </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 8.625% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 10.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 5.125% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 6.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 6.625% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 8.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Capital to Average Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At least 5.0% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs the above table indicates, at December 31, 2020, the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) had capital ratios exceeding the minimums required to be qualified as a well-capitalized\u201d institution under federally mandated capital standards and federally established prompt corrective action regulations.\nDividend Policy and Share Repurchase Programs.\nIt is, and since the beginning of 2009 it has been, the policy of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank to preserve cash to enhance our capital positions and the Bank's liquidity. In addition, we have agreed that the Bank will not, without the FRB and the CDFPI's prior written approval, pay any dividends to Bancorp. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay dividends or make share repurchases for the foreseeable future.\nThe principal source of cash available to a bank holding company consists of cash dividends from its bank subsidiaries. There are currently several restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay us cash dividends. Government regulations, including the laws of the State of California, as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by California state chartered banks, limits the amount of funds that the Bank is permitted to dividend to us. Further, Section 23(a) of the Federal Reserve Act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than 10% of the bank subsidiary's capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company. We have committed to obtaining approval from the FRB and the CDFPI prior to Bancorp paying any dividends, or making any distributions representing interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities. There can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments or dividends in the future. Refer to Supervision and Regulation\u201d above in Item 1 and Note 15, Shareholders' Equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding the regulatory restrictions on our and the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit. To meet the financing needs of our clients in the normal course of business, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were committed to fund certain loans including letters of credit amounting to approximately $347 million and $316 million, respectively.\nCommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the client may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit. We expect, based on historical experience, that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nTo varying degrees, commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the clients to whom such commitments are made could potentially be equal to the amount of those commitments. As a result, before making such a commitment to a client, we evaluate the client's creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the client. In addition, we often require the client to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing commercial properties, residential properties and properties under construction. As a consequence, our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee a payment obligation of a client to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to clients.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Maturity/Obligation by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,383,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Borrowings </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior Subordinated Debentures </td> <td>17,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td>11,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,422,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,357,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,527 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the period during which these obligations may be incurred, if at all.\nFHLB Borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, we had $10.0 million of outstanding borrowings obtained from the FHLB. The table below sets forth the amounts of, the interest rates we pay on, and the maturity dates of these FHLB borrowings. These borrowings had a weighted-average annualized interest rate of 1.62% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Dates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>January 25, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, $434 million of loans were pledged to secure our FHLB borrowings and to support our unfunded borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2020, we had unused borrowing capacity of $242 million with the FHLB.\nThe highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month-end during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $124 million, which consisted primarily of borrowings from the FHLB and also included $4.0 million of borrowings from the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\"PPPLF\") that was fully repaid in the fourth quarter. By comparison,\nthe highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end in 2019 consisted primarily of $55 million of borrowings from the FHLB.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures. Pursuant to rulings of the FRB, bank holding companies were permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that, subject to certain conditions, would qualify as and, therefore, augment capital for regulatory purposes. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding approximately $17.5 million principal amount of the Debentures.\nSet forth below is certain information regarding the Debentures:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original Issue Dates </td> <td>Principal Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Dates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2002 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>LIBOR plus 3.40% </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2032 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2004 </td> <td>10,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>LIBOR plus 2.00% </td> <td> </td> <td>October 2034 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Subject to the receipt of prior regulatory approval, we may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time prior to maturity.\nThese Debentures require quarterly interest payments, which are used to make quarterly distributions required to be paid on the corresponding trust preferred securities. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right, at our discretion, to defer those interest payments, and the corresponding distributions on the trust preferred securities, for up to five years. Exercise of this deferral right does not constitute a default of our obligations to pay the interest on the Debentures or the corresponding distributions that are payable on the trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2020, we were current on all interest payments. We have committed to obtaining approval from the FRB and the CDFPI prior to making any distributions representing interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities. There can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments in the future.\nOperating Lease Obligations. We lease certain facilities and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases, which include escalation clauses ranging between 2% and 6% per annum. Future minimum non-cancelable lease commitments, were as follows:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>At December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td>2,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td>2,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td>2,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 and beyond </td> <td>1,020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaturing Time Certificates of Deposits.

Certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies, because they require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the carrying value of our material assets, such as, for example, assumptions regarding economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets, such as securities available for sale and our deferred tax asset. Those assumptions and judgments are based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances. If adverse changes were to occur in the conditions, trends or other events on which our assumptions or judgments had been based, then under GAAP it could become necessary for us to reduce the carrying values of any affected assets on our balance sheet. In addition, because reductions in the carrying value of assets are sometimes effectuated by or require charges to income, such reductions also may have the effect of reducing our income.\nOur critical accounting policies consist of the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining (i) the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for loan and lease losses, (ii) the fair values of our investment securities available for sale and financial instruments, and (iii) the amount of our deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits that we believe will be able to offset income taxes in future periods.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. We maintain reserves to provide for loan and lease losses that occur in the ordinary course of the banking business. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced (\"written down\") to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan \"charge-off\"). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our ALLL. The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration or improvement in the condition of borrowers or in the value of properties securing non-performing loans or adverse changes or improvements in economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a charge, recorded as an expense in the statement of operations, referred to as the \"provision for loan and lease losses.\" Recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added back to and, therefore, to that extent increase the ALLL and reduce the amount of the provision for loan losses that might otherwise have had to be made to replenish or increase the ALLL. See \"Financial Condition-Nonperforming Assets and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" above in this Item 7 for additional information regarding the ALLL.\nFair Value of Securities Available for Sale. Under applicable accounting principles, we are required to recognize any unrealized loss or gain on the securities we hold for sale. An unrealized gain occurs when the fair value of a security available for sale increases above its amortized cost as recorded on our balance sheet. An unrealized loss occurs when the fair value of a security available for sale declines below its amortized cost as recorded on our balance sheet. As a result, we make determinations, on a quarterly basis, of the fair values of the securities available for sale in order to determine if there are any unrealized losses in those securities. When there is an active market for such a security, the determination of its fair value is based on market prices. If there is no active trading market, but such securities do trade from time to time, we rely primarily on quotes we obtain from third party vendors and securities brokers to determine the fair values of those securities. However, quotes are not always available for some securities and, in those instances, we make those fair value determinations on the basis of a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies, such as discounted cash flow analyses, matrix pricing, and option adjusted spread models, as well as fundamental analysis of the creditworthiness of the obligors under those securities. These methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds, yield, duration, Federal Reserve Board monetary policies and the supply and demand for the individual securities. Consequently, if changes were to occur in market or other conditions or the circumstances on which our earlier assumptions or judgments were based, it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of such securities, which would result in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our balance sheet. Moreover, if we conclude that reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary, it would be necessary for us to recognize an impairment loss to noninterest income in our statement of operations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. ASC 820-10-35 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). Fair value measurements are categorized into a three-level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value. Level 1, which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 3,\nwhich is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our mortgage banking assets and liabilities (included in discontinued operations) are recorded at estimated fair value. Financial instruments classified as Level 3 are generally based on unobservable inputs, and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. These assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates, could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nUtilization and Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Benefits. We record as a deferred tax asset\u201d on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions ( tax benefits\u201d) that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods. Under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations, in most cases such tax benefits will expire, if they cannot be used, within specified periods of time. Accordingly, the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods. At least once each year, or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods. If we conclude, on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us, that it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration, we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet. On the other hand, if we conclude, instead, that it has become more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration, then, we would establish, or increase any existing, reserves (commonly referred to as a valuation allowance\u201d) to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely than not that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future. The establishment of or an increase in that valuation allowance is implemented by recognizing a non-cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision, or reducing any credit, for income taxes that we would otherwise have recorded in our statements of operations. The determination of whether and the extent to which we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset involves significant judgments and assumptions that are subject to period to period changes as a result of changes in tax laws, changes in market or economic conditions that could affect our operating results or variances between our actual operating results and the operating results that we had projected for any such period, as well as other factors.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of Pacific Mercantile Bancorp, with a focus on its principal operating subsidiary, Pacific Mercantile Bank.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOur principal operating subsidiary is Pacific Mercantile Bank (the Bank\u201d), which is a California state chartered bank. The Bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues, expenses and income and our consolidated assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the following discussion focuses primarily on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total assets, net loans and total deposits were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nThe Bank, which is headquartered in Orange County, California, approximately 40 miles south of Los Angeles, conducts a commercial banking business in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured, to the maximum extent permitted by law, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we operated as one reportable segment, Commercial Banking.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d ours,\u201d and us\u201d refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) and the Federal Reserve's response to the economic challenges during 2020 has resulted in an uncertain and rapidly evolving economy. Governmental response to combat this pandemic have resulted in approximately 25% of our staff to shift to work either partially or fully remote. Our business continuity plans have been activated by COVID-19 and we have been able to fully support our remote workforce and have the ability to support all employees in a remote work environment. These remote work arrangements have not adversely impacted our ability to serve our clients, and have not had an impact on our financial reporting systems or the internal controls we have over financial reporting, disclosures and related procedures.\nThe most significant impact of COVID-19 on our business has been to the quality of our loan portfolio and to net interest income as short-term interest rates sharply declined. We have increased the qualitative factors used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease loss in anticipation of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our clients and their ability to fulfill their obligations. We have no certainty that the provisions we made during 2020 will be sufficient to absorb the losses that stem from the impact of COVID-19 on our clients. As the longer term effects on our clients from the COVID-19 pandemic become more apparent, we may need to charge-off some or all of the balance on certain loans and make further provisions to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. These potential additional provisions for loan and lease losses will have a direct impact upon our capital, including the potential need to reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. At this time, we don't expect that there would be any material impairment to the valuation of other long-lived assets, right of use assets, or our investment securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank had capital ratios exceeding the minimums required to be qualified as a well capitalized\u201d institution under federally mandated capital standards and federally established prompt corrective active regulations, with approximately $68 million of capital in excess of what is required for the Bank to be qualified as well capitalized using the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets. The Company has approximately $10 million of capital that it could contribute to the Bank should it be needed. In the event that future loan and leases loss and/or tax provisions reduce our capital surplus, we would be required to undertake measures to return the Bank's capital ratios to well capitalized levels, which could include but not be limited to raising additional capital or reducing the Bank's asset size. We believe that we would have access to equity and debt markets to secure additional capital for the Bank should the need arise, but we have no certainty regarding the extent of the availability of these markets at the time such need would arise.\nIncreased demand for liquidity by our clients is another impact that we anticipate could occur should the COVID-19 effects be prolonged. As of December 31, 2020 the Company and the Bank's on-balance sheet liquidity was very strong and combined with our contingent liquidity resources, we believe that the Bank has sufficient resources to meet the liquidity needs of our clients. In response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has made other provisions that could assist the Bank in satisfying its liquidity needs, such as reducing our reserve requirement to zero, expanding access to the discount window through collateral pledging and extension of term borrowings.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, were as follows:\n\nInterest Income\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest income decreased 7.7% to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income on short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year as a result of lower average yields in the declining interest rate environment of the current year. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income on loans was $58.7 million and $59.3 million, respectively, yielding 4.68% and 5.39% on average loan balances of $1.26 billion and $1.10 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to the funding of $281.0 million of PPP loans. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $939 thousand and $1.1 million, yielding 2.57% and 2.90% on average balances of $36.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $1.0 million and $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, yielding 0.33% and 2.20% on average balances of $286.4 million and $239.3 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The decrease in the average yield is a result of the declining interest rate environment in the latter half of 2019 through early 2020. As a result, total interest income on investments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest income increased 5.0% to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in average balances, as well as an increase in the average yields. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income on loans was $59.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, yielding 5.39% and 5.38% on average loan balances of $1.10 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to an increase in loan demand. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.78% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, yielding 2.90% and 2.92% on average balances of $36.7 million and $39.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2019Aqw, which was partially offset by purchases during the second half of\nthe year. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the FHLB special dividend of $83 thousand during December 2018. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $5.3 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, yielding 2.20% and 1.92% on average balances of $239.3 million and $195.7 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The increase in the average yield is a result of the rising interest rate environment throughout 2018 and early 2019, offset by decreasing rates in the latter half of 2019. As a result, total interest income on investments increased for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest expense decreased 46.6% to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.00% at December 31, 2020 from 1.85% at December 31, 2019, which was primarily the result of our ongoing focus on reducing costs of deposits by monitoring and lowering interest rates in response to the current interest rate environment and actively managing our deposit portfolio away from higher costing money market deposits and certificates of deposit and into noninterest bearing deposits. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $4.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 1.98% and 2.26% on average balances of $248.8 million and $265.9 million, respectively.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest expense increased 18.4% to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume of and average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.85% at December 31, 2019 from 1.60% at December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition and our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our non-maturity interest bearing deposits and our certificates of deposit while in a rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our FHLB borrowings. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 2.26% and 1.70%, on average balances of $265.9 million and $315.2 million, respectively.\nNet Interest Margin\nOne of the principal determinants of a bank's income is its net interest income, which is the difference between (i) the interest that a bank earns on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, on the one hand, and (ii) its interest expense, which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities, on the other hand. As a general rule, all other things being equal, the greater the difference or spread\u201d between the amount of our interest income and the amount of our interest expense, the greater will be our net income; whereas, a decline in that difference or spread\u201d will generally result in a decline in our net income.\nA bank's interest income and interest expense are affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of its control, including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board which affect interest rates, competition in the market place for loans and deposits, the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Net interest income, when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets, is a banking organization's net interest margin.\u201d\nAs a result of the Federal Reserve Board decreasing interest rates by 150 basis points during the first quarter of 2020, we experienced a reduction in our net interest margin. The unfavorable impact of lower prevailing interest rates on our asset-sensitive balance sheet was evidenced in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While we are unable to ascertain whether the Federal Reserve Board will continue to decrease short-term interest rates in the future, we expect the unfavorable impact on our net interest margin will remain in the event that interest rates continue to fall. However, we believe the management of our deposit costs to correspond with declining interest rates would partially offset the contractual decrease in the yield on earning assets.\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our average balance sheet, yields on interest earning assets, interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread and the interest rate margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Average balances are calculated based on average daily balances.\n\n \n(1)Short-term investments consist of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits that we maintain at other financial institutions.\n(2)Stock consists of FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock.\n(3)Loans include the average balance of nonaccrual loans and loan fees. The allowance for loan and lease losses is included within the \"All other assets\" line item.\nThe following table sets forth changes in interest income, including loan fees, and interest paid in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in (i) the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest-earning assets and (ii) the volumes of or the rates of interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n \n(1)Short-term investments consist of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits that we maintain at financial institutions.\n(2)Stock consists of FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nWe maintain reserves to provide for loan losses that occur in the ordinary course of the banking business. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced ( written down\u201d) to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan charge-off\u201d). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of probable loan losses due to financial performance of borrowers, the value of collateral securing non-performing loans or changing economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a provision for loan and lease losses\u201d that is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. Increases in the ALLL are also recognized through the recovery of charged-off loans which are added back to the ALLL. As such, recoveries are a direct offset for a provision for loan and lease losses that would", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

In response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has made other provisions that could assist the Bank in satisfying its liquidity needs, such as reducing our reserve requirement to zero, expanding access to the discount window through collateral pledging and extension of term borrowings.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, were as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018\n% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>8,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan and lease losses </td> <td>9,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income </td> <td>6,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td>36,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit) </td> <td>4,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,752) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(119.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income allocable to common shareholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(79.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest income decreased 7.7% to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income on short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year as a result of lower average yields in the declining interest rate environment of the current year. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income on loans was $58.7 million and $59.3 million, respectively, yielding 4.68% and 5.39% on average loan balances of $1.26 billion and $1.10 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to the funding of $281.0 million of PPP loans. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $939 thousand and $1.1 million, yielding 2.57% and 2.90% on average balances of $36.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $1.0 million and $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, yielding 0.33% and 2.20% on average balances of $286.4 million and $239.3 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The decrease in the average yield is a result of the declining interest rate environment in the latter half of 2019 through early 2020. As a result, total interest income on investments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest income increased 5.0% to $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in average balances, as well as an increase in the average yields. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income on loans was $59.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, yielding 5.39% and 5.38% on average loan balances of $1.10 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to an increase in loan demand. The average yield on interest-earning assets was 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.78% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, yielding 2.90% and 2.92% on average balances of $36.7 million and $39.7 million, respectively. The average securities balances decreased as a result of sales and maturities of, and payments on, securities throughout the year ended December 31, 2019Aqw, which was partially offset by purchases during the second half of\nthe year. The decrease in the average yield is the result of the FHLB special dividend of $83 thousand during December 2018. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was $5.3 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, yielding 2.20% and 1.92% on average balances of $239.3 million and $195.7 million, respectively. The increase in the average balance is the result of increased liquidity as a result of deposit growth. The increase in the average yield is a result of the rising interest rate environment throughout 2018 and early 2019, offset by decreasing rates in the latter half of 2019. As a result, total interest income on investments increased for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal interest expense decreased 46.6% to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.00% at December 31, 2020 from 1.85% at December 31, 2019, which was primarily the result of our ongoing focus on reducing costs of deposits by monitoring and lowering interest rates in response to the current interest rate environment and actively managing our deposit portfolio away from higher costing money market deposits and certificates of deposit and into noninterest bearing deposits. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $4.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 1.98% and 2.26% on average balances of $248.8 million and $265.9 million, respectively.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTotal interest expense increased 18.4% to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume of and average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to 1.85% at December 31, 2019 from 1.60% at December 31, 2018, which was primarily the result of new client acquisition and our decision to increase the rate of interest paid on our non-maturity interest bearing deposits and our certificates of deposit while in a rising interest rate environment, and an increase in our FHLB borrowings. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, with a cost of funds of 2.26% and 1.70%, on average balances of $265.9 million and $315.2 million, respectively.\nNet Interest Margin\nOne of the principal determinants of a bank's income is its net interest income, which is the difference between (i) the interest that a bank earns on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, on the one hand, and (ii) its interest expense, which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities, on the other hand. As a general rule, all other things being equal, the greater the difference or spread\u201d between the amount of our interest income and the amount of our interest expense, the greater will be our net income; whereas, a decline in that difference or spread\u201d will generally result in a decline in our net income.\nA bank's interest income and interest expense are affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of its control, including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board which affect interest rates, competition in the market place for loans and deposits, the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Net interest income, when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets, is a banking organization's net interest margin.\u201d\nAs a result of the Federal Reserve Board decreasing interest rates by 150 basis points during the first quarter of 2020, we experienced a reduction in our net interest margin. The unfavorable impact of lower prevailing interest rates on our asset-sensitive balance sheet was evidenced in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While we are unable to ascertain whether the Federal Reserve Board will continue to decrease short-term interest rates in the future, we expect the unfavorable impact on our net interest margin will remain in the event that interest rates continue to fall. However, we believe the management of our deposit costs to correspond with declining interest rates would partially offset the contractual decrease in the yield on earning assets.\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our average balance sheet, yields on interest earning assets, interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread and the interest rate margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Average balances are calculated based on average daily balances.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced ( written down\u201d) to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan charge-off\u201d). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d). The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of probable loan losses due to financial performance of borrowers, the value of collateral securing non-performing loans or changing economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a provision for loan and lease losses\u201d that is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. Increases in the ALLL are also recognized through the recovery of charged-off loans which are added back to the ALLL. As such, recoveries are a direct offset for a provision for loan and lease losses that would"}
