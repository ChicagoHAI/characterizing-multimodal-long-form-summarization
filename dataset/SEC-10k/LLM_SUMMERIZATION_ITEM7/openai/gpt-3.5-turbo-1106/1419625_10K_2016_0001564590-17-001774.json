Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the leading provider of Technology Business Management, or TBM, solutions. Our cloud-based platform and SaaS applications enable IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. We empower IT leaders to transform IT into a service provider, navigate the cloud transition, and shift technology resources to drive more business innovation.\nWe were founded in 2007 to deliver cloud-based TBM solutions to global enterprises. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our first TBM application via our extensible platform in 2008. Since then, we have continued to invest in product innovation and have consistently introduced new applications and capabilities to the market.\nBecause we offer our applications on a subscription basis, typically on contracts with one- to three-year terms, we have visibility into a substantial portion of future revenue. Subscription fees are based on two primary factors: (1) the customer's annual costs being managed by the applications; and (2) the applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed. For some applications, pricing is also impacted by the number of users. We recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a significant portion of subscription revenue from subscriptions to our Cost Transparency application. We sell our offerings primarily through a direct sales force and we engage in a variety of marketing activities, including traditional and online activities as well as participation in, and support of, the TBM Council, which are designed to provide sales lead generation, sales support and market awareness. Customers may subscribe for one or more of our applications, and within those applications they may choose to subscribe for all or a portion of the respective application's capabilities, which are segmented into modules. For those customers that do not initially implement all of our applications, we seek to sell additional applications and modules over time. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the number of applications deployed by existing customers. We also derive revenue from professional services. Professional services revenue includes revenue from application configuration, integration, change management, education and training services, and conference registration and sponsorship fees. This revenue is largely driven by the number and mix of implementations that we perform in a quarter.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue in North America; however, we are focused on growing our international business. Revenue generated from customers outside of North America accounted for 25%, 22% and 19% of total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information regarding revenue generated from each geographic segment, please see Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have grown significantly in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes companies across industries and sizes, and our direct sales force has historically targeted organizations with annual IT spend of $100 million or more. Beginning in 2014, we expanded the focus of our sales force to include a broader set of target customers, often referred to as the Global 10,000, which includes many companies with annual IT spend of less than $100 million. We expect these customers will account for an increasing amount of our revenue over time. A substantial majority of our revenue growth has come from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenue and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to drive continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to employee growth. We had 731 and 636 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the average annual subscription contract value from all active customers was approximately $400,000. Average annual subscription contract value has been affected by the fact that, prior to 2014, our sales force focused on selling our entire technology platform to customers, generally with very large IT\nspend, which resulted in fewer, but larger, deals as compared to today. Add-on sales to existing customers were not a primary focus. Beginning in 2014, our sales force began to focus on selling discrete applications rather than our entire platform to a broader range of customers in the Global 10,000. Under this approach, we often sell one or two applications initially and subsequently target sales opportunities for additional applications. As a result, although some period-to-period variability may be introduced with one or more large contracts, we expect average annual contract value of newly acquired customers to decrease for the foreseeable future.\nWe had total revenue of $160.6 million, $129.3 million and $106.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 24% and 21%. Subscription revenue was $130.1 million, $99.9 million and $78.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 30% and 27%. We incurred net losses of $31.6 million, $41.0 million and $32.9 million, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $200.3 million as of December 31, 2016. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a substantial positive return on these investments by retaining customers, increasing the number of applications and modules deployed by customers over time, and increasing the spend managed by our applications. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur significant upfront costs, including sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, which are expensed upfront, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, which commences when all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur objective is for each customer relationship to be profitable over its lifetime, however, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions, purchase additional applications and expand their IT spend managed by our applications. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. Our sales and marketing expense for renewals and additional sales to existing customers are significantly less than those for sales to new customers while the cost of revenue remains relatively constant. As a result, we believe the mix shift over time between new and existing customers will have a positive impact on our operating margins. Specifically, as the percentage of our annual revenue from existing customers grows relative to the annual revenue from new customers, we would expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, in which we sold 6,900,000 shares of our Class A common stock at the initial price to public of $16.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $99.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nNet Subscription Dollar Retention Rate\nWe believe that our net subscription dollar retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and increase revenue from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. Accordingly, we compare the aggregate annual contract value of our customer base at the end of the prior 12 month period, which we refer to as the base annual contract value, to the aggregate annual contract value from the same group of customers at the end of the current 12 month period, which we refer to as the retained annual contract value. We calculate our net subscription dollar retention rate on a trailing 12 month basis by dividing the retained annual contract value by the base annual contract value. In the event a customer renews a subscription for a period that begins and ends in the same 12 month period, the value of that partial-year subscription is included in our calculation of retained annual contract value. Our net subscription dollar retention rate was approximately 98% and 100% for each of the 12 month periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our offerings globally. In addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers' evolving needs. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. However, we expect research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as revenue grows, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale as our customer base grows.\nSince our inception, we have invested in professional services to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe that our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Apptio, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenue. In addition, over the long-term, we expect professional services revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our customer base continues to grow and as the effort required to deploy our solutions decreases, through product enhancements and our efforts to drive increased customer adoption of our standardized IT operating model, the Apptio TBM Unified Model, or ATUM.\nInvestment in Infrastructure\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in infrastructure that will impact cost of revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We intend to invest to support growth at our leased data centers and with public cloud infrastructure providers to deliver enhanced levels of service to our customers. We intend to continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud architecture, which are designed to provide our customers with enhanced security, scalability and availability. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our data center locations to address additional geographic markets. In addition, we may expand existing and establish new facilities in the future to accommodate our projected headcount growth at various locations around the world. We may incur substantial costs in connection with such expansion efforts, including leasehold improvements, equipment costs, and, if headcount increases faster than we expect, potentially lease termination payments to enter into new leases for larger space.\nSales Cycles\nWe target sales efforts at enterprises and face long sales cycles, complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, and a relatively low and difficult to predict volume of sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This makes it difficult to predict with certainty our sales and related operating performance in any given period. Our typical sales cycle is approximately six months, but can be highly variable. Historically we have experienced an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks of the quarter which can affect the timing of recognized revenue and the possibility that sales cycles extend beyond the end of a quarter. Extending sales cycles beyond the end of a quarter, particularly for sizeable transactions, can harm forecasting accuracy and impact billings and new customer acquisition metrics for the quarter in which they are forecasted to close.\nMeeting our financial plan in part depends on a predictable growth rate in the acquisition of new customers that represent high annual contract value, while additional growth and enhanced predictability in part depends on an increased volume of new customers with a relatively lower annual contract value. Our financial performance and the predictability of our quarterly financial results may be harmed by intermittent failures to secure the higher value enterprise agreements, or increase the volume of transactions overall, according to our forecasts, and depends in large part on the successful execution of our direct sales team.\nFocus on Free Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure that we are focused on to run our business. For a reconciliation\nof free cash flow to the related U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP measure, net cash used in operating activities, see the section captioned Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our platform, fees for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees, and fees for subscription-based online training; and (2) professional services, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our applications, as well as fees for in-person training and conference registration and sponsorship fees for the TBM Council, the operations of which we consolidate in our financial statements given the nature of our relationship.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the acquisition of new customers and renewals by existing customers, the amount of annual spend our customers are licensed to manage with our applications and the number of applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed.\nOur contracts typically vary in length between one and three years. All subscription and support fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription and support-based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. As a result, most of the revenue that we report in each period is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Pricing includes multiple environments, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription period. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, but contract lengths and billing frequencies may vary. Therefore, the annualized value of the arrangements that we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.\nA typical new customer implementation takes three to six months depending on the customer's complexity and timeliness. All professional services fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Our professional services engagements are priced on either a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. In addition, sometimes partners will perform implementation services directly to our customers for which we do not receive professional services revenue. For time-and-materials arrangements, we recognize revenue as hours are worked at the stated hourly rate. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method measured on an hours incurred basis. Professional services yield lower gross margins than subscriptions due to the labor-intensive nature of professional services.\nOn occasion, we sell our applications through third-party resellers. These arrangements typically call for the reseller to retain a portion of the subscription fee paid by the customer as compensation. Since we are typically responsible for the acceptability of the services purchased by the customer, we are the primary obligor in the transaction and, therefore, record revenue on a gross basis based on the amount billed to the customer. Reseller fees are recognized as sales and marketing expense as incurred.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our technology operations and customer support teams, fees paid to our managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which include rent, facilities and costs related to internal IT. We expect cost of subscription revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nSubscription gross margin, or subscription revenue less cost of subscription revenue expressed as a percentage of subscription revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of the fees that we pay to our hosting providers and other third- party service providers, and the timing and extent of the investments that we make in additional data center infrastructure and capabilities. Due to investments we made in additional data centers and public cloud hosting capabilities prior to December 31, 2015, we expect subscription gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above. Because we have data centers in each of our three primary geographies, we expect to be able to more efficiently add capacity within these data centers to support our anticipated customer growth.\nCost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, employee benefits, travel expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, as well as allocated overhead costs. Cost of professional services excludes costs associated with TBM Council conferences, which we record as sales and marketing expenses. We expect cost of professional services revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we further expand our professional services organization to serve our growing customer base.\nProfessional services gross margin, or professional services revenue less cost of professional services revenue expressed as a percentage of professional services revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our professional services organization. The primary focus of our professional services business will continue to be providing high-quality customer deployments that allow customers to realize rapid value from our solutions and become long-term, loyal customers. In the future, we may choose to invest in our professional services organization at a pace faster than professional services revenue growth, in which case we may experience a decline in professional services gross margin. We also expect professional services gross margin to be positively affected in periods, particularly the fourth quarter, in which we recognize revenue related to TBM Council events. We expect professional services gross margin to remain relatively consistent over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nWe expect total gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term as our subscription revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue, as we realize operational efficiencies in our data centers and public cloud hosting environments, and as we continue to leverage our partners to help us provide professional services, although total gross margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with product development, hosting costs and depreciation of equipment used in research and development, consulting fees, and allocated overhead costs. For development costs related to our software and internal use software, qualifying internally developed software costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the functionality and otherwise enhance our platform and develop new applications. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as our customer base and revenue grows, although research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs for lead generation, the costs associated with TBM Council events and allocated overhead costs. We immediately expense sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and subsequent renewals from existing customers. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our largest component of operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our direct sales teams, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total\nrevenue over the long-term, although sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, including payroll, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow and incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including increased legal, audit and consulting fees. Although general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses, in the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total revenue; however, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income (Expense) and Other, Net. Interest income (expense) and other, net consists primarily of interest on our capital leases and debt, and fair value adjustments for our preferred stock warrant liability. Interest income is derived from our available-for-sale investments.\nForeign Exchange Loss. Foreign exchange loss consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency (U.S. dollars). As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this trend to continue.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we have expanded our international operations, we have incurred increased foreign tax expense, and we expect this trend to continue. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our business performance. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. We regularly review this liquidity measure because we believe free cash flow facilitates period-to-period comparisons of liquidity. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure because it measures the amount of cash we generate from our operations after our capital expenditures and reflects changes in working capital. We use free cash flow in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our liquidity, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our liquidity.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information reconciliations of free cash flow to the related GAAP financial measure, net cash used in operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view free cash flow in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measure.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash used in operating activities to free cash flow:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

In addition, data center fees increased by $0.3 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth, and allocated overhead expenses increased by $0.7 million. These increases were offset by decreased consulting fees of $0.6 million. Additionally, professional services personnel are, on occasion, utilized for services associated with general subscription support. As a result, we reallocate the related personnel costs from cost of professional services to cost of subscription. This cost allocation decreased by $0.5 million as the increased number of our subscription support personnel was sufficient to handle the support workload. In 2016, we began allocating the cost of hosting internal-use instances of our SaaS applications to the departments using them. This resulted in a reduction of $1.0 million in subscription cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have evaluated the cost of hosting internal-use instances for the year ended December 31, 2015 and prior years, and determined that the impact was immaterial for reclassification.\nThe overall increase in cost of professional services revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in outside services of $0.7 million, due to an increase in the use of third parties to supplement internal staff in providing implementation services in 2016, and a reduction of allocated costs to cost of subscription of $0.5 million for personnel costs related to the use of professional services personnel for general subscription support. In addition, cost of professional services in 2016 includes a $0.2 million allocation of the cost of hosting internal-use instances of our SaaS applications as discussed above. These increases were offset by a decrease in personnel-related costs consisting of employee compensation, benefits and travel costs of $0.4 million driven by a reduction in headcount due to a shift toward utilizing more third parties to provide implementation services.\nSubscription gross margin increased as a result of an increase in revenue from growth in our customer base, and expanded utilization of existing hosting infrastructure.\nProfessional services gross margin was flat primarily due to relatively stable effective hourly billing rates for projects delivered during the comparable periods. The effective hourly billing rate may vary period over period based on the composition of projects being delivered.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased primarily due to increased personnel-related costs of $4.2 million, consisting of increased employee compensation and benefits driven by headcount growth.

The increase in foreign exchange loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound Sterling, EURO and Australian dollar.\nProvision for income taxes\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (109\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (343\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in provision for income taxes was due to an increase in foreign taxes related to our growing foreign operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue increased in 2015 primarily due to the impact of new customer acquisition.

In addition, data center fees increased by $0.8 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth, consulting fees increased by $0.7 million as we enhanced our disaster recovery functionality in each of our data centers, and allocated overhead expenses increased by $0.7 million. Additionally, professional services personnel are, on occasion, utilized for services associated with general subscription support. As a result, we reallocate the related personnel costs from cost of professional services to cost of subscription. This cost allocation increased by $0.3 million due to growth in our customer base and an increase in the number of customers migrating to new versions of our applications. At December 31, 2015, we delivered our service from two data centers in the United States and four data centers internationally, compared to two data centers in the United States and one data center internationally at December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization expense also increased by $0.4 million as we expanded our hosting infrastructure to support our customer growth.\nCost of professional services revenue decreased slightly year-over-year due to a decrease in outside services of $1.7 million, as a result of a reduction in our use of third parties to supplement internal staff in providing implementation services in 2015, offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $1.7 million, driven by headcount growth, consisting of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel costs of $1.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $0.2 million.\nSubscription gross margin decreased as a result of an increase in the number of data centers employed in anticipation of increased capacity requirements from customer base growth. These capacity increases occur in advance of generating significant revenue from new customers. Additionally, we increased the use of consulting services in 2015 to assist with the enhancement of disaster recovery functionality in each of our data centers.\nProfessional services gross margin improved as a result of changes in the way we deploy our applications to our customers, product enhancements that allow deployments to be more efficient, and increased customer adoption of our standardized cost model, ATUM.\nTotal headcount associated with cost of revenue increased 12% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 as we invested in additional resources to continue to support our solutions and further develop our professional services group.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased primarily due to increased personnel-related costs of $5.7 million, consisting of increased employee compensation and benefits costs of $4.9 million and an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.8 million.

This increase consists of increased employee compensation, benefits and increased travel costs of $7.6 million attributable to the increase in headcount and commission expense from increased sales, and additional stock-based compensation of $0.5 million. Marketing and event costs increased by $1.2 million due to our continued efforts to generate sales leads and build brand awareness, and allocated overhead costs increased by $1.2 million as a result of higher building rent and additional IT resources.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a 27% increase in headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.

We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Fourth quarter professional services revenue is also typically positively impacted by recognition of TBM Council conference registration and sponsorship fees.\nSales and marketing expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to commissions on the increase in customer agreements we typically see in that quarter, as well as increased expenses associated with the TBM Council conference.\nFurthermore, we usually enter into a significant portion of agreements with customers during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally one to three years. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of future sales activity or performance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $117.2 million of cash and investments, and $15.0 million in available borrowings under our credit facilities. Historically, we funded our operations principally through sales of equity securities, sales of subscriptions and professional services, or the incurrence of debt. On September 28, 2016, we closed our IPO of 6,900,000 shares of Class A common stock at an initial price to the public of $16.00 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $99.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In 2016, our principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Over\nthe past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nWe believe that existing cash and investments, any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nFrom time to time, we may explore additional financing sources and means to lower our cost of capital, which could include equity, equity-linked and debt financing. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nCredit Facilities\nIn June 2015, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, or the senior credit facility, to allow for the incurrence of up to $10.0 million in term loan borrowings and up to $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolver borrowings. In January 2016, we drew the $10.0 million principal amount of term borrowings under the senior credit facility. In April 2016, the senior credit facility was amended and we entered into a new subordinated loan and security agreement, which provided for an additional $20.0 million of term loan borrowings. Upon closing, we drew $10.0 million in term loan borrowings under the subordinated loan and security agreement. Using the proceeds from the IPO, on September 28, 2016, we repaid the $10.0 million principal amount of term borrowings under the senior credit facility (which are no longer available to be reborrowed) and the $10.0 million principal amount of term borrowings under the subordinated loan and security agreement. In addition, we paid a debt prepayment penalty and a final payment fee in the aggregate amount of $0.2 million in connection with the foregoing repayment and extinguishment of the subordinated loan and security agreement. Following such repayments, we continue to have available $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of revolver borrowings under the senior credit facility.\nThe senior credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur encumbrances, make distributions to holders of our capital stock, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates. If cash, cash equivalents and investments held with the lender are below $25 million as of the last day of the applicable monthly measuring period, we will be required to comply with a financial covenant based on subscription and professional services performance. This financial covenant is measured both monthly and quarterly, generally on a trailing six month basis. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2016. Our obligations under the senior credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,994\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,591\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,957\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74,644\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, change in fair value of preferred stock warrant liability, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges.\nNet cash used in operating activities during 2016 reflected our net loss of $31.6 million, offset by non-cash expenses that included $10.5 million of stock-based compensation, $6.0 million of depreciation and amortization, and $0.7 million of loss on extinguishment of debt. Working capital sources of cash included a $16.9 million increase in deferred revenue and a $2.0 million net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent. These sources of cash were offset by an increase of $5.8 million in accounts receivable, primarily due to increased billings to customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, and $3.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nNet cash used in operating activities during 2015 primarily reflected our net loss of $41.0 million, offset by non-cash expenses that included $7.8 million of stock-based compensation and $6.5 million of depreciation and amortization. Working capital sources of cash included a $19.9 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period, and a $3.1 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent. These sources of cash were offset by a $6.2 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, and a $1.0 million increase in prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities during 2014 primarily reflected our net loss of $32.9 million, offset by non-cash expenses that included $5.8 million in stock-based compensation and $5.2 million of depreciation and amortization. Working capital sources of cash included a $17.0 million increase in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period and a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent. These sources of cash were offset by a $15.2 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business and a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, property and equipment purchases for computer-related equipment, leasehold improvements to leased office facilities and capitalization of software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are related to new applications or improvements to our existing software platform that expands the functionality for customers.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of $75.3 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities, and $5.4 million of purchased property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, offset by $6.2 million of cash maturities from available-for-sale securities.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during 2015 was $6.7 million, consisting primarily of $16.8 million of cash maturities from available-for-sale securities, offset by $7.6 million of purchased property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, and $2.7 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during 2014 was $0.5 million, consisting primarily of $28.4 million of cash maturities from available-for-sale securities. These sources of cash were partially offset by $20.7 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and $6.3 million of purchased property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from our IPO and debt borrowings to fund operations and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the exercise of options. Cash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of repayment of debt borrowings, payment of IPO costs, loan fees and repayment of capital leases.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2016 consisted primarily of $102.7 million of IPO proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, $20.0 million in principal proceeds from term loan borrowings and $1.3 million from proceeds received from option exercises, offset by the repayment of $20.0 million in principal payments on term loan borrowings, and payment of IPO costs and loan fees of $2.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2015 consisted primarily of $2.7 million of proceeds received from option exercises, offset by the payment of IPO costs of $1.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was $1.4 million, consisting primarily of proceeds received from option exercises.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, our principal obligations consisted of obligations under non-cancellable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2023. Purchase obligations include certain other non-cancellable agreements for software and marketing services that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that are cancellable or with remaining terms of 12 months or less are not included.\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 -5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes interest totaling $4,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nAs an emerging growth company,\u201d or EGC, the Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act, or JOBS Act, allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> stock-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> income taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> capitalized internal use software.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the service has been provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSigned agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a signed contract by the customer does not exist, we have historically used either a purchase order or a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and either a purchase order or signed order form exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement.\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each subscription term, which is generally the date we make the subscribed applications available to customers. Once the subscribed application is available to customers, amounts that we have the contractual right to invoice are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. Professional services are priced either on a fixed-fee or a time-and-materials basis. Professional services revenue is recognized as the services are delivered. In instances where final acceptance of non-standard service deliverables are required before revenue is recognized, revenue and the associated costs are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.\nWe assess collectability based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectability is not reasonably assured, we defer the revenue recognition until collectability becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements do not include general rights of return.\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers utilizing our applications, fees for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees, which we refer to as premium support offerings, and fees for subscription based online training offerings; and (2) professional services, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our applications, as well as fees for in-person training and TBM Council conference registration and sponsorship fees. Implementation and configuration services primarily consist of consultative services, such as data mapping and establishing best practices. Implementation and configuration services do not result in any significant customization or modification of the software platform or user interface. We present revenue from each of these sources separately in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that primarily include subscription and professional services, but may also include premium support, online training and in-person training. The professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. We believe subscription offerings and professional service offerings have stand-alone value. Subscriptions have stand-alone value because such services\nare often sold separately from other professional services. Professional services have stand-alone value because those services may be sold separately by other vendors and there are trained third-party consultants capable of performing the professional services. Deliverables that are accounted for separately consist of software subscription, professional services, premium support and online or in-person training.\nWhen arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement based upon its relative selling price. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy in order of priority: vender specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE of selling price, nor TPE of selling price is available.\nWe determine VSOE of selling price based on historical stand-alone sales to customers. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for our subscription or professional services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range of the applicable median selling price. We have not yet been able to establish VSOE for our subscription and professional services because we have not historically priced our service offerings within a sufficiently narrow range. When VSOE cannot be established, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on third-party prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our pricing strategy differs from that of our peers and our services and solutions contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of other offerings with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, we use BESP as the selling price for our services.\nWe estimate BESP for subscriptions, premium support and online training based on the historical amounts for such deliverables on a stand-alone basis. The BESP for professional services is based on the historical average rate per hour charged, and BESP for in-person training is based on historical amounts on a per-seat basis.\nWe recognize revenue for subscription fees from customers utilizing our applications ratably over the subscription term, which are typically one-to three-years. Our subscription arrangements generally do not allow the customer the contractual right to take possession of the software; as such, the arrangements are considered to be service contracts. In those limited situations where the customer takes possession of the software, we follow the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 985, Software Revenue Recognition. Fees for premium support offerings and subscription-based online training are generally one-year agreements billed upfront, and are recognized ratably over the term of the support or training agreement. Our premium support offerings include all of our standard incident support services, with enhanced response times, dedicated support resources, access to architecture and configuration experts and other services not included with standard support. Our subscription-based online training provides self-directed training for customers via access to recorded training sessions.\nProfessional services revenue consists of fees associated with application configuration, integration, change management, education and training services, and conference registration and sponsorship fees. Professional services engagements are priced either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. The duration of our professional services engagements varies based on the scope of services requested, but typically ranges between three and six months. For time-and-materials arrangements, we recognize revenue as hours are worked. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize professional services revenue as delivered using the percentage of completion, or POC method, measured on an hours incurred basis. Under the POC method of accounting, revenue and expenses are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual hours incurred and total estimated hours at the completion of the project. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the project. Estimates of both hours and costs to complete a project are reviewed periodically and the effect of any change in the estimated hours to complete a project is reflected as an adjustment to revenue in the period the change becomes known.\nIn the event current estimated costs to complete a project exceed the revenue allocated to the project, a loss equal to the amount of estimated excess costs will be recognized in the period the change becomes known. The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenue, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. Associated out-of-pocket travel expenses related to the delivery\nof professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer. Out-of-pocket expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue and cost of service expense as incurred.\nFees for in-person training are billed in advance of the training and are recognized in the period the training occurs. Conference registration and sponsorship fees are for TBM Council conferences and related TBM Council activities. Registration fees for TBM Council conferences are billed in advance of the conference and are recognized in the period the conference occurs. TBM Council sponsorship fees are paid in advance and are recognized in the period the sponsorship activities occur, or ratably over the contractual period if the sponsorship entails ongoing activities beyond a single event.\nOn occasion, we sell subscriptions through third-party resellers. These arrangements typically call for the reseller to retain a portion of the price to the customer as compensation. Since we are typically responsible for the acceptability of the services purchased by the customer, we are the primary obligor in the transaction and, therefore, record revenue on a gross-basis based on the amount billed to the customer. Reseller fees are recognized as sales and marketing expense as incurred.\nDeferred revenue represents the unearned revenue on cash receipts or accounts receivable for the sale of subscriptions and for professional services for which services have not yet been provided. The substantial majority of deferred revenue relates to subscription revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant, and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award based on the estimated portion of the award that is expected to vest.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock-based awards, other than restricted stock units, or RSUs, when they are granted. RSUs are valued based on the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant. We make several estimates in determining stock-based compensation and these estimates generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO in September 2016, our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to, (i) contemporaneous valuations performed by unrelated third-party valuation firms, (ii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock, (iii) the lack of marketability of our common stock, (iv) our stage of development; and (v) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of our business given prevailing market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO we use the market-closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term of equity awards represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We estimate the expected term using the simplified method due to the lack of historical exercise activity for our company. The expected term for Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares is equivalent to the offering period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available at the time of the equity grant in U.S. Treasury securities at maturity with a term equivalent to the expected term of the equity award.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. Expected volatility is based on an average volatility of stock prices for a group of publicly traded peer companies, as we do not have sufficient historical trading experience for our common stock to cover the expected term of awards. In considering peer companies, we assess characteristics such as industry, state of development, size and financial leverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf any assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for awards. Our forfeiture rate is derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from these estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense will be required.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the U.S. and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be realized from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is not more likely than not all or some of a deferred tax asset will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, our history of earnings and reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities may examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.\nCapitalized Internal Use Software\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of computer software for internal use. These costs generally relate to the development of our technology platform and applications. We capitalize these costs during the development of the project, when it is determined that it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post-implementation activities, training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over our estimated useful life, generally three years, and the amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of subscriptions for projects associated with delivery of our technology platform and applications, or through operating expenses for projects associated with internal operations. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-18 is required for annual reporting periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2018, which represents the delayed adoption date applicable to private companies available to us pursuant to the Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act, or the JOBS Act, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this new standard retrospectively in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in the removal of the change in restricted cash within investing activities and the inclusion of the amount of restricted cash in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), related to the disclosures around going concern. The new standard provides guidance around management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new standard is effective for all entities for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this new standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 is intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows and to eliminate the diversity in practice related to such classifications. The guidance in ASU 2016-15 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, which represents the delayed adoption date applicable to private companies available to us pursuant to the JOBS Act, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard retrospectively in the third quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in the classification of $0.2 million of debt prepayment fees incurred on the early extinguishment of debt within financing activities rather than operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows for year ended December 31, 2016. There was no impact on any prior periods.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest, requiring entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a reduction of the carrying amount of the liability. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, to provide additional guidance pertaining to debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The new standard provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new standard does not change the accounting for a customer's accounting for service contracts. The new standard is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. For all other entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Inter-Entity Transfers of Assets other than Inventory. The guidance requires entities to recognize the income tax impact of an intra-entity sale or transfer of an asset other than inventory when the sale or transfer occurs, rather than when the assets has been sold to an outside party. The guidance will require a modified retrospective application with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, but permits adoption in an earlier period. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The objective of the update is to improve financial reporting by increasing transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. For public entities, the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities, the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application of the amendments is permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, this guidance expands related disclosure requirements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective date, which delayed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year and is allowing earlier adoption; however, entities reporting under GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date for public entities. For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. For all other entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The new standard will require full or modified retrospective application. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarifies the implementation guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition. Based on a preliminary assessment, we anticipate this standard will not have a material impact on subscription or services revenue recognition in our consolidated financial statements. However, the adoption of the standard will require us to capitalize certain contract costs, such as commissions, which are currently being expensed as incurred and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers, and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. We are continuing to assess the impact of adoption, which may identify other impacts on our consolidated financial statements, as well as the expected adoption method and timing.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition, focusing on its business model, recent developments, key factors affecting performance, and components of its results of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the leading provider of Technology Business Management, or TBM, solutions. Our cloud-based platform and SaaS applications enable IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. We empower IT leaders to transform IT into a service provider, navigate the cloud transition, and shift technology resources to drive more business innovation.\nWe were founded in 2007 to deliver cloud-based TBM solutions to global enterprises. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our first TBM application via our extensible platform in 2008. Since then, we have continued to invest in product innovation and have consistently introduced new applications and capabilities to the market.\nBecause we offer our applications on a subscription basis, typically on contracts with one- to three-year terms, we have visibility into a substantial portion of future revenue. Subscription fees are based on two primary factors: (1) the customer's annual costs being managed by the applications; and (2) the applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed. For some applications, pricing is also impacted by the number of users. We recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a significant portion of subscription revenue from subscriptions to our Cost Transparency application. We sell our offerings primarily through a direct sales force and we engage in a variety of marketing activities, including traditional and online activities as well as participation in, and support of, the TBM Council, which are designed to provide sales lead generation, sales support and market awareness. Customers may subscribe for one or more of our applications, and within those applications they may choose to subscribe for all or a portion of the respective application's capabilities, which are segmented into modules. For those customers that do not initially implement all of our applications, we seek to sell additional applications and modules over time. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the number of applications deployed by existing customers. We also derive revenue from professional services. Professional services revenue includes revenue from application configuration, integration, change management, education and training services, and conference registration and sponsorship fees. This revenue is largely driven by the number and mix of implementations that we perform in a quarter.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue in North America; however, we are focused on growing our international business. Revenue generated from customers outside of North America accounted for 25%, 22% and 19% of total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information regarding revenue generated from each geographic segment, please see Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have grown significantly in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes companies across industries and sizes, and our direct sales force has historically targeted organizations with annual IT spend of $100 million or more. Beginning in 2014, we expanded the focus of our sales force to include a broader set of target customers, often referred to as the Global 10,000, which includes many companies with annual IT spend of less than $100 million. We expect these customers will account for an increasing amount of our revenue over time. A substantial majority of our revenue growth has come from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenue and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to drive continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to employee growth. We had 731 and 636 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the average annual subscription contract value from all active customers was approximately $400,000. Average annual subscription contract value has been affected by the fact that, prior to 2014, our sales force focused on selling our entire technology platform to customers, generally with very large IT\nspend, which resulted in fewer, but larger, deals as compared to today. Add-on sales to existing customers were not a primary focus. Beginning in 2014, our sales force began to focus on selling discrete applications rather than our entire platform to a broader range of customers in the Global 10,000. Under this approach, we often sell one or two applications initially and subsequently target sales opportunities for additional applications. As a result, although some period-to-period variability may be introduced with one or more large contracts, we expect average annual contract value of newly acquired customers to decrease for the foreseeable future.\nWe had total revenue of $160.6 million, $129.3 million and $106.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 24% and 21%. Subscription revenue was $130.1 million, $99.9 million and $78.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 30% and 27%. We incurred net losses of $31.6 million, $41.0 million and $32.9 million, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $200.3 million as of December 31, 2016. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a substantial positive return on these investments by retaining customers, increasing the number of applications and modules deployed by customers over time, and increasing the spend managed by our applications. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur significant upfront costs, including sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, which are expensed upfront, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, which commences when all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur objective is for each customer relationship to be profitable over its lifetime, however, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions, purchase additional applications and expand their IT spend managed by our applications. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. Our sales and marketing expense for renewals and additional sales to existing customers are significantly less than those for sales to new customers while the cost of revenue remains relatively constant. As a result, we believe the mix shift over time between new and existing customers will have a positive impact on our operating margins. Specifically, as the percentage of our annual revenue from existing customers grows relative to the annual revenue from new customers, we would expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, in which we sold 6,900,000 shares of our Class A common stock at the initial price to public of $16.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $99.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nNet Subscription Dollar Retention Rate\nWe believe that our net subscription dollar retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and increase revenue from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. Accordingly, we compare the aggregate annual contract value of our customer base at the end of the prior 12 month period, which we refer to as the base annual contract value, to the aggregate annual contract value from the same group of customers at the end of the current 12 month period, which we refer to as the retained annual contract value. We calculate our net subscription dollar retention rate on a trailing 12 month basis by dividing the retained annual contract value by the base annual contract value. In the event a customer renews a subscription for a period that begins and ends in the same 12 month period, the value of that partial-year subscription is included in our calculation of retained annual contract value. Our net subscription dollar retention rate was approximately 98% and 100% for each of the 12 month periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our offerings globally. In addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers' evolving needs. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. However, we expect research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as revenue grows, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale as our customer base grows.\nSince our inception, we have invested in professional services to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe that our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Apptio, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenue. In addition, over the long-term, we expect professional services revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our customer base continues to grow and as the effort required to deploy our solutions decreases, through product enhancements and our efforts to drive increased customer adoption of our standardized IT operating model, the Apptio TBM Unified Model, or ATUM.\nInvestment in Infrastructure\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in infrastructure that will impact cost of revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We intend to invest to support growth at our leased data centers and with public cloud infrastructure providers to deliver enhanced levels of service to our customers. We intend to continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud architecture, which are designed to provide our customers with enhanced security, scalability and availability. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our data center locations to address additional geographic markets. In addition, we may expand existing and establish new facilities in the future to accommodate our projected headcount growth at various locations around the world. We may incur substantial costs in connection with such expansion efforts, including leasehold improvements, equipment costs, and, if headcount increases faster than we expect, potentially lease termination payments to enter into new leases for larger space.\nSales Cycles\nWe target sales efforts at enterprises and face long sales cycles, complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, and a relatively low and difficult to predict volume of sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This makes it difficult to predict with certainty our sales and related operating performance in any given period. Our typical sales cycle is approximately six months, but can be highly variable. Historically we have experienced an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks of the quarter which can affect the timing of recognized revenue and the possibility that sales cycles extend beyond the end of a quarter. Extending sales cycles beyond the end of a quarter, particularly for sizeable transactions, can harm forecasting accuracy and impact billings and new customer acquisition metrics for the quarter in which they are forecasted to close.\nMeeting our financial plan in part depends on a predictable growth rate in the acquisition of new customers that represent high annual contract value, while additional growth and enhanced predictability in part depends on an increased volume of new customers with a relatively lower annual contract value. Our financial performance and the predictability of our quarterly financial results may be harmed by intermittent failures to secure the higher value enterprise agreements, or increase the volume of transactions overall, according to our forecasts, and depends in large part on the successful execution of our direct sales team.\nFocus on Free Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure that we are focused on to run our business. For a reconciliation\nof free cash flow to the related U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP measure, net cash used in operating activities, see the section captioned Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our platform, fees for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees, and fees for subscription-based online training; and (2) professional services, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our applications, as well as fees for in-person training and conference registration and sponsorship fees for the TBM Council, the operations of which we consolidate in our financial statements given the nature of our relationship.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the acquisition of new customers and renewals by existing customers, the amount of annual spend our customers are licensed to manage with our applications and the number of applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed.\nOur contracts typically vary in length between one and three years. All subscription and support fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription and support-based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. As a result, most of the revenue that we report in each period is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Pricing includes multiple environments, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription period. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, but contract lengths and billing frequencies may vary. Therefore, the annualized value of the arrangements that we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.\nA typical new customer implementation takes three to six months depending on the customer's complexity and timeliness. All professional services fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Our professional services engagements are priced on either a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. In addition, sometimes partners will perform implementation services directly to our customers for which we do not receive professional services revenue. For time-and-materials arrangements, we recognize revenue as hours are worked at the stated hourly rate. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method measured on an hours incurred basis. Professional services yield lower gross margins than subscriptions due to the labor-intensive nature of professional services.\nOn occasion, we sell our applications through third-party resellers. These arrangements typically call for the reseller to retain a portion of the subscription fee paid by the customer as compensation. Since we are typically responsible for the acceptability of the services purchased by the customer, we are the primary obligor in the transaction and, therefore, record revenue on a gross basis based on the amount billed to the customer. Reseller fees are recognized as sales and marketing expense as incurred.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our technology operations and customer support teams, fees paid to our managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which include rent, facilities and costs related to internal IT. We expect cost of subscription revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nSubscription gross margin, or subscription revenue less cost of subscription revenue expressed as a percentage of subscription revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of the fees that we pay to our hosting providers and other third- party service providers, and the timing and extent of the investments that we make in additional data center infrastructure and capabilities. Due to investments we made in additional data centers and public cloud hosting capabilities prior to December 31, 2015, we expect subscription gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above. Because we have data centers in each of our three primary geographies, we expect to be able to more efficiently add capacity within these data centers to support our anticipated customer growth.\nCost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, employee benefits, travel expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, as well as allocated overhead costs. Cost of professional services excludes costs associated with TBM Council conferences, which we record as sales and marketing expenses. We expect cost of professional services revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we further expand our professional services organization to serve our growing customer base.\nProfessional services gross margin, or professional services revenue less cost of professional services revenue expressed as a percentage of professional services revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our professional services organization. The primary focus of our professional services business will continue to be providing high-quality customer deployments that allow customers to realize rapid value from our solutions and become long-term, loyal customers. In the future, we may choose to invest in our professional services organization at a pace faster than professional services revenue growth, in which case we may experience a decline in professional services gross margin. We also expect professional services gross margin to be positively affected in periods, particularly the fourth quarter, in which we recognize revenue related to TBM Council events. We expect professional services gross margin to remain relatively consistent over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nWe expect total gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term as our subscription revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue, as we realize operational efficiencies in our data centers and public cloud hosting environments, and as we continue to leverage our partners to help us provide professional services, although total gross margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with product development, hosting costs and depreciation of equipment used in research and development, consulting fees, and allocated overhead costs. For development costs related to our software and internal use software, qualifying internally developed software costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the functionality and otherwise enhance our platform and develop new applications. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as our customer base and revenue grows, although research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs for lead generation, the costs associated with TBM Council events and allocated overhead costs. We immediately expense sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and subsequent renewals from existing customers. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our largest component of operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our direct sales teams, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total\nrevenue over the long-term, although sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, including payroll, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow and incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including increased legal, audit and consulting fees. Although general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses, in the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total revenue; however, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income (Expense) and Other, Net. Interest income (expense) and other, net consists primarily of interest on our capital leases and debt, and fair value adjustments for our preferred stock warrant liability. Interest income is derived from our available-for-sale investments.\nForeign Exchange Loss. Foreign exchange loss consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency (U.S. dollars). As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this trend to continue.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we have expanded our international operations, we have incurred increased foreign tax expense, and we expect this trend to continue. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our business performance. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. We regularly review this liquidity measure because we believe free cash flow facilitates period-to-period comparisons of liquidity. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure because it measures the amount of cash we generate from our operations after our capital expenditures and reflects changes in working capital. We use free cash flow in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our liquidity, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our liquidity.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information reconciliations of free cash flow to the related GAAP financial measure, net cash used in operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view free cash flow in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measure.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash used in operating activities to free cash flow:\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with the financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of this report captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are the leading provider of Technology Business Management, or TBM, solutions. Our cloud-based platform and SaaS applications enable IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers. We empower IT leaders to transform IT into a service provider, navigate the cloud transition, and shift technology resources to drive more business innovation.\nWe were founded in 2007 to deliver cloud-based TBM solutions to global enterprises. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our first TBM application via our extensible platform in 2008. Since then, we have continued to invest in product innovation and have consistently introduced new applications and capabilities to the market.\nBecause we offer our applications on a subscription basis, typically on contracts with one- to three-year terms, we have visibility into a substantial portion of future revenue. Subscription fees are based on two primary factors: (1) the customer's annual costs being managed by the applications; and (2) the applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed. For some applications, pricing is also impacted by the number of users. We recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a significant portion of subscription revenue from subscriptions to our Cost Transparency application. We sell our offerings primarily through a direct sales force and we engage in a variety of marketing activities, including traditional and online activities as well as participation in, and support of, the TBM Council, which are designed to provide sales lead generation, sales support and market awareness. Customers may subscribe for one or more of our applications, and within those applications they may choose to subscribe for all or a portion of the respective application's capabilities, which are segmented into modules. For those customers that do not initially implement all of our applications, we seek to sell additional applications and modules over time. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the number of applications deployed by existing customers. We also derive revenue from professional services. Professional services revenue includes revenue from application configuration, integration, change management, education and training services, and conference registration and sponsorship fees. This revenue is largely driven by the number and mix of implementations that we perform in a quarter.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue in North America; however, we are focused on growing our international business. Revenue generated from customers outside of North America accounted for 25%, 22% and 19% of total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information regarding revenue generated from each geographic segment, please see Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have grown significantly in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes companies across industries and sizes, and our direct sales force has historically targeted organizations with annual IT spend of $100 million or more. Beginning in 2014, we expanded the focus of our sales force to include a broader set of target customers, often referred to as the Global 10,000, which includes many companies with annual IT spend of less than $100 million. We expect these customers will account for an increasing amount of our revenue over time. A substantial majority of our revenue growth has come from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenue and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to drive continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to employee growth. We had 731 and 636 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the average annual subscription contract value from all active customers was approximately $400,000. Average annual subscription contract value has been affected by the fact that, prior to 2014, our sales force focused on selling our entire technology platform to customers, generally with very large IT\nspend, which resulted in fewer, but larger, deals as compared to today. Add-on sales to existing customers were not a primary focus. Beginning in 2014, our sales force began to focus on selling discrete applications rather than our entire platform to a broader range of customers in the Global 10,000. Under this approach, we often sell one or two applications initially and subsequently target sales opportunities for additional applications. As a result, although some period-to-period variability may be introduced with one or more large contracts, we expect average annual contract value of newly acquired customers to decrease for the foreseeable future.\nWe had total revenue of $160.6 million, $129.3 million and $106.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 24% and 21%. Subscription revenue was $130.1 million, $99.9 million and $78.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 30% and 27%. We incurred net losses of $31.6 million, $41.0 million and $32.9 million, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $200.3 million as of December 31, 2016. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a substantial positive return on these investments by retaining customers, increasing the number of applications and modules deployed by customers over time, and increasing the spend managed by our applications. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur significant upfront costs, including sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, which are expensed upfront, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period, which commences when all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur objective is for each customer relationship to be profitable over its lifetime, however, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions, purchase additional applications and expand their IT spend managed by our applications. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. Our sales and marketing expense for renewals and additional sales to existing customers are significantly less than those for sales to new customers while the cost of revenue remains relatively constant. As a result, we believe the mix shift over time between new and existing customers will have a positive impact on our operating margins. Specifically, as the percentage of our annual revenue from existing customers grows relative to the annual revenue from new customers, we would expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, in which we sold 6,900,000 shares of our Class A common stock at the initial price to public of $16.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $99.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nNet Subscription Dollar Retention Rate\nWe believe that our net subscription dollar retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and increase revenue from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. Accordingly, we compare the aggregate annual contract value of our customer base at the end of the prior 12 month period, which we refer to as the base annual contract value, to the aggregate annual contract value from the same group of customers at the end of the current 12 month period, which we refer to as the retained annual contract value. We calculate our net subscription dollar retention rate on a trailing 12 month basis by dividing the retained annual contract value by the base annual contract value. In the event a customer renews a subscription for a period that begins and ends in the same 12 month period, the value of that partial-year subscription is included in our calculation of retained annual contract value. Our net subscription dollar retention rate was approximately 98% and 100% for each of the 12 month periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our offerings globally. In addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers' evolving needs. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. However, we expect research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as revenue grows, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale as our customer base grows.\nSince our inception, we have invested in professional services to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe that our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Apptio, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenue. In addition, over the long-term, we expect professional services revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our customer base continues to grow and as the effort required to deploy our solutions decreases, through product enhancements and our efforts to drive increased customer adoption of our standardized IT operating model, the Apptio TBM Unified Model, or ATUM.\nInvestment in Infrastructure\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in infrastructure that will impact cost of revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We intend to invest to support growth at our leased data centers and with public cloud infrastructure providers to deliver enhanced levels of service to our customers. We intend to continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud architecture, which are designed to provide our customers with enhanced security, scalability and availability. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our data center locations to address additional geographic markets. In addition, we may expand existing and establish new facilities in the future to accommodate our projected headcount growth at various locations around the world. We may incur substantial costs in connection with such expansion efforts, including leasehold improvements, equipment costs, and, if headcount increases faster than we expect, potentially lease termination payments to enter into new leases for larger space.\nSales Cycles\nWe target sales efforts at enterprises and face long sales cycles, complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, and a relatively low and difficult to predict volume of sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This makes it difficult to predict with certainty our sales and related operating performance in any given period. Our typical sales cycle is approximately six months, but can be highly variable. Historically we have experienced an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks of the quarter which can affect the timing of recognized revenue and the possibility that sales cycles extend beyond the end of a quarter. Extending sales cycles beyond the end of a quarter, particularly for sizeable transactions, can harm forecasting accuracy and impact billings and new customer acquisition metrics for the quarter in which they are forecasted to close.\nMeeting our financial plan in part depends on a predictable growth rate in the acquisition of new customers that represent high annual contract value, while additional growth and enhanced predictability in part depends on an increased volume of new customers with a relatively lower annual contract value. Our financial performance and the predictability of our quarterly financial results may be harmed by intermittent failures to secure the higher value enterprise agreements, or increase the volume of transactions overall, according to our forecasts, and depends in large part on the successful execution of our direct sales team.\nFocus on Free Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure that we are focused on to run our business. For a reconciliation\nof free cash flow to the related U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP measure, net cash used in operating activities, see the section captioned Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from two sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our platform, fees for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees, and fees for subscription-based online training; and (2) professional services, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our applications, as well as fees for in-person training and conference registration and sponsorship fees for the TBM Council, the operations of which we consolidate in our financial statements given the nature of our relationship.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the acquisition of new customers and renewals by existing customers, the amount of annual spend our customers are licensed to manage with our applications and the number of applications or capabilities for which the customer has subscribed.\nOur contracts typically vary in length between one and three years. All subscription and support fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription and support-based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. As a result, most of the revenue that we report in each period is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Pricing includes multiple environments, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription period. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, but contract lengths and billing frequencies may vary. Therefore, the annualized value of the arrangements that we enter into with our customers may not be fully reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that the change in deferred revenue for any period is an accurate indicator of future revenue for a given period of time. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.\nA typical new customer implementation takes three to six months depending on the customer's complexity and timeliness. All professional services fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Our professional services engagements are priced on either a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. In addition, sometimes partners will perform implementation services directly to our customers for which we do not receive professional services revenue. For time-and-materials arrangements, we recognize revenue as hours are worked at the stated hourly rate. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method measured on an hours incurred basis. Professional services yield lower gross margins than subscriptions due to the labor-intensive nature of professional services.\nOn occasion, we sell our applications through third-party resellers. These arrangements typically call for the reseller to retain a portion of the subscription fee paid by the customer as compensation. Since we are typically responsible for the acceptability of the services purchased by the customer, we are the primary obligor in the transaction and, therefore, record revenue on a gross basis based on the amount billed to the customer. Reseller fees are recognized as sales and marketing expense as incurred.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our technology operations and customer support teams, fees paid to our managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which include rent, facilities and costs related to internal IT. We expect cost of subscription revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nSubscription gross margin, or subscription revenue less cost of subscription revenue expressed as a percentage of subscription revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of the fees that we pay to our hosting providers and other third- party service providers, and the timing and extent of the investments that we make in additional data center infrastructure and capabilities. Due to investments we made in additional data centers and public cloud hosting capabilities prior to December 31, 2015, we expect subscription gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above. Because we have data centers in each of our three primary geographies, we expect to be able to more efficiently add capacity within these data centers to support our anticipated customer growth.\nCost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, employee benefits, travel expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, as well as allocated overhead costs. Cost of professional services excludes costs associated with TBM Council conferences, which we record as sales and marketing expenses. We expect cost of professional services revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we further expand our professional services organization to serve our growing customer base.\nProfessional services gross margin, or professional services revenue less cost of professional services revenue expressed as a percentage of professional services revenue, can and does fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our professional services organization. The primary focus of our professional services business will continue to be providing high-quality customer deployments that allow customers to realize rapid value from our solutions and become long-term, loyal customers. In the future, we may choose to invest in our professional services organization at a pace faster than professional services revenue growth, in which case we may experience a decline in professional services gross margin. We also expect professional services gross margin to be positively affected in periods, particularly the fourth quarter, in which we recognize revenue related to TBM Council events. We expect professional services gross margin to remain relatively consistent over the long-term, although it may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nWe expect total gross margin to increase modestly over the long-term as our subscription revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue, as we realize operational efficiencies in our data centers and public cloud hosting environments, and as we continue to leverage our partners to help us provide professional services, although total gross margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors discussed above.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with product development, hosting costs and depreciation of equipment used in research and development, consulting fees, and allocated overhead costs. For development costs related to our software and internal use software, qualifying internally developed software costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the functionality and otherwise enhance our platform and develop new applications. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as our customer base and revenue grows, although research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs for lead generation, the costs associated with TBM Council events and allocated overhead costs. We immediately expense sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and subsequent renewals from existing customers. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our largest component of operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our direct sales teams, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total\nrevenue over the long-term, although sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, including payroll, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow and incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including increased legal, audit and consulting fees. Although general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of revenue and the timing and extent of these expenses, in the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total revenue; however, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue over the long-term as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income (Expense) and Other, Net. Interest income (expense) and other, net consists primarily of interest on our capital leases and debt, and fair value adjustments for our preferred stock warrant liability. Interest income is derived from our available-for-sale investments.\nForeign Exchange Loss. Foreign exchange loss consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency (U.S. dollars). As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this trend to continue.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we have expanded our international operations, we have incurred increased foreign tax expense, and we expect this trend to continue. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our business performance. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. We regularly review this liquidity measure because we believe free cash flow facilitates period-to-period comparisons of liquidity. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure because it measures the amount of cash we generate from our operations after our capital expenditures and reflects changes in working capital. We use free cash flow in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our liquidity, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our liquidity.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information reconciliations of free cash flow to the related GAAP financial measure, net cash used in operating activities. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view free cash flow in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measure.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash used in operating activities to free cash flow:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
