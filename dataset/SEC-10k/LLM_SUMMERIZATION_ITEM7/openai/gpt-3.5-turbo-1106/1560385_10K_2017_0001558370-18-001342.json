This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. See note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\nOverview\nWe own controlling and non-controlling interests in a broad range of media and entertainment companies. Our most significant operating subsidiary, which is a reportable segment, is SIRIUS XM. SIRIUS XM provides a subscription based satellite radio service. SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems-the Sirius system and the XM system. Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus\nII-6\nfeatures such as SiriusXM On Demand, over SIRIUS XM's Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services, which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2017 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies, such as Time Warner, Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d), which is accounted for at fair market value and is included in corporate and other.\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nThe term Liberty SiriusXM Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Liberty SiriusXM Group is primarily comprised of Liberty's subsidiary, SIRIUS XM, corporate cash and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As of December 31, 2017, the Liberty SiriusXM Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $615 million, which includes $69 million of subsidiary cash.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and\nII-7\ntake appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. Also upon the Recapitalization, Liberty had attributed to the Braves Group all liabilities arising under a note from Braves Holdings to Liberty, with a total capacity of up to $165 million of borrowings by Braves Holdings (the Intergroup Note\u201d) relating to funds to be borrowed and used for investment in the Development Project. As discussed below, the Intergroup Note, including accrued interest, was repaid during June 2016 using proceeds from the subscription rights offering and the Intergroup Note agreement was cancelled. As of December 31, 2017, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $132 million, which includes $55 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group.\nFollowing the Recapitalization, Liberty issued subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock. In the rights distribution, Liberty distributed 0.47 of a Series C Liberty Braves subscription right for each share of Series A, Series B or Series C Liberty Braves common stock held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 16, 2016. Fractional Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights were rounded up to the nearest whole right. Each whole Series C Liberty Braves subscription right entitled the holder to purchase, pursuant to the basic subscription privilege, one share of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock at a subscription price of $12.80, which was equal to an approximate 20% discount to the trading day volume weighted average trading price of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock for the 18-day trading period ending on May 11, 2016. Each Series C Liberty Braves subscription right also entitled the holder to subscribe for additional shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock that were unsubscribed for in the rights offering pursuant to an oversubscription privilege. The rights offering commenced on May 18, 2016, which was also the ex-dividend date for the distribution of the Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights. The rights offering expired at 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on June 16, 2016 and was fully subscribed with 15,833,634 shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, if applicable, oversubscription privileges. Approximately $150 million of the proceeds from the rights offering were used to repay the outstanding balance on the Intergroup Note and accrued interest to Liberty. The remaining proceeds will be used for future development costs attributed to the Braves Group.\nThe term Formula One Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, a minority equity investment in Time Warner, the recovery received in connection with the Vivendi lawsuit and cash, as well as Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $202 million, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $282 million, which includes $165 million of subsidiary cash.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nSIRIUS XM.\u2003SIRIUS XM is focused on several initiatives to increase its revenue. SIRIUS XM regularly evaluates its business plans and strategy.

million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year.\nII-10\nThe 2016 increase was primarily driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $462 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nOperating income.\u2003Our consolidated operating income decreased $340 million and increased $780 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. Formula One Group operating income improved $524 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the Vivendi lawsuit settlement. In addition, Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $279 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the Braves Group operating loss which increased $23 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nStock-based compensation.\u2003Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nWe recorded $230 million, $150 million and $204 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nUpon acquisition of a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM, we recorded an adjustment to increase SIRIUS XM's unvested stock-based compensation to fair value and amortized this adjustment through December 31, 2015. SIRIUS XM stock-based compensation expense in 2015 included $73 million of this purchase price amortization expense. This caused a decrease in 2016 stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Company, which was partially offset by a $25 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recognized by SIRIUS XM during 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately $30 million. Such amount will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. As of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SIRIUS XM stock options and restricted stock units was $242 million. The SIRIUS XM unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nAdjusted OIBDA.\u2003We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the\nII-11\nmeasurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 million and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the $45 million and $46 million of expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties expense line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of the Company's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\nSIRIUS XM recognized approximately $43 million, $40 million and $127 million of Revenue share and royalties within the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the SIRIUS XM legal settlement associated with SIRIUS XM's use of certain pre-1972 sound recordings. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million, $40 million and $19 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $720 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $442 million, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2016 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $178 million, partially offset by declines in Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $23 million and Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $10 million.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more

The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1.

The improvement in Live Nation's net income during 2016 was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of its senior secured credit facility during 2016. Accordingly, the Company relieved a portion of the underlying difference in the equity of Live Nation related to the debt extinguished during 2016.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments.\u2003Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFair Value Option Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(36)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(151)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt measured at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(126)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(113)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of bond hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe losses on Fair Value Option Securities (as defined in note 3 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements) during 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to general decreases in market valuation adjustments during the respective years. The gain on Fair Value Option Securities during 2016 is primarily due to a general increase in market valuation adjustments during the year.\nChanges in unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable.\nLiberty issued $1 billion of cash convertible notes in October 2013 which are accounted for at fair value, as elected by Liberty at the time of issuance of the notes. At the same time, Liberty entered into a bond hedge transaction on the same amount of underlying shares. These derivatives are marked to fair value on a recurring basis. The primary driver of the change in the fair value of bond hedges in 2017 as compared to the prior year is the change in the fair value of the underlying stock.\nII-14\nOther, net.\u2003The gain in 2017 was primarily due to a $19 million increase in interest and dividend income and a $12 million increase in gains on transactions, partially offset by a $24 million increase in losses on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the redemption of certain debt at SIRIUS XM. The loss in 2016 was primarily due to a $24 million loss on extinguishment of SIRIUS XM's redemption of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 during the year, partially offset by approximately $18 million in dividend and interest income, primarily due to dividends on Time Warner shares. The gain in 2015 was primarily due to $17 million in dividend and interest income, primarily due to dividends on Time Warner shares, partially offset by losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment.\nIncome taxes.\u2003Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was a benefit of 129% and expense of 35% and 46%, respectively.

As a result, SIRIUS XM expects it will reduce its future taxes and use less of certain net operating losses in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet earnings.\u2003We had net earnings of $1,890 million, $924 million and $248 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Additionally, the Company has a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM which has significant cash flows provided by operating activities, although due to SIRIUS XM being a separate public company and the significant noncontrolling interest, we do not have ready access to its cash. Cash held by Formula 1 is accessible by Liberty, except when certain restricted payment tests imposed by the Senior Loan Facility at Formula 1 are not met. As of December 31, 2017, Liberty had fully drawn on the line of credit portion of the $750 million margin loan due 2018 and had $150 million available under the Live Nation Margin Loan.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, SIRIUS XM declared a cash dividend each quarter, and has paid in cash an aggregate amount of $190 million, of which Liberty has received $130 million. SIRIUS XM's board of directors expects to declare regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of $0.044 per share of common stock. On January 23, 2018, SIRIUS XM's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.011 per share of common stock, payable on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2018.\nBraves Holdings incurred approximately $219 million of capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the construction of the Braves Holdings ballpark facility and adjacent mixed-use complex. Braves Holdings' capital expenditures were funded through the use of cash on hand and borrowings of debt.\nThe projected uses of Liberty cash (excluding SIRIUS XM's, Formula 1's and Braves Holdings' uses of cash) are primarily the investment in new or existing businesses, debt service, including repayment of the margin loans and the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program. Liberty expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash from operations and borrowing capacity under margin loans and outstanding credit facilities. We may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, Liberty has made investments of approximately $389 million in other available for sale securities using SiriusXM Group corporate cash.\nSIRIUS XM's uses of cash are expected to be operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, legal settlements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of outstanding debt. Liberty expects SIRIUS XM to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and borrowings under the existing credit facility.\nFormula 1's uses of cash are expected to be debt service payments, as well as continued investment in its business. Liberty expects Formula 1 to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and cash provided by operations.\nBraves Holdings' uses of cash are expected to be expenditures related to the mixed-use development and new spring training facility. Liberty expects Braves Holdings to fund its projected uses of cash with borrowings under its existing debt instruments. See Item 1. Business - (c) Narrative Description of Business - Braves Holdings, LLC - Facilities.\nWe believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nSIRIUS XM has entered into various programming agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, SIRIUS XM's obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. SIRIUS XM's future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in the schedule of contractual obligations below.\nThe Atlanta Braves have entered into long-term employment contracts with certain of their players and coaches whereby such individuals' compensation is guaranteed.

SIRIUS XM satellite and transmission commitments are attributable to agreements with third parties to operate and maintain the off-site satellite telemetry, tracking and control facilities and certain components of its terrestrial repeater networks. During the year ended December 31, 2016, SIRIUS XM entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral to design and build two satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, for SIRIUS XM's service. SIRIUS XM marketing and distribution commitments primarily relate to payments to sponsors, retailers, automakers and radio manufacturers pursuant to marketing, sponsorship and distribution agreements to promote the SIRIUS XM brand. Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. and Space Systems/Loral, the manufacturers of SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit satellite incentive performance payments based on the expected operating performance of the satellites meeting their fifteen-year design life. Boeing may also be entitled to an additional $10 million if the XM-4 satellite continues to operate above baseline specifications during the five years beyond the satellite's fifteen-year design life. Additionally, SIRIUS XM has entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting estimates and assumptions, as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements, have been discussed with our audit committee.\nNon-Financial Instruments.\u2003Our non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our determination of the estimated fair value allocation of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations, our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as\nII-18\ntrademarks, and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value. As each of our operating segments has long-lived assets, this critical accounting policy affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reporting units were as follows (amounts in millions):\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGoodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFCC Licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSIRIUS XM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets in the fourth quarter each year. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to simplify the measurement of goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, an entity no longer performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. Instead, a goodwill impairment is measured using the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company early adopted this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2017, with no impact to the consolidated financial statements.\nUseful Life of Broadcast/Transmission System.\u2003SIRIUS XM's satellite system includes the costs of satellite construction, launch vehicles, launch insurance, capitalized interest, spare satellites, terrestrial repeater network and satellite uplink facilities. SIRIUS XM monitors its satellites for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable.\nSIRIUS XM operates two in-orbit Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6. SIRIUS XM estimates that its FM-5 and FM-6 satellites, launched in 2009 and 2013, respectively, will operate effectively through the end of their depreciable lives in 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nSIRIUS XM operates three in-orbit XM satellites, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. SIRIUS XM estimates that its XM-3 and XM-4 satellites launched in 2005 and 2006, respectively, will reach the end of their depreciable lives in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The XM-5 satellite that was launched in 2010, is used as an in-orbit spare and is expected to reach the end of its depreciable life in 2025.\nII-19\nSIRIUS XM's satellites have been designed to last fifteen-years. SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites may experience component failures which could adversely affect their useful lives. SIRIUS XM monitors the operating condition of its in-orbit satellites. If events or circumstances indicate that the depreciable lives of its in-orbit satellites have changed, the depreciable life will be modified accordingly. If SIRIUS XM were to revise its estimates, depreciation expense would change. For example, a 10% decrease in the expected depreciable lives of satellites and spacecraft control facilities during 2017 would have resulted in approximately $21 million of additional depreciation expense.\nIncome Taxes.\u2003We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nResults of Operations-Businesses\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\nSIRIUS XM\u2003SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems. Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus features such as SiriusXM On Demand, over SIRIUS XM's Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nSIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs\u201d) to offer satellite radios in their vehicles through which it acquires the majority of its subscribers. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to SIRIUS XM's services. SIRIUS XM distributes its radios primarily through automakers, retailers and through its website. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies. SIRIUS XM's primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly basis. SIRIUS XM offers discounts for prepaid, longer term subscription plans, as well as multiple subscription discounts. SIRIUS XM also derives revenue from activation and other fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories and other ancillary services, such as weather, data and traffic services.\nAs of December 31, 2017, SIRIUS XM had approximately 32.7 million subscribers of which approximately 27.5 million were self-pay subscribers and approximately 5.2 million were paid promotional subscribers. These subscriber totals include subscribers under regular pricing plans; discounted pricing plans; subscribers that have prepaid, including payments either made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle; subscribers to SIRIUS XM Internet services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and certain subscribers to SIRIUS XM's weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions. Subscribers and subscription related revenue and expenses associated with the SIRIUS XM Canada service, which had approximately 2.8 million subscribers as of December 31, 2017, and SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services are not included in SIRIUS XM's subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM on January 18, 2013 and applied purchase accounting and consolidated the results of SIRIUS XM from that date. Prior to the acquisition of our controlling interest we maintained an investment in SIRIUS XM accounted for using the equity method. For comparison purposes we are presenting the stand\nII-20\nalone results of SIRIUS XM prior to any purchase accounting adjustments in the current year for a discussion of the operations of SIRIUS XM. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, see the reconciliation of the results reported by SIRIUS XM to the results reported by Liberty included below. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, there is an approximate 30% noncontrolling interest in SIRIUS XM, and the net earnings of SIRIUS XM attributable to such noncontrolling interest is eliminated through the noncontrolling interest line item in the consolidated statement of operations.

Subscriber revenue increased 7% and 10% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in the daily weighted average number of subscribers as well as increases in SIRIUS XM's average monthly revenue per subscriber resulting from certain rate increases.\nOther revenue includes advertising revenue, equipment revenue, royalty revenue and other ancillary revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other revenue increased 16% and 10%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The current year increase was driven by higher revenue from Sirius XM Canada due to the new Services Agreement and Advisory Services Agreement entered into in the second quarter of 2017, additional revenue from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services. The most significant change in other revenue during the prior year was an increase in revenue from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate. Furthermore, advertising revenue increased during both periods due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted along with increased rates charged per spot.\nEquipment revenue increased during the current year driven by royalty revenue on certain satellite radio components starting in the second quarter of 2016 due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets and revenue from the sales of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic, partially offset by lower revenue generated through satellite radio sales to distributors and consumers and lower OEM production. Equipment revenue increased during the prior year due to royalties from higher OEM production and an increase in royalty revenue on certain satellite radio components starting in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower revenue generated through satellite radio sales to distributors and consumers. Increases in other revenue during 2016 were offset by lower non-\nII-21\nrecurring engineering fees associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services, lower activation revenue from SIRIUS XM Canada and a change in accounting for a programming contract in the third quarter of 2015.\nCost of subscriber services includes revenue share and royalties, programming and content costs, customer service and billing expenses and other ancillary costs associated with providing the satellite radio service.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue Share and Royalties (excluding legal settlements) includes distribution and content provider revenue share, royalties for transmitting content and web streaming, and advertising revenue share. Revenue share and royalties increased 10% and 15% during 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increase during both years was primarily due to greater revenue subject to royalty and revenue sharing agreements and increases in the statutory royalty rate for the performance of sound recordings. During the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. These expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of the Company's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business. SIRIUS XM recognized $108 million during June 2015 for the portion of the $210 million Capitol Settlement related to SIRIUS XM's use of pre-1972 sound recordings for the periods prior to the Capitol Records lawsuit settlement during June 2015. The $108 million expense is included in the Revenue share and royalties line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 but has been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period as this expense was not incurred as a part of the Company's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount does not relate to the on-going performance of the business. During 2015, SIRIUS XM began recognizing pre-1972 sound recording royalty expenses in connection with the Capitol Records lawsuit settlement. Revenue share and royalties expense in the table above includes $43 million, $40 million and $19 million attributable to the recognition of pre-1972 sound recording royalty expenses during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProgramming and Content includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content.

The majority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of, or concurrent with, acquiring a subscriber. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, subscriber acquisition costs decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year decrease was driven by reductions to OEM hardware subsidy rates, lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets and a decrease in installations. The prior year decrease was driven by lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets and reductions to OEM hardware subsidy rates, partially offset by higher radio installations.\nOther operating expense includes engineering, design and development costs consisting primarily of compensation and related costs to develop chipsets and new products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other operating expense increased 41% and 25%, respectively. The current year increase was driven by the development of SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and additional costs associated with the development of SIRIUS XM's audio and video streaming products. The prior year increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of personnel related costs from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services that were previously recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015, partially offset by lower research and development costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative marketing; compensation and related personnel costs; facilities costs, finance, legal, human resources and information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 6% and 7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The current year increase was due to additional subscriber communications, retention programs and acquisition campaigns as well as higher personnel-related costs, partially offset by the timing of certain OEM marketing campaigns, lower legal costs, litigation reserves and consulting costs. The prior year increase was due to higher consulting and legal costs, additional subscriber communications, retention programs and acquisition campaigns related to SIRIUS XM's subscriber growth and higher personnel-related costs.\nStock-based compensation increased 14% and 30% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year is primarily due to an increase in the number of awards granted. The increase in stock-based compensation expense during 2016 is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation related to restricted stock units issued during 2015 and 2016 as well as an increase in the fair value of the awards granted since January 1, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 11% and decreased 1% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year was driven by the acceleration of amortization related to a shorter useful life of certain software as well as additional assets placed in-service. The decrease in the prior year was due to certain satellites reaching the end of their estimated service lives, partially offset by additional assets placed in service.\nII-23\nThe following tables

rights with respect to the World Championship, an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams compete for the Constructors' Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers' Championship. The World Championship takes place on various circuits with various Events. Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship as well as various aspects of its management and administration. Formula 1 derives the majority of its revenue from race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts.\nLiberty acquired a controlling interest in Formula 1 on January 23, 2017 and applied acquisition accounting and consolidated the results of Formula 1 from that date. Prior to the acquisition of our controlling interest, we maintained an investment in Formula 1 since September 7, 2016, which was accounted for as a cost method investment. Although Formula 1's results are only included in Liberty's results for the period from January 23, 2017 through December 31, 2017, we believe a discussion of Formula 1's results for all periods presented promotes a better understanding of the overall results of its business. For comparison and discussion purposes, we are presenting the pro forma results of Formula 1 for the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of acquisition accounting adjustments. The pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Formula 1 and assuming the acquisition of Formula 1 took place on January 1, 2016. The acquisition price allocation related to the Formula 1 business combination is preliminary. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments are based on this preliminary allocation and have been made solely for the purpose of providing comparative pro forma financial information. The financial information below is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent the actual results of operations of Formula 1 had the business combination occurred on January 1, 2016, or to project the results of operations of Liberty for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that Liberty management believes are reasonable. The pro forma adjustments are directly attributable to the business combination and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of Liberty.\nII-25\nFormula 1's pro forma operating results were as follows:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimary Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation included below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,256)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(125)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(90)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(451)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(403)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary Formula 1 revenue represents the majority of Formula 1's revenue and is derived from the following streams:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrace promotion fees earned from granting the rights to host, stage and promote each Event on the World Championship calendar;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nbroadcasting fees earned from licensing the right to broadcast Events on television and other platforms, including the internet; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nadvertising and sponsorship fees earned from the sale of World Championship and Event-related advertising and sponsorship rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPro forma Primary Formula 1 revenue decreased by $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease was due to one less Event during 2017 compared to 2016 and legacy contractual terms of one Event, which provided a one time significant decrease in race promotion fees after the 2016 season through the remaining term of that contract. These decreases in race promotion revenue were partially offset by the impact of other contractual increases. Broadcasting revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the net adverse impact of weaker prevailing foreign currency exchange rates used to translate a small number of fees that were not denominated in U.S Dollars into U.S. Dollars. Advertising and sponsorship revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to increased fees and growth in certain arrangements, partially offset by the non-renewal of two arrangements.\nOther Formula 1 revenue is generated from the operation of the Paddock Club at most Events, freight and related logistical and travel services, support races at Events (either from the direct operation of the and GP3 series which are owned by Formula 1 or from the licensing of other third party series or individual race events), various TV production and post-production activities, digital media services and other ancillary operations.\nThe $7 million increase in pro forma Other Formula 1 revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily attributable to higher logistics and digital media revenue, contributions from broadcasting in Ultra High Definition and higher hospitality revenue, partially offset by lower spend by GP3 series' competing teams during 2017 due to it being the second year of the GP3 vehicle cycle.\nTable 195: <table></table>\nII-26\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTeam payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(919)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(302)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(290)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,256)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPro forma Cost of Formula 1 revenue decreased approximately $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Cost of Formula 1 revenue consists primarily of team payments.\nTeam payments decreased by $47 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decreases in pro forma team payments during 2017 were attributable to the pro rata recognition impact of the cost recognition policy being applied to fixed and variable Prize Fund elements.\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue include hospitality costs, which are principally related to catering and other aspects of the production and delivery of the Paddock Club, and circuit rights' fees payable under various agreements with race promoters to acquire certain commercial rights at Events, including the right to sell advertising, hospitality and support race opportunities. Other costs include annual Federation Internationale de l'Automobile regulatory fees, advertising and sponsorship commissions and those incurred in the provision and sale of freight, travel and logistical services, and GP3 cars, parts and maintenance services, television production and post-production services, advertising production services and digital and social media activities. These costs are largely variable in nature and relate directly to revenue opportunities. The $12 million increase in other costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year is due to increasing fan engagement activities, filming in Ultra High definition and higher freight, digital media and hospitality costs, partially offset by a lower circuit rights' fee under the contractual arrangements of one Event and the impact of one less Event in the year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs, legal, professional and other advisory fees, bad debt expense, rental expense, information technology costs, non-Event-related travel costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and utility costs and other general office administration costs. Pro forma Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increases in pro forma selling, general and administrative expense during 2017 were primarily driven by higher personnel, property, marketing and research costs and advisory fees, all due to the acquisition by Liberty of Formula 1, partially offset by an improvement in foreign exchange related gains and lower bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nStock-based compensation expense during 2017 relates to costs arising from grants of Series C Liberty Formula One common stock options and restricted stock units to members of Formula 1 management during March 2017, subsequent to the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets. The pro forma depreciation and amortization increased $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nBraves Group\nBraves Holdings.\u2003Braves Holdings is our wholly owned subsidiary that indirectly owns and operates the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club and five minor league baseball clubs (the Gwinnett Stripers, the Mississippi Braves, the Rome Braves, the Danville Braves and the GCL Braves). Braves Holdings also operates a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and leases a baseball facility from a third party in connection with its academy. Braves Holdings had exclusive operating rights to Turner Field, the home stadium of the Atlanta Braves, until December 31, 2016 pursuant to an Operating Agreement with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves\nII-27\nrelocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta. The facility is leased from Cobb County and Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and offers a range of activities and eateries for fans. Braves Holdings and its affiliates participated in the construction of the new stadium and are participating in the construction of an adjacent mixed-use development project, which we refer to as the Development Project.\nOperating results attributable to the Braves Holdings were as follows.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation included below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(281)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(224)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(189)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(98)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(54)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(51)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(67)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(32)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(106)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(57)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue is derived from three primary sources: ballpark operations (ticket sales, concessions, corporate sales, suites and premium seat fees), local broadcast rights and national broadcast, licensing and other shared Major League Baseball ( MLB\u201d) revenue streams. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue increased $124 million and increased $19 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in the number of tickets sold, the average ticket price, concession revenue and increases in revenue related to the Development Project. The increase in revenue for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to a change in ballpark retail and concession sales and increased broadcasting revenue, as well as having more home games period over period (81 home games in 2016 versus 80 home games during 2015), although attendance per game and the average ticket price was lower in 2016 as compared to 2015. Braves Holdings brought its retail operations in-house during 2016 and engaged a new concessions operator for the 2016 season. These contractual changes resulted in increases in revenue, which were offset by corresponding increases in operating expenses. As a result, concession and retail revenue increased approximately $17 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year. Broadcast revenue increased approximately $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. The increase in broadcast revenue was due to an increase in the number of home games during 2016 and contractual rate increases.\nOther operating expense primarily includes costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other operating expenses increased $57 million and increased $35 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven primarily by increases in player costs and higher concession, parking and security costs associated with the new stadium. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven primarily by in-game retail and concession operations, as discussed above. Braves Holdings' decision to operate its retail operations in-house during 2016 contributed to an increase in operating expenses due to additional staff positions related to the retail operations. Additionally, certain concessions expenses were incurred during 2016 associated with the Braves Holdings' new concessions operator for the 2016 season. The 2016 increase was further impacted by the acceleration of player salary expense as a result of released and injured players as well as taxes imposed on ANLBC under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement related to certain international player signing bonuses paid by ANLBC during 2016. These increases were partially offset by overall lower player salaries during 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $44 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to costs incurred with the new stadium and the write-off of certain contractual rights\nII-28\nrelated to international players. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to additional advertising costs incurred during 2016.\nStock-based compensation increased $37 million and decreased $1 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The Braves Holdings three-year stock compensation plan was approved during May 2015. Stock-based compensation expense is attributable to awards vested during the periods presented. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in the value of Braves Holdings and vesting of outstanding awards. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 is attributable to a decrease in the valuation of outstanding Braves Holdings awards granted.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $35 million and $1 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in property and equipment to support the Development Project. The increase during 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation on certain assets associated with the termination of the Turner Field lease at the end of 2016.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the company, covering its various segments and interests in media and entertainment companies.

SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems-the Sirius system and the XM system. Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus\nII-6\nfeatures such as SiriusXM On Demand, over SIRIUS XM's Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services, which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2017 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies, such as Time Warner, Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d), which is accounted for at fair market value and is included in corporate and other.\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nThe term Liberty SiriusXM Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Liberty SiriusXM Group is primarily comprised of Liberty's subsidiary, SIRIUS XM, corporate cash and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As of December 31, 2017, the Liberty SiriusXM Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $615 million, which includes $69 million of subsidiary cash.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and\nII-7\ntake appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. Also upon the Recapitalization, Liberty had attributed to the Braves Group all liabilities arising under a note from Braves Holdings to Liberty, with a total capacity of up to $165 million of borrowings by Braves Holdings (the Intergroup Note\u201d) relating to funds to be borrowed and used for investment in the Development Project. As discussed below, the Intergroup Note, including accrued interest, was repaid during June 2016 using proceeds from the subscription rights offering and the Intergroup Note agreement was cancelled. As of December 31, 2017, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $132 million, which includes $55 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group.\nFollowing the Recapitalization, Liberty issued subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock. In the rights distribution, Liberty distributed 0.47 of a Series C Liberty Braves subscription right for each share of Series A, Series B or Series C Liberty Braves common stock held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 16, 2016. Fractional Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights were rounded up to the nearest whole right. Each whole Series C Liberty Braves subscription right entitled the holder to purchase, pursuant to the basic subscription privilege, one share of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock at a subscription price of $12.80, which was equal to an approximate 20% discount to the trading day volume weighted average trading price of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock for the 18-day trading period ending on May 11, 2016. Each Series C Liberty Braves subscription right also entitled the holder to subscribe for additional shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock that were unsubscribed for in the rights offering pursuant to an oversubscription privilege. The rights offering commenced on May 18, 2016, which was also the ex-dividend date for the distribution of the Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights. The rights offering expired at 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on June 16, 2016 and was fully subscribed with 15,833,634 shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, if applicable, oversubscription privileges. Approximately $150 million of the proceeds from the rights offering were used to repay the outstanding balance on the Intergroup Note and accrued interest to Liberty. The remaining proceeds will be used for future development costs attributed to the Braves Group.\nThe term Formula One Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, a minority equity investment in Time Warner, the recovery received in connection with the Vivendi lawsuit and cash, as well as Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $202 million, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $282 million, which includes $165 million of subsidiary cash.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nSIRIUS XM.\u2003SIRIUS XM is focused on several initiatives to increase its revenue. SIRIUS XM regularly evaluates its business plans and strategy. Currently, its strategies include:\n \u00b7 the acquisition and pricing of unique or compelling programming; \nII-8\n \u00b7 the development and introduction of new features or services; \n \u00b7 significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; \n \u00b7 investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and \n \u00b7 acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments that are not directly related to its satellite radio business. \nSIRIUS XM faces certain key challenges in its attempt to meet these goals, including:\n \u00b7 its ability to convince owners and lessees of new and previously owned vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to its service; \n \u00b7 potential loss of subscribers due to economic conditions and competition from other entertainment providers; \n \u00b7 competition for both listeners and advertisers, including providers of radio and other audio services; \n \u00b7 the operational performance of its satellites; \n \u00b7 the effectiveness of integration of acquired businesses and assets into its operations; \n \u00b7 the performance of its manufacturers, programming providers, vendors, and retailers; and \n \u00b7 unfavorable changes in legislation. \nFormula 1.\u2003Formula 1's goal is to further broaden and increase the global scale and appeal of the World Championship in order to improve the overall value of Formula 1 as a sport and its financial performance. Key factors of this strategy include:\n \u00b7 continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe; \n \u00b7 developing advertising and sponsorship revenue, including increasing sales of Event-based packages and under the Global Partner program, and exploring opportunities in underexploited product categories; \n \u00b7 capturing opportunities created by media's evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1's digital media assets; and \n \u00b7 building up the entertainment experience for fans and engaging with new fans on a global basis to further drive race attendance and television viewership. \nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nGeneral.\u2003We provide in the tables below information regarding our Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments. The corporate and other\u201d category consists of those assets or businesses which do not qualify as a separate reportable segment. For a more detailed discussion and analysis of the financial results of our principal reportable segment, see Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below.\nII-9\nConsolidated Operating Results\n\nRevenue.\u2003Our consolidated revenue increased $2,318 million and $481 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year.\nII-10\nThe 2016 increase was primarily driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $462 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nOperating income.\u2003Our consolidated operating income decreased $340 million and increased $780 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. Formula One Group operating income improved $524 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the Vivendi lawsuit settlement. In addition, Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $279 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the Braves Group operating loss which increased $23 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nStock-based compensation.\u2003Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nWe recorded $230 million, $150 million and $204 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nUpon acquisition of a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM, we recorded an adjustment to increase SIRIUS XM's unvested stock-based compensation to fair value and amortized this adjustment through December 31, 2015. SIRIUS XM stock-based compensation expense in 2015 included $73 million of this purchase price amortization expense. This caused a decrease in 2016 stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Company, which was partially offset by a $25 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recognized by SIRIUS XM during 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately $30 million. Such amount will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. As of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SIRIUS XM stock options and restricted stock units was $242 million. The SIRIUS XM unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nAdjusted OIBDA.\u2003We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the\nII-11\nmeasurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 million and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the $45 million and $46 million of expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties expense line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of the Company's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\nSIRIUS XM recognized approximately $43 million, $40 million and $127 million of Revenue share and royalties within the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the SIRIUS XM legal settlement associated with SIRIUS XM's use of certain pre-1972 sound recordings. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million, $40 million and $19 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $720 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $442 million, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2016 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $178 million, partially offset by declines in Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $23 million and Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $10 million.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nII-12\nOther Income and Expense\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\n\nInterest expense.\u2003Consolidated interest expense increased $229 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1. The remaining increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the average amount of corporate, SIRIUS XM and other subsidiary debt outstanding.\nII-13\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates.\u2003The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, an equity method affiliate of Braves Holdings sold a controlling interest in a subsidiary, resulting in Braves Holdings recording its portion of the gain of $69 million.\nThe increase in our share of Live Nation's earnings during 2016 was primarily due to an improvement in Live Nation's net income during 2016, primarily driven by an improvement in operating income and increased equity in earnings of Live Nation's nonconsolidated affiliates during the year. The improvement in Live Nation's net income during 2016 was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of its senior secured credit facility during 2016. Accordingly, the Company relieved a portion of the underlying difference in the equity of Live Nation related to the debt extinguished during 2016.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments.\u2003Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\n\nThe losses on Fair Value Option Securities (as defined in note 3 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements) during 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to general decreases in market valuation adjustments during the respective years. The gain on Fair Value Option Securities during 2016 is primarily due to a general increase in market valuation adjustments during the year.\nChanges in unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable.\nLiberty issued $1 billion of cash convertible notes in October 2013 which are accounted for at fair value, as elected by Liberty at the time of issuance of the notes. At the same time, Liberty entered into a bond hedge transaction on the same amount of underlying shares. These derivatives are marked to fair value on a", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\u2003Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. See note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\nOverview\nWe own controlling and non-controlling interests in a broad range of media and entertainment companies. Our most significant operating subsidiary, which is a reportable segment, is SIRIUS XM. SIRIUS XM provides a subscription based satellite radio service. SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems-the Sirius system and the XM system. Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus\nII-6\nfeatures such as SiriusXM On Demand, over SIRIUS XM's Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services, which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2017 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies, such as Time Warner, Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d), which is accounted for at fair market value and is included in corporate and other.\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nThe term Liberty SiriusXM Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Liberty SiriusXM Group is primarily comprised of Liberty's subsidiary, SIRIUS XM, corporate cash and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As of December 31, 2017, the Liberty SiriusXM Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $615 million, which includes $69 million of subsidiary cash.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and\nII-7\ntake appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. Also upon the Recapitalization, Liberty had attributed to the Braves Group all liabilities arising under a note from Braves Holdings to Liberty, with a total capacity of up to $165 million of borrowings by Braves Holdings (the Intergroup Note\u201d) relating to funds to be borrowed and used for investment in the Development Project. As discussed below, the Intergroup Note, including accrued interest, was repaid during June 2016 using proceeds from the subscription rights offering and the Intergroup Note agreement was cancelled. As of December 31, 2017, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $132 million, which includes $55 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group.\nFollowing the Recapitalization, Liberty issued subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock. In the rights distribution, Liberty distributed 0.47 of a Series C Liberty Braves subscription right for each share of Series A, Series B or Series C Liberty Braves common stock held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 16, 2016. Fractional Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights were rounded up to the nearest whole right. Each whole Series C Liberty Braves subscription right entitled the holder to purchase, pursuant to the basic subscription privilege, one share of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock at a subscription price of $12.80, which was equal to an approximate 20% discount to the trading day volume weighted average trading price of Liberty's Series C Liberty Braves common stock for the 18-day trading period ending on May 11, 2016. Each Series C Liberty Braves subscription right also entitled the holder to subscribe for additional shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock that were unsubscribed for in the rights offering pursuant to an oversubscription privilege. The rights offering commenced on May 18, 2016, which was also the ex-dividend date for the distribution of the Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights. The rights offering expired at 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on June 16, 2016 and was fully subscribed with 15,833,634 shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, if applicable, oversubscription privileges. Approximately $150 million of the proceeds from the rights offering were used to repay the outstanding balance on the Intergroup Note and accrued interest to Liberty. The remaining proceeds will be used for future development costs attributed to the Braves Group.\nThe term Formula One Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, a minority equity investment in Time Warner, the recovery received in connection with the Vivendi lawsuit and cash, as well as Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $202 million, as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $282 million, which includes $165 million of subsidiary cash.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nSIRIUS XM.\u2003SIRIUS XM is focused on several initiatives to increase its revenue. SIRIUS XM regularly evaluates its business plans and strategy. Currently, its strategies include:\n \u00b7 the acquisition and pricing of unique or compelling programming; \nII-8\n \u00b7 the development and introduction of new features or services; \n \u00b7 significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; \n \u00b7 investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and \n \u00b7 acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments that are not directly related to its satellite radio business. \nSIRIUS XM faces certain key challenges in its attempt to meet these goals, including:\n \u00b7 its ability to convince owners and lessees of new and previously owned vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to its service; \n \u00b7 potential loss of subscribers due to economic conditions and competition from other entertainment providers; \n \u00b7 competition for both listeners and advertisers, including providers of radio and other audio services; \n \u00b7 the operational performance of its satellites; \n \u00b7 the effectiveness of integration of acquired businesses and assets into its operations; \n \u00b7 the performance of its manufacturers, programming providers, vendors, and retailers; and \n \u00b7 unfavorable changes in legislation. \nFormula 1.\u2003Formula 1's goal is to further broaden and increase the global scale and appeal of the World Championship in order to improve the overall value of Formula 1 as a sport and its financial performance. Key factors of this strategy include:\n \u00b7 continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe; \n \u00b7 developing advertising and sponsorship revenue, including increasing sales of Event-based packages and under the Global Partner program, and exploring opportunities in underexploited product categories; \n \u00b7 capturing opportunities created by media's evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1's digital media assets; and \n \u00b7 building up the entertainment experience for fans and engaging with new fans on a global basis to further drive race attendance and television viewership. \nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nGeneral.\u2003We provide in the tables below information regarding our Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments.

million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year.\nII-10\nThe 2016 increase was primarily driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $462 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nOperating income.\u2003Our consolidated operating income decreased $340 million and increased $780 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. Formula One Group operating income improved $524 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the Vivendi lawsuit settlement. In addition, Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $279 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by the Braves Group operating loss which increased $23 million during 2016 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nStock-based compensation.\u2003Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nWe recorded $230 million, $150 million and $204 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nUpon acquisition of a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM, we recorded an adjustment to increase SIRIUS XM's unvested stock-based compensation to fair value and amortized this adjustment through December 31, 2015. SIRIUS XM stock-based compensation expense in 2015 included $73 million of this purchase price amortization expense. This caused a decrease in 2016 stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Company, which was partially offset by a $25 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recognized by SIRIUS XM during 2016 as compared to the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately $30 million. Such amount will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. As of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SIRIUS XM stock options and restricted stock units was $242 million. The SIRIUS XM unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nAdjusted OIBDA.\u2003We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the\nII-11\nmeasurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 million and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the $45 million and $46 million of expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties expense line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of the Company's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\nSIRIUS XM recognized approximately $43 million, $40 million and $127 million of Revenue share and royalties within the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the SIRIUS XM legal settlement associated with SIRIUS XM's use of certain pre-1972 sound recordings. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million, $40 million and $19 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $720 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $442 million, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million.\nThe increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2016 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $178 million, partially offset by declines in Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $23 million and Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA of $10 million.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more

expense.\u2003Consolidated interest expense increased $229 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1. The remaining increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the average amount of corporate, SIRIUS XM and other subsidiary debt outstanding.\nII-13\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates.\u2003The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSIRIUS XM Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Liberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Braves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLive Nation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Formula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(48)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, an equity method affiliate of Braves Holdings sold a controlling interest in a subsidiary, resulting in Braves Holdings recording its portion of the gain of $69 million.\nThe increase in our share of Live Nation's earnings during 2016 was primarily due to an improvement in Live Nation's net income during 2016, primarily driven by an improvement in operating income and increased equity in earnings of Live Nation's nonconsolidated affiliates during the year. The improvement in Live Nation's net income during 2016 was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of its senior secured credit facility during 2016. Accordingly, the Company relieved a portion of the underlying difference in the equity of Live Nation related to the debt extinguished during 2016.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments.\u2003Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFair Value Option Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(36)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(151)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt measured at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(126)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(113)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of bond hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe losses on Fair Value Option Securities (as defined in note 3 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements) during 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to general decreases in market valuation adjustments during the respective years.
