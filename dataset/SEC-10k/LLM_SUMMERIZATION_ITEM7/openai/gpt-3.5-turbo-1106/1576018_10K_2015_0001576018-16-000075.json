Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ( Annual Report\u201d).\nThe statements in this discussion regarding business outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to our Introductory Note to this Annual Report and the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company domiciled in Bermuda. Through our reinsurance subsidiaries, we provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies on a worldwide basis. Our goal is to deliver attractive equity returns to our shareholders by combining profitable reinsurance underwriting with superior investment management provided by Third Point LLC, our investment manager. We believe that our reinsurance and investment strategy differentiates us from our competitors.\nWe manage our business on the basis of two operating segments: Property and Casualty Reinsurance and Catastrophe Risk Management. We also have a corporate function that includes our investment income on capital, certain general and administrative expenses related to corporate activities, interest expense and income tax expense.\nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance\nWe provide reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies, government entities, and other risk bearing vehicles. Contracts can be written on an excess of loss basis or quota share basis, although the majority of contracts written to date have been on a quota share basis. In addition, we write contracts on both a prospective basis and a retroactive basis. Prospective reinsurance contracts cover losses incurred as a result of future insurable events. Retroactive reinsurance contracts cover the potential for changes in estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to loss events that have occurred in the past. Retroactive reinsurance contracts can be an attractive type of contract for us as they can generate an underwriting profit should the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses settle for less than the initial estimate of reserves and the premiums received at the inception of the contract generate insurance float. The product lines that we currently underwrite for this operating segment are: property, casualty and specialty. We assume a minimal amount of catastrophe risk within the property and casualty segment. We anticipate that our property catastrophe exposures will consistently remain extremely low when compared to many other reinsurers with whom we compete.\nIn February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc. ( TPRUSA\u201d). The results of Third Point Re USA are reflected in the results of the Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment. Third Point Re USA and TPRUSA have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in their results of operations. As a result, period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy. As a result of Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence, we have expanded our marketing activities and have begun to broaden our profile in the U.S. marketplace. In addition to developing new opportunities, we are strengthening our relationships with existing cedents and brokers. We also intend to continue developing a firsthand understanding of cedent underwriting and claims capabilities that will benefit our underwriting decisions.\nInsurance float is an important aspect of our property and casualty reinsurance operation. In an insurance or reinsurance operation, float arises because premiums from reinsurance contracts and consideration received for deposit accounted c\nontracts are collected before losses are paid on reinsurance contracts and proceeds are returned on deposit accounting contracts. In some instances, the interval between cash receipts and payments can extend over many years. During this time interval, we invest the cash received and seek to generate investment returns. Float is not a concept defined by U.S. GAAP and therefore, there are no comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Float, as a result, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure.\nWe believe that our property and casualty reinsurance segment will contribute to our results by both generating underwriting income as well as generating float. In addition, we expect that float will grow over time as our reinsurance operations expand.\nCatastrophe Risk Management\nIn contrast to many reinsurers with whom we compete, we have elected to limit our underwriting of property catastrophe exposures. Through December 2014, we wrote excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance through the Catastrophe Fund, which was a separately capitalized reinsurance fund vehicle. In December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund and that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Catastrophe Fund distributed $119.4 million (Third Point Re's share - $59.4 million) resulting in a distribution of non-controlling interests for the Catastrophe Fund of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, the Catastrophe Fund had a net asset value of $119.7 million, and our investment in the Catastrophe Fund was $59.5 million.\nInvestment Management\nOur investment strategy is implemented by our investment manager, Third Point LLC, under two long-term investment management contracts. We directly own the investments that are held in two separate accounts and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as Third Point LLC's main hedge funds.\nLimited Operating History and Comparability of Results\nWe were incorporated on October 6, 2011 and completed our initial capitalization on December 22, 2011. We began underwriting business on January 1, 2012. We completed an initial public offering of common shares on August 20, 2013 (the IPO\u201d). As a result, we have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in our results of operations. Period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful.\nIn addition, the amount of premiums written may vary from year to year and from period to period as a result of several factors, including changes in market conditions and our view of the long-term profit potential of individual lines of business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Such measures, including net investment income on float, book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity, are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. We believe these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are referenced below.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that by combining a disciplined and opportunistic approach to reinsurance underwriting with investment results from the active management of our investment portfolio, we will be able to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. The key financial measures that we believe are most meaningful in analyzing our performance are: net underwriting income (loss) for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, combined ratio for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, net investment income (loss), net investment return on investments managed by Third\nPoint LLC, book value per share, diluted book value per share, growth in diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity.\nThe table below shows the key performance indicators for our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands, except for per share data and ratios)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key underwriting metrics for Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net underwriting loss (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio (1)\n</td> <td>104.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key investment return metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key shareholders' value creation metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in diluted book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on beginning shareholders' equity (2)\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a calculation of net underwriting loss and combined ratio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See reconciliations below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Underwriting Income (Loss) for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nOne way that we evaluate the performance of our property and casualty reinsurance results is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We do not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Net underwriting income or loss is calculated from net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to the underwriting activities.\nCombined Ratio for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nCombined ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net, acquisition costs, net and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities by net premiums earned. The combined ratio compares the amount of net premiums earned to the amount incurred in claims and underwriting related expenses. This ratio is a key indicator of a reinsurance company's profitability. A combined ratio greater than 100% means that loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities exceeded net premiums earned. See additional information in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Investment Income (Loss)\nNet investment income (loss) is an important measure that affects overall profitability. Net investment income (loss) is affected by the performance of Third Point LLC as our exclusive investment manager and the amount of investable cash, or float, generated by our reinsurance operations. Pursuant to our investment management agreements, Third Point LLC is required to manage our investment portfolio on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, subject to certain conditions set forth in our investment guidelines. These conditions include limitations on investing in private securities, a limitation on portfolio leverage, and a limitation on portfolio concentration in individual securities. Our investment management agreements allow us to withdraw cash from our investment account with Third Point LLC at any time with three days' notice to pay claims and with five days' notice to pay expenses.\nWe track excess cash flows generated by our property and casualty reinsurance operations, or float, in separate accounts that allow us to also track the net investment income (loss) generated on the float. We believe that net investment income (loss) generated on float is an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operations to our consolidated results. It is also explicitly considered as part of the evaluation of management's performance for purposes of long-term incentive compensation. Net investment income (loss) on float as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the table below for a reconciliation of net investment income (loss) on float to net investment income (loss).\nNet investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was comprised of the following:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on float\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,810\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on capital\n</td> <td>(18,798\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n</td> <td>(29,608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income on cash held by the Catastrophe Reinsurer and Catastrophe Fund\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on catastrophe bond held by Catastrophe Reinsurer\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on investment in Kiskadee Fund\n</td> <td>1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on reinsurance contract derivatives written by the Catastrophe Reinsurer\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC\nNet investment return represents the return on our investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our investment assets managed by Third Point LLC, net of non-controlling interests. The stated return is net of withholding taxes, which are presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.\nBook Value Per Share and Diluted Book Value Per Share\nBook value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders by the number of issued and outstanding shares at period end. Diluted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders and adjusted to include unvested restricted shares and the exercise of all in-the-money options and warrants. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Prior to TPRE's initial public offering, the market share price was assumed to be equal to the fully diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings. In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, book value per share decreased by $0.81 per share, or 5.8%, to $13.23 per share from $14.04 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, book value per share increased by $0.56 per share, or 4.2%, to $14.04 per share from $13.48 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, diluted book value per share decreased by $0.70 per share, or 5.2%, to $12.85 per share from $13.55 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, diluted book value per share increased by $0.43 per share, or 3.3%, to $13.55 per share from $13.12 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nThe decrease in basic and diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a net loss during the year as a result of our negative investment return and, to a lesser extent, our underwriting loss in the year. The increase in basic and diluted book value per share for the\nyear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to net income during the year.\nThe diluted book value per share in both years also includes warrants and share compensation issued to our Founders, employees, directors and an advisor, including the additional warrants and options that became exercisable as a result of meeting the performance condition after the IPO.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted book value per share as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 : Table 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted book value per share numerator:\n</td> <td>($ in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,395,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,552,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(16,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders\n</td> <td>1,379,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive warrants issued to Founders and an advisor\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive share options issued to directors and employees\n</td> <td>58,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share numerator:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,484,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,560,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted book value per share denominator:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued and outstanding shares\n</td> <td>104,256,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,397,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,264,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive warrants issued to Founders and an advisor\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive share options issued to directors and employees\n</td> <td>5,788,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,151,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,784,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees (1)\n</td> <td>837,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>922,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share denominator:\n</td> <td>115,533,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,123,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,357,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic book value per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, the effect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees was comprised of 301,043 restricted shares with a service condition only and 536,234 of restricted shares with a service and performance condition that were considered probable of vesting.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning of year shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we have adjusted the beginning shareholders' equity for the impact of the issuance of shares in our IPO on a weighted average basis. This adjustment lowers the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity. We believe this metric is used by investors to supplement measures of our profitability.\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was calculated as follows: Table 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders - beginning of year\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>868,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of weighting related to shareholders' equity from IPO\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders - beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on beginning shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>premiums from property and casualty reinsurance business assumed; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income from investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Premiums from our property and casualty reinsurance business assumed are directly related to the number, type and pricing of contracts we write.

Loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Depending on the nature of the contract, loss and loss adjustment expenses may be paid over a number of years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes and other direct expenses that relate to writing reinsurance contracts and are presented net of commissions ceded under reinsurance contracts. We amortize deferred acquisition costs in the same proportion that the premiums are earned.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees we pay to our investment manager, Third Point LLC, and certain of our Founders and performance fees we pay to TP GP. A 2% management fee calculated on assets under management is paid monthly to Third Point LLC and certain of our Founders, and a performance fee equal to 20% of the net investment income is paid annually to TP GP. We include these expenses in net investment income (loss) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The performance fee is subject to a loss carryforward provision pursuant to which TP GP is required to maintain a Loss Recovery Account, which represents the sum of all prior period net loss amounts, not offset by prior year net profit amounts, and which is allocated to future profit amounts until the Loss Recovery Account has returned to a positive balance. Until such time, no performance fees are payable under the Investment Agreements.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and related payroll costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, share compensation expense, legal and accounting fees, travel and client entertainment, fees relating to our letter of credit facilities, information technology, occupancy and other general operating expenses.\nOther expenses consist of investment credit expenses on deposit liabilities and reinsurance contracts and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in our deposit and reinsurance contracts.\nInterest expense consists of interest expense incurred on TPRUSA's $115.0 million senior unsecured notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in February 2015. The Notes bear interest at 7.0% and interest is payable semi-annually on February 13 and August 13 of each year. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of certain costs incurred in issuing the Notes. These costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in interest expense.\nIncome taxes consist primarily of taxes incurred in the U.S. as a result of our U.S. operations and withholding taxes and uncertain tax positions on certain investment transactions in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting and reporting policies.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimations by management are: (1) premium revenue recognition including evaluation of risk transfer, (2) loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and (3) fair value measurements related to our investments. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying judgments or estimates used by management in the application of these accounting policies, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPremium Revenue Recognition Including Evaluation of Risk Transfer\nFor each contract that we write, we estimate the ultimate premium for the entire contract period and record this estimate at the inception of the contract, to the extent the amount of written premium is estimable. For contracts where the full written premium is not estimable at inception, we record written premium for the portion of the contract period for which the amount is estimable. These estimates are based primarily on information in the underlying contracts as well as information provided by our clients and/or brokers. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on premium revenue recognition.\nChanges in premium estimates are expected and may result in adjustments in any reporting period. These estimates change over time as additional information regarding the underlying business volume is obtained. Along with uncertainty regarding the underlying business volume, our contracts also contain a number of contractual features that can significantly impact the amount of premium that we ultimately recognize. These include commutation provisions, multi-year contracts with cancellation provisions and provisions to return premium at the expiration of the contract in certain circumstances. In certain contracts, these provisions can be exercised by the client, in some cases provisions can be exercised by us and in other cases by mutual consent. In addition, we write a small number of large contracts and the majority of our property and casualty reinsurance segment premiums written to date has been quota share business. As a result, we may be subject to greater volatility around our premium estimates compared to other property and casualty companies. We continuously monitor the premium estimates for each of our contracts considering the cash premiums received, reported premiums, discussions with our clients regarding their premium projections as well as evaluating the potential impact of contractual features. Any subsequent adjustments arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nChanges in premium estimates may not result in a direct impact to net income or shareholders' equity since changes in premium estimates do not necessarily impact the amount of net premiums earned at the time of the premium estimate change and would generally be offset by proportional changes in acquisition costs and net loss and loss adjustment expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $39.3 million of changes in premium estimates on prior years' contracts, (2014 - $(12.1) million 2013 - $(35.7) million). There was an insignificant impact on net income of these changes in premium estimates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The 2015 increases in premium estimates were primarily due to two contracts where the cedants reported writing significantly more business than initially expected. The 2014 decreases in premium estimates were primarily due to contracts where the clients reported writing less business than initially expected. The 2013 changes in premium estimates were primarily due to return premiums on contracts that expired in 2013 and that included a contractual provision to return the unearned premiums at expiration.\nDetermining whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to recognizing premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial pricing models and assumptions and evaluating contractual features that could impact the determination of whether a contract meets risk transfer. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we use deposit\naccounting. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on deposit contracts entered into to date.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOur loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not yet reported ( IBNR reserves\u201d) and deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Case reserves are established for losses that have been reported, but not yet paid, based on loss reports from brokers and ceding companies. IBNR reserves represent the estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown future developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses that are known to us. IBNR reserves are established by management based on actuarially determined estimates of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred gains represent the underwriting profit related to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts at inception and are deferred and amortized over the estimated future payout of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Any underwriting loss at inception related to retroactive exposures in a reinsurance contract is recognized immediately.\nInherent in the estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. Accordingly, ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the period in which they become known.\nWe perform an actuarial projection of our reserves quarterly and have a third-party actuarial review performed annually. All reserves are estimated on an individual contract basis; there is no aggregation of contracts for projection of ultimate loss or reserves.\nWe initially reserve every individual contract to the expected loss and loss expense ratio in the pricing analysis.\nAs loss information is received from the cedents, we incorporate other actuarial methods into our projection of ultimate losses and, hence, reserves. In our pricing analysis, we typically use a significant amount of information unique to the individual client and, when necessary, supplement the analysis with industry data. Industry data primarily takes the form of paid and incurred development patterns from statutory financial statements and statistical agencies. For our actuarial reserve projections, the relevant information we receive from our clients include premium estimates, paid loss and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves. We review the data for reasonableness and research any anomalies. On each contract, we compare the expected paid and incurred amounts at each quarter-end with actual amounts reported. We also compare premiums received with projected premium receipts at each quarter end.\nThere is a time lag between when a covered loss event occurs and when it is actually reported to our cedents. The actuarial methods that we use to estimate losses have been designed to address this lag in loss reporting. There is also a time lag between when clients pay claims, establish case reserves and re-estimate their reserves, and when they notify us of the payments and/or new or revised case reserves. This reporting lag is typically 60 to 90 days after the end of a reporting period, but can be longer in some cases. We use techniques that adjust for this reporting lag. While it would be unusual to have lags that extend beyond 90 days, our actuarial techniques are designed to adjust for such a circumstance.\nThe principal actuarial methods (and associated key assumptions) we use to perform our quarterly loss reserve analysis may include one or more of the following methods:\nA Priori Loss Ratio Method\nTo estimate ultimate losses under the a priori loss ratio method, we multiply earned premiums by an expected loss ratio. The expected loss ratio is selected as part of the pricing and utilizes individual client data, supplemented by industry data where necessary. This method is often useful when there is limited historical data due to few losses being incurred.\nPaid Loss Development Method\nThis method estimates ultimate losses by calculating past paid loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development. The paid loss development method assumes that losses are paid at a rate consistent with the historical rate of payment. It provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no reserve estimates. For some lines of business, claim payments are made slowly and it may take many years for claims to be fully reported and settled.\nIncurred Loss Development Method\nThis method estimates ultimate losses by using past incurred loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected incurred loss development. Since incurred losses include payments and case reserves, changes in both of these amounts are incorporated in this method. This approach provides a larger volume of data to estimate ultimate losses than paid loss methods. Thus, incurred loss patterns may be less varied than paid loss patterns, especially for coverages that have historically been paid out over a long period of time but for which claims are incurred relatively early and case loss reserve estimates are established.\nBornhuetter-Ferguson Paid and Incurred Loss Methods\nThese methods are a weighted average of the a priori loss ratio and the relevant development factor method. The weighting between the two methods depends on the maturity of the business. This means that for the more recent years a greater weight is placed on the a priori loss ratio, while for the more mature years a greater weight is placed on the development factor methods. These methods avoid some of the distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a small base of paid or incurred losses to calculate ultimate losses. This method will react slowly if actual paid or incurred loss experience develops differently than historical paid or incurred loss experience because of major changes in rate levels, retentions or deductibles, the forms and conditions of coverage, the types of risks covered or a variety of other factors.\nIBNR to Outstanding Ratio Method\nThis method is used in selected cases typically for very mature years that still have open claims. This method assumes that the estimated future loss development is indicated by the current level of case reserves.\nKey to the projection of ultimate loss is the amount of credibility or weight assigned to each actuarial method. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and those can change depending on numerous factors including the reliability of the underlying data. For most actuaries, the selection and weighting of the projection methods is a highly subjective process. In order to achieve a desirable amount of consistency from study to study and between contracts, we have implemented a weighting scheme that incorporates numerous rules\u201d for the weighting of actuarial methods. These rules attempt to effectively standardize the process used for selecting weights for the various methods. There are numerous circumstances where the rules would be modified for specific reinsurance contracts; examples would include a large market event or new information on historical years that may cause us to increase our a priori loss ratio.\nAs part of our quarterly reserving process, loss-sensitive contingent expenses (e.g., profit commissions, sliding-scale ceding commissions, etc.) are calculated on an individual contract basis. These expense calculations are based on the updated ultimate loss estimates derived from our quarterly reserving process.\nOur reserving methodologies use a loss reserving model that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate losses. Although we believe that our assumptions and methodologies are reasonable, the ultimate payments may vary, potentially materially, from the estimates that we have made.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe table below shows the impact of reasonably likely changes to our actuarial estimates of our client's ceded loss on the following: loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, net; acquisition costs, net; net underwriting loss and shareholders' equity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Since many contracts that we write have sliding scale commissions, profit commissions, loss corridors or other loss mitigating features that adjust with or offset the\nloss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, we consider these contractual features to be important in understanding the sensitivity of our results to changes in loss ratio assumptions.\nThe following table illustrates the aggregate impact of a ten percent increase and decrease applied to the subject ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net for each in-force contract in the property and casualty reinsurance segment. In cases where a loss corridor applies, a 10% increase (or decrease) in our estimate of the subject ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net, may not translate to an increase (or decrease) in the assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses, net. In cases where a sliding scale ceding commission or profit commission applies, a 10% increase (or decrease) in our estimate of the subject ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net, does translate to an increase (or decrease) in the assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses, but that increase (or decrease) may be offset by a decrease (or increase) in the acquisition costs, net.\nAs a result of the contractual features mentioned above, many of our reinsurance contracts provide for a maximum margin. Consequently, our upside potential on these contracts is limited. In these cases, the relative impact of the adverse development scenario is greater than the impact of the favorable development scenario.\nThese increases and decreases are only applied to contracts which currently have material reserves outstanding (where material is defined as more than 10% of assumed ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net). Assumed ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net, represents the sum we would be obligated to pay for fully developed claims (i.e., paid losses plus outstanding reported losses and IBNR losses). The impact to shareholder's equity does not consider the cash flow, and thus, investment income considerations associated with an increase or decrease in subject ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>10% increase in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10% decrease in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(67,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs, net\n</td> <td>(15,183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in net underwriting loss\n</td> <td>40,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,395,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,395,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value measurements\nOur investments are managed by Third Point LLC and are carried at fair value. Our investment manager, Third Point LLC, has a formal valuation policy that sets forth the pricing methodology for investments to be used in determining the fair value of each security in our portfolio. The valuation policy is updated and approved at least on an annual basis by Third Point LLC's valuation committee (the Committee\u201d), which is comprised of officers and employees who are senior business management personnel of Third Point LLC. The Committee meets on a monthly basis. The Committee's role is to review and verify the propriety and consistency of the valuation methodology to determine the fair value of investments. The Committee also reviews any due diligence performed and approves any changes to current or potential external pricing vendors.\nSecurities listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ are valued at their last sales price as of the last business day of the period. Listed securities with no reported sales on such date and over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) securities are valued at their last closing bid price if held long by us, and last closing ask price if held short by us.\nPrivate securities are those not registered for public sale and are carried at an estimated fair value at the end of the period, as determined by Third Point LLC. Valuation techniques, used by Third Point LLC, may include market approach, last transaction analysis, liquidation analysis and/or using discounted cash flow models where the significant inputs could include but are not limited to additional rounds of equity financing, financial metrics such as revenue multiples or price-earnings ratio, discount rates and other factors. In addition, we or Third Point LLC may employ third party\nvaluation firms to conduct separate valuations of such private securities. The third party valuation firms provide us or Third Point LLC with a written report documenting their recommended valuation as of the determination date for the specified investments.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of valuation for private securities, the estimated fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments. The actual value at which these securities could be sold or settled with a willing buyer or seller may differ from our estimated fair values depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, current and future economic conditions, the quantity sold or settled, the presence of an active market and the availability of a willing buyer or seller.\nOur derivatives are recorded at fair value. Third Point LLC values exchange-traded derivative contracts at their last sales price on the exchange where it is primarily traded. OTC derivatives, which include swap, option, swaption, forward, future and contract for differences, are valued by industry recognized pricing vendors when available; otherwise, fair values are obtained from broker quotes that are based on pricing models that consider the time value of money, volatility, and the current market and contractual prices of the underlying financial instruments.\nOur holdings in asset-backed securities are private-label issued, non-investment grade securities, and none of these securities were guaranteed by government sponsored entities. These investments are valued using broker quotes or a recognized third-party pricing vendor. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nWe also have derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are required to be separated from the host contracts and accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value of the embedded derivative reported in net income (loss). Our embedded derivatives relate to interest crediting features in certain reinsurance and deposit contracts that vary based on the returns on our investments managed by Third Point LLC. We determine the value of the embedded derivatives using models developed internally, which approximates fair value.\nWe value our investments in affiliated investment funds at fair value, which is an amount equal to the sum of the capital account in the limited partnership generally determined from financial information provided by the investment manager of the investment funds. The resulting net gains or net losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nThe fair values of investments are estimated using prices obtained from third-party pricing services, when available. However, situations may arise where we believe that the fair value provided by the third-party pricing service does not represent current market conditions. In those situations, Third Point LLC may use dealer quotes to value the investments. For securities that we are unable to obtain fair values from a pricing service or broker, fair values are estimated using information obtained from Third Point LLC.\nWe perform several processes to ascertain the reasonableness of the valuation of all of our investments comprising our investment portfolio. These processes include (i) obtaining and reviewing weekly and monthly investment portfolio reports from Third Point LLC, (ii) obtaining and reviewing monthly NAV and investment return reports received directly from our third-party fund administrator, which are compared to the reports noted in (i), and (iii) monthly update discussions with Third Point LLC regarding the investment portfolio, including, their process for reviewing and validating pricing obtained from outside service providers.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no changes in the valuation techniques as it relates to the above.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the framework for measuring fair value established by U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe reinsurance markets in which we operate have historically been cyclical. During periods of excess underwriting capacity, as defined by the availability of capital, competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers and reinsurers. During periods of reduced underwriting capacity, pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers. Historically, underwriting capacity has been affected by several factors, including industry losses, the impact of catastrophes, changes in legal and regulatory\nguidelines, new entrants, investment results including interest rate levels and the credit ratings and financial strength of competitors.\nWhile management believes pricing remains adequate for certain types of business on which we focus, there is significant underwriting capacity currently available. Market conditions remain challenging, having deteriorated during the year, and we believe they could deteriorate further in the near term. The segment with the greatest pricing pressure is property catastrophe reinsurance due to an influx of capacity from collateralized reinsurance and other insurance-linked securities vehicles and the absence of significant catastrophe events over the past three years. In response to deteriorating property catastrophe market conditions, traditional reinsurers are more aggressively pursuing our targeted lines of business.\nWe focus on segments and clients where we believe we benefit from relatively more attractive pricing opportunities due to the strength of our relationships, the tailored nature of our reinsurance solutions or an acute need for reinsurance capital as a result of a client's growth or historically poor performance. Most of our senior management team have spent decades within the reinsurance market and have strong relationships with intermediaries and reinsurance buyers from which we are receiving a strong flow of submissions in the lines and types of reinsurance we target. Although we are typically presented by brokers with proposed structures on syndicated deals, we often seek to customize the proposed solution for the client while improving our risk and return profile and establishing our position as the lead reinsurer in the transaction. We also look for non-syndicated opportunities where a highly customized solution is needed. These solutions may take the form of aggregate stop loss covers, loss portfolio transfers or reserve covers where clients seek capital relief and enhanced investment returns on the assets that back their loss and unearned premium reserves. We continue to see strong submission flow in this space.\nAfter four years of significant premium growth and float generation, we believe we have reached a level that allows us to rationalize our expense base and appropriately utilize our capital. Given the continued deterioration in market conditions and our focus on improving our underwriting results, we expect to remain selective in our underwriting which may slow the rate of growth in gross written premium.\nIn recent months, there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in the insurance and reinsurance markets, which we believe will have a modest, net negative impact on us. The primary negative impact from consolidation is the merging of primary insurance and reinsurance companies, which reduces the number of potential reinsurance buyers and increases their size, allowing them to retain proportionally more insurance risk. We believe the negative impact will be partially offset by the benefits to us of recent consolidation among reinsurance companies, which has reduced the number of our competitors in a market where reinsurance buyers and brokers usually prefer to syndicate their placement and want counterparty choices. Another benefit of the recent merger and acquisition activity is that we are now one of only a few reinsurance companies that are not affiliated with a primary insurance company. We are seeing some business from reinsurance buyers that we believe do not want to be reinsured by their competitors.\nIn February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of TPRUSA. Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy. As a result of Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence, we have expanded our marketing activities and have begun to broaden our profile in the U.S. marketplace. In addition to developing new opportunities, we are strengthening our relationships with existing cedents and brokers. We also intend to continue developing a firsthand understanding of cedent underwriting and claims capabilities that will benefit our underwriting decisions.\nConsolidated Results of Operations-Years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nThe following table sets forth the key items discussed in the consolidated results of operations section, and the period over period changes, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net underwriting loss (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>(28,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses (2)\n</td> <td>(20,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(7,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(137,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(176,916\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Corporate function only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The primary driver of our results of operations is the performance of our investments managed by Third Point LLC. Given the nature of the underlying investment strategies, we expect volatility in our investment returns and therefore in our consolidated net income (loss). The decrease in net investment income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of lower investment returns, primarily driven by losses in our long equity and performing credit portfolios, partially offset by positive returns in structured credit, sovereign debt and short equity positions.\nThe other key changes in net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily due to the following:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The increase in net underwriting loss includes developments on prior years' contracts resulting in an increase in the net underwriting loss of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In addition, net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes net premiums earned of $108.1 million (2014 - $83.1 million and 2013 - $39.8 million) related to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts.\nNet Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe reinsurance contracts we write have a wide range of initial loss ratio estimates. As a result, our net loss and loss expense ratio can vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business. For example, property quota share contracts have a lower initial loss ratio compared to other casualty and specialty lines of business.\nAcquisition costs\nAcquisition costs include commissions, brokerage and excise taxes. Acquisition costs are presented net of commissions on reinsurance ceded. The reinsurance contracts we write have a wide range of acquisition cost ratios. As a result, our acquisition cost ratio can vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business. For example, our property quota share contracts have a higher initial acquisition cost ratio compared to other casualty and specialty lines of business due to inuring catastrophe reinsurance, which increases the acquisition cost ratio on those contracts. Our property quota share contracts are typically structured to limit the amount of property catastrophe exposure we assume. As a result, inuring catastrophe reinsurance for the property catastrophe exposure reduces the amount of premium we assume relative to the acquisition costs or is an additional component of the acquisition costs. Furthermore, a number of our contracts have a sliding scale commission or profit commission feature that will vary depending on the expected loss expense for the contract. As a result, changes in estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses on a contract can result in changes in the sliding scale commissions or profit commissions and a contract's overall acquisition cost ratio.\nIn general, our contracts have similar expected composite ratios (combined ratio before general and administrative expenses); therefore, contracts with higher initial loss ratio estimates have lower acquisition cost ratios and contracts with lower initial loss ratios have higher acquisition cost ratios.\nRetroactive reinsurance contracts\nWe record the gross premiums written and earned and the net losses as incurred for retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts at the inception of the contract. Our retroactive reinsurance contracts have a higher initial loss ratio since the premiums are generally based on the net loss and loss adjustment reserves and include minimal acquisition related and other expenses. As a result, retroactive reinsurance contracts can significantly impact the mix of premium written by line of business, amount of premiums earned and the composite ratio in a particular period.\nOur net loss and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs and related ratios were impacted by changes in mix of business, deterioration in market conditions and prior year reserve development. The following is a summary of reserve development for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $5.4 million, or 0.9 percentage points, of net favorable prior years' reserve development.\nThe net $5.4 million of favorable prior years' reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2015 was accompanied by net increases of $13.2 million in acquisition costs, resulting in a net increase of $7.8 million in net underwriting loss. The $7.8 million net increase in net underwriting loss was a result of having favorable loss reserve development on certain contracts that was either fully or partially offset by increases in sliding scale or profit commissions whereas certain other contracts with adverse loss development did not have offsetting decreases in acquisition costs to the same degree, resulting in the net favorable development being more than offset by acquisition costs in the current period. The net adverse development was primarily a result of deterioration in attritional loss experience on certain workers' compensation and auto contracts that did not result in offsetting changes in acquisition costs.\nYear ended December 31, 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $0.7 million of net favorable prior years' reserve development. The net $0.7 million of favorable prior years' reserve development was accompanied by net increases of $0.3 million in acquisition costs, resulting in a net decrease of $0.4 million in net underwriting loss. The net adverse development\nwas primarily a result of deterioration in attritional loss experience on certain workers' compensation, auto and property contracts that did not result in offsetting changes in acquisition costs.\nYear ended December 31, 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $1.3 million of net favorable prior years' reserve development. The net $1.3 million of favorable prior years' reserve development was accompanied by net increases of $2.3 million in acquisition costs, resulting in a net increase of $1.0 million in net underwriting loss. The net adverse development was primarily a result of deterioration in attritional loss experience on certain workers' compensation, auto and property contracts that did not result in offsetting changes in acquisition costs.\nNet Investment Income (Loss)\nNet investment income (loss) allocated to the Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment consists of net investment income (loss) on float. The decrease in net investment income (loss) on float for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower investment returns compared to the prior year and an increase in the total amount of float generated by our reinsurance operations. The decrease in net investment income on float for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also due to lower investment returns on investments managed by Third Point LLC but partially offset by an increase in the total amount of the investments attributable to float managed by Third Point LLC. See the discussion of net investment income (loss) under Corporate Function\u201d below for explanations of the investment returns on investments managed by Third Point LLC and total net investment income (loss) for the years presented.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses allocated to underwriting activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to increased headcount and related employee costs, increased share compensation expense, and increased credit facility fees due to higher usage of our letter of credit facilities. Although general and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year, the general and administrative expense ratio decreased due to proportionately higher net premiums earned during the current year period. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related employee costs partially offset by lower stock compensation expense as a result of the IPO which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2013 and resulted in higher stock compensation expense during that year.\nOther Expenses\nThe increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increased number of reinsurance contracts written in 2014 and 2015 that have interest crediting features. This increase was partially offset by lower expenses on contracts with variable interest crediting features as a result of lower investment returns in 2015.\nThe increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to an increased number of reinsurance contracts written in 2014 that had interest crediting features.\nCatastrophe Risk Management\nIn December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund, that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer and that we would be redeeming all existing investments in the Catastrophe Fund. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Catastrophe Fund distributed $119.4 million (Third Point Re's share - $59.4 million) resulting in a distribution from non-controlling interests for the Catastrophe Fund of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCorporate Function\nThe following table sets forth net income (loss) and the period over period changes for the Corporate Function for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(153,701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>(20,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(7,236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange gains\n</td> <td>3,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90,724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(166,252\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Results\nThe primary driver of our net investment income (loss) is the returns generated by our investment portfolio managed by our investment manager, Third Point LLC. The following is a summary of the net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC by investment strategy for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long/short equities\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and sovereign credit (1)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Macro and other\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Effective January 1, 2015, we modified the presentation of our net investment return by investment strategy to include sovereign credit into the corporate and sovereign credit strategy from the macro and other strategy. We believe this classification better represents our portfolio. We have reclassified the 2014 and 2013 returns in the table above to correspond to the current year's presentation.\nThe net investment results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily attributable to losses in our long equity and performing credit portfolios. Losses were partially offset by profitable performance in structured credit, sovereign debt and short equity positions. Within credit, a large sovereign debt investment added meaningfully to returns for the year. Losses in the performing credit book were driven primarily from modest investments in the energy sector. Structured credit was a significant contributor to returns for the year. During the year, our investment manager, Third Point LLC, reduced net exposure by both exiting long positions and adding to the short portfolio. The investment manager maintains high conviction in the portfolio's core positions and is actively monitoring exposures. Refer to ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks\u201d for a list of risks and factors that could adversely impact our investments results.\nAll of our assets managed by Third Point LLC are held in separate accounts and managed under two investment management agreements whereby TP GP, an affiliate of Third Point LLC, has a non-controlling interest in the assets held in the separate accounts. The value of the non-controlling interest is equal to the amounts invested by TP GP, plus performance fees paid earned by TP GP and investment gains and losses thereon.\nOur investment manager, Third Point LLC, manages several funds and may manage other client accounts besides ours, some of which have, or may have, objectives and investment portfolio compositions similar to ours. Because of the similarity or potential similarity of our investment portfolio to other clients of our investment manager, and because,\nas a matter of ordinary course, Third Point LLC provides its clients, including us, and investors in its main hedge funds with results of their respective investment portfolios following the last day of each month, those other clients or investors indirectly may have material nonpublic information regarding our investment portfolio. To address this, and to comply with Regulation FD, we will continue to post on our website under the heading Investment Portfolio Returns located in the Investors section of the website, following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of each month, our preliminary monthly investment results for that month, with additional information regarding our monthly investment results to be posted following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the first business day of the following month.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses allocated to our corporate function include allocations of payroll and related costs for certain executives and non-underwriting staff. We also allocate a portion of overhead and other related costs based on a related headcount analysis. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to separation costs, increased share compensation expense and increased legal and other professional advisor expenses. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to greater payroll and related expenses as a result of increased headcount and increased legal and other professional advisor expenses as a result of operating as a public company.\nInterest Expense\nIn February 2015, TPRUSA issued $115.0 million of senior notes bearing 7.0% interest. As a result, our consolidated results of operations include interest expense of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax expense or benefit is primarily driven by the taxable income or loss generated by our U.S.-based subsidiaries as well as withholding taxes and uncertain tax provisions on our investment portfolio and to a lesser extent, taxes in relation to our U.K. based subsidiaries.\nOur effective tax rate is primarily driven by the portion of taxable income or loss generated by our U.S.-based subsidiaries relative to the income or loss generated by our Bermuda-based operations, which are not subject to corporate income tax.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded income tax expense (benefit), as follows: Table 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) related to U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in uncertain tax positions\n</td> <td>(1,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Withholding taxes on certain investment transactions\n</td> <td>4,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We have recorded $6.6 million of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, the net deferred tax asset was primarily the result of investment losses in our U.S. subsidiaries. We believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we completed the capitalization of our U.S. entities and commenced U.S. underwriting operations. Third Point Re USA made an election under Section 953(d) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be taxed as a U.S. entity. As a result, we expect to be subject to U.S. income tax on income generated by Third Point Re USA and TPRUSA.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a decrease in uncertain tax positions primarily related to the settlement of certain positions in foreign securities resulting in lower gains.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur investment portfolio is concentrated in tradeable securities and is marked to market each day. Pursuant to our investment guidelines as specified in our two investment management agreements with Third Point LLC, at least 60% of our portfolio must be invested in securities of publicly traded companies and governments of OECD high income countries, asset-backed securities, cash, cash equivalents and gold and other precious metals. We can liquidate all or a portion of our investment portfolio at any time with not less than three days' notice to pay claims on our reinsurance contracts, and with not less than five days' notice to pay for expenses, and on not less than 30 days' notice in order to satisfy a requirement of A.M. Best. Since we do not write excess of loss property catastrophe contracts or other types of reinsurance contracts that are typically subject to sudden, acute, liquidity demands, we believe the liquidity provided by our investment portfolio will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $1,182.3 million, or 51.0% of our total investments in securities were classified as Level 1 assets, which are defined as securities valued using quoted prices available in active markets. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the framework for measuring fair value established by U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements.\nGeneral\nThird Point Reinsurance Ltd. is a holding company and has no substantial operations of its own and has moderate cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of corporate expenses. Its assets consist primarily of its investments in subsidiaries. Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.'s ability to pay dividends or return capital to shareholders will depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from those subsidiaries.\nWe and our Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to Bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends. Under the Companies Act, as amended, a Bermuda company may declare or pay a dividend out of distributable reserves only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment, be able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than its liabilities. Under the Insurance Act, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, are prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if they are in breach of their respective minimum solvency margin ( MSM\u201d), enhanced capital ratio ( ECR\u201d) or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where either Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority ( BMA\u201d).\nIn addition, each of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its respective total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year's statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividend) with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda resident director if any of the insurer's directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Third Point Re could pay dividends to Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. of approximately $261.1 million (December 31, 2014 - $326.1 million). Third Point Re USA is also restricted by the amount of capital and surplus that is available for the payment of dividends. In order to remain in compliance with the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement, Third Point Re must have committed funds sufficient to, and must continue to, maintain a minimum level of capital at Third Point Re USA of $250.0 million. Failure to maintain the minimum level of capital required by the Net Worth Maintenance Agreement could limit or prevent Third Point Re USA from paying dividends to us. As a result, Third Point Re USA could pay dividends ultimately to Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. of approximately $11.1 million as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to the regulatory and other contractual constraints to paying dividends, we manage the capital in each of our operating subsidiaries to support our current ratings with A.M. Best. After four years of significant premium growth and float generation, we have reached a level that allows us to rationalize our expense base and appropriately utilize our capital. Given the continued deterioration in market conditions and our focus on improving our underwriting results, we plan to remain selective in our underwriting which may slow the growth rate of our gross written premium.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nHistorically, our sources of funds have primarily consisted of premiums written, reinsurance recoveries, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay loss and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance premiums, acquisition costs, interest expenses, taxes and general and administrative expenses and to purchase investments.\nOur cash flows from operations generally represent the difference between: (l) premiums collected and investment earnings realized and (2) loss and loss expenses paid, reinsurance purchased and underwriting and other expenses paid. Net cash provided by underwriting activities results from excluding investment earnings realized from our operating cash flows results in net cash provided by underwriting activities. Cash flows from operations may differ substantially from net income (loss) and may be volatile from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available to us and other factors. Due to the nature of our underwriting portfolio, claim payments can be unpredictable and may need to be made within relatively short periods of time. Claim payments can also be required several months or years after premiums are collected.\nOperating, investing and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(163,884\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427,144\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,219\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities generally represent net premiums collected less loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses paid. As our underwriting activities have continued to increase, we have generated increasing cash flows from operating activities as the collection of premiums has exceeded the payment of loss and loss adjustment expenses and general and administrative expenses. Excess cash generated from our operating activities is then invested by Third Point LLC, which is reflected in the cash used in investing activities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we contributed $147.1 million, $163.0 million and $124.0 million, respectively, to our separate accounts managed by Third Point LLC from float generated from our reinsurance operations. These amounts do not correspond to the net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCash flows used in investment activities primarily reflects investment activities related to our separate accounts managed by Third Point LLC. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the investment of the net proceeds from our issuance of Notes as part of the initial capitalization of Third Point Re USA and float generated from our reinsurance operations partially offset by payments to settle two deposit liability contracts. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects the investment of float generated from our reinsurance operations. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflects the investment of the net proceeds from our IPO and the investment of float generated by our reinsurance operations.\nIn February 2015, we completed a public offering of senior notes issued by TPRUSA and guaranteed by Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, from which we received net proceeds of approximately $113.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs. We used the net proceeds to TPRUSA, together with a capital contribution received indirectly from Third Point Re, to fund an aggregate contribution of $267.0 million for the initial capitalization of Third Point Re USA.\nThe cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of the proceeds from issuance of Notes, partially offset by distributions of non-controlling interests from the investment affiliate and Catastrophe Fund and payments to settle two deposit liability contracts. The cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of distributions of non-controlling interests from the investment affiliate. Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 relate primarily to the net proceeds generated by our IPO and an increase in deposit liabilities.\nFor the period from inception until December 31, 2015, we have had sufficient cash flow from the proceeds of our initial capitalization and IPO, the issuance of Notes in February 2015, and from our operations to meet our liquidity requirements. We expect that projected operating and capital expenditure requirements and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months will be met by our balance of cash, cash flows generated from operating activities and investment income. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future if we determine that it would be an efficient part of our capital structure.\nIn addition, we expect that our existing cash and cash flow from operations will provide us with the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives. Our ability to generate cash, however, is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, investment returns and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing shareholders may occur. If we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. There is no assurance that we would be able to raise the additional funds on favorable terms or at all. There are regulatory and contractual restrictions and rating agency considerations that might impact the ability of our reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to their respective parent companies, including for purposes of servicing TPRUSA's debt obligations.\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations to date. The effects of inflation are considered implicitly in pricing our reinsurance contracts. Loss reserves are established to recognize likely loss settlements at the date payment is made. Those reserves inherently recognize the effects of inflation. However, the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately resolved.\nCash, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Investments\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of ninety days or less.\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments increased by $205.7 million, or 49.3%, to $623.0 million as of December 31, 2015 from $417.3 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in restricted cash was primarily due to increased letter of credit usage and additional reinsurance contracts requiring collateral. The decrease was partially offset by the release of restricted cash securing collateralized reinsurance contracts previously written by the Catastrophe Reinsurer. In addition, we are now investing a portion of the collateral securing certain reinsurance contracts in U.S. treasury securities and sovereign debt. This portion of the collateral is included in debt securities in the consolidated balance sheet but is disclosed as part of restricted investments.\nLetter of Credit Facilities\nSee Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our letter of credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $270.4 million (December 31, 2014 - $218.5 million) of letters of credit, representing 49.2% of the total available facilities, had been drawn upon (December 31, 2014 - 54.6% (based on total available facilities of $400.0 million)).\nUnder the facilities, we provide collateral that may consist of equity securities, repurchase agreements, restricted cash, and cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2015, total cash and cash equivalents with a fair value of $270.8 million (December 31, 2014 - $219.0 million) was pledged as security against the letters of credit issued. Our ability\nto post collateral securing letters of credit and certain reinsurance contracts depends in part on our ability to borrow against certain assets in our Investment Accounts through prime brokerage arrangements. The loss or reduction in this borrowing capacity could reduce the amount of reinsurance we write or reduce the amount of float that we contribute to our Investment Accounts. These amounts are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets. Each of the facilities contain customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements, A.M. Best Company rating of A- or higher. Each restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facilities, we will be prohibited from paying dividends. We were in compliance with all of the covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nFinancial Condition\nShareholders' equity\nAs of December 31, 2015, total shareholders' equity was $1,395.9 million compared to $1,552.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a net loss of $87.4 million and net distributions of non-controlling interests of $83.9 million, partially offset by issuance of common shares and share compensation expense totaling $15.2 million in the current year period. The net distributions of non-controlling interests included $24.1 million related to our investment in our joint ventures. In addition, the Catastrophe Fund distributed $119.4 million (Third Point Re's share - $59.4 million) of capital resulting in a distribution of non-controlling interests for the Catastrophe Fund of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our non-controlling interests.\nInvestments\nAs of December 31, 2015, total cash and net investments managed by Third Point LLC was $2,062.8 million, compared to $1,802.2 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the net proceeds from our debt issuance of $113.2 million and net float of $147.1 million generated by our reinsurance operations, partially offset by net investment losses on investments managed by Third Point LLC of $29.6 million.\nContractual Obligations\nOn February 13, 2015, TPRUSA issued Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $115.0 million. The Notes bear interest at 7.0% and interest is payable semi-annually on February 13 and August 13 of each year. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., and, in certain circumstances specified in the indenture governing the Notes, certain existing or future subsidiaries of the Company may be required to guarantee the Notes, as described in the indenture governing the Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary events of default, and limits our ability to merge or consolidate or to transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets and TPRUSA's ability to create liens on the voting securities or profit participating equity interests of Third Point Re USA, its wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ( Annual Report\u201d).\nThe statements in this discussion regarding business outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to our Introductory Note to this Annual Report and the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company domiciled in Bermuda. Through our reinsurance subsidiaries, we provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies on a worldwide basis. Our goal is to deliver attractive equity returns to our shareholders by combining profitable reinsurance underwriting with superior investment management provided by Third Point LLC, our investment manager. We believe that our reinsurance and investment strategy differentiates us from our competitors.\nWe manage our business on the basis of two operating segments: Property and Casualty Reinsurance and Catastrophe Risk Management. We also have a corporate function that includes our investment income on capital, certain general and administrative expenses related to corporate activities, interest expense and income tax expense.\nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance\nWe provide reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies, government entities, and other risk bearing vehicles. Contracts can be written on an excess of loss basis or quota share basis, although the majority of contracts written to date have been on a quota share basis. In addition, we write contracts on both a prospective basis and a retroactive basis. Prospective reinsurance contracts cover losses incurred as a result of future insurable events. Retroactive reinsurance contracts cover the potential for changes in estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to loss events that have occurred in the past. Retroactive reinsurance contracts can be an attractive type of contract for us as they can generate an underwriting profit should the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses settle for less than the initial estimate of reserves and the premiums received at the inception of the contract generate insurance float. The product lines that we currently underwrite for this operating segment are: property, casualty and specialty. We assume a minimal amount of catastrophe risk within the property and casualty segment. We anticipate that our property catastrophe exposures will consistently remain extremely low when compared to many other reinsurers with whom we compete.\nIn February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc. ( TPRUSA\u201d). The results of Third Point Re USA are reflected in the results of the Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment. Third Point Re USA and TPRUSA have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in their results of operations. As a result, period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy. As a result of Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence, we have expanded our marketing activities and have begun to broaden our profile in the U.S. marketplace. In addition to developing new opportunities, we are strengthening our relationships with existing cedents and brokers. We also intend to continue developing a firsthand understanding of cedent underwriting and claims capabilities that will benefit our underwriting decisions.\nInsurance float is an important aspect of our property and casualty reinsurance operation. In an insurance or reinsurance operation, float arises because premiums from reinsurance contracts and consideration received for deposit accounted c\nontracts are collected before losses are paid on reinsurance contracts and proceeds are returned on deposit accounting contracts. In some instances, the interval between cash receipts and payments can extend over many years. During this time interval, we invest the cash received and seek to generate investment returns. Float is not a concept defined by U.S. GAAP and therefore, there are no comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Float, as a result, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure.\nWe believe that our property and casualty reinsurance segment will contribute to our results by both generating underwriting income as well as generating float. In addition, we expect that float will grow over time as our reinsurance operations expand.\nCatastrophe Risk Management\nIn contrast to many reinsurers with whom we compete, we have elected to limit our underwriting of property catastrophe exposures. Through December 2014, we wrote excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance through the Catastrophe Fund, which was a separately capitalized reinsurance fund vehicle. In December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund and that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Catastrophe Fund distributed $119.4 million (Third Point Re's share - $59.4 million) resulting in a distribution of non-controlling interests for the Catastrophe Fund of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, the Catastrophe Fund had a net asset value of $119.7 million, and our investment in the Catastrophe Fund was $59.5 million.\nInvestment Management\nOur investment strategy is implemented by our investment manager, Third Point LLC, under two long-term investment management contracts. We directly own the investments that are held in two separate accounts and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as Third Point LLC's main hedge funds.\nLimited Operating History and Comparability of Results\nWe were incorporated on October 6, 2011 and completed our initial capitalization on December 22, 2011. We began underwriting business on January 1, 2012. We completed an initial public offering of common shares on August 20, 2013 (the IPO\u201d). As a result, we have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in our results of operations. Period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful.\nIn addition, the amount of premiums written may vary from year to year and from period to period as a result of several factors, including changes in market conditions and our view of the long-term profit potential of individual lines of business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Such measures, including net investment income on float, book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity, are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. We believe these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are referenced below.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that by combining a disciplined and opportunistic approach to reinsurance underwriting with investment results from the active management of our investment portfolio, we will be able to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. The key financial measures that we believe are most meaningful in analyzing our performance are: net underwriting income (loss) for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, combined ratio for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, net investment income (loss), net investment return on investments managed by Third\nPoint LLC, book value per share, diluted book value per share, growth in diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity.\nThe table below shows the key performance indicators for our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\n (1) See Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a calculation of net underwriting loss and combined ratio. \n (2) Book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See reconciliations below.  Net Underwriting Income (Loss) for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nOne way that we evaluate the performance of our property and casualty reinsurance results is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We do not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Net underwriting income or loss is calculated from net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to the underwriting activities.\nCombined Ratio for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nCombined ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net, acquisition costs, net and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities by net premiums earned. The combined ratio compares the amount of net premiums earned to the amount incurred in claims and underwriting related expenses. This ratio is a key indicator of a reinsurance company's profitability. A combined ratio greater than 100% means that loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities exceeded net premiums earned. See additional information in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Investment Income (Loss)\nNet investment income (loss) is an important measure that affects overall profitability. Net investment income (loss) is affected by the performance of Third Point LLC as our exclusive investment manager and the amount of investable cash, or float, generated by our reinsurance operations. Pursuant to our investment management agreements, Third Point LLC is required to manage our investment portfolio on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, subject to certain conditions set forth in our investment guidelines. These conditions include limitations on investing in private securities, a limitation on portfolio leverage, and a limitation on portfolio concentration in individual securities. Our investment management agreements allow us to withdraw cash from our investment account with Third Point LLC at any time with three days' notice to pay claims and with five days' notice to pay expenses.\nWe track excess cash flows generated by our property and casualty reinsurance operations, or float, in separate accounts that allow us to also track the net investment income (loss) generated on the float. We believe that net investment income (loss) generated on float is an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operations to our consolidated results. It is also explicitly considered as part of the evaluation of management's performance for purposes of long-term incentive compensation. Net investment income (loss) on float as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the table below for a reconciliation of net investment income (loss) on float to net investment income (loss).\nNet investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was comprised of the following:\n\nNet Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC\nNet investment return represents the return on our investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our investment assets managed by Third Point LLC, net of non-controlling interests. The stated return is net of withholding taxes, which are presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.\nBook Value Per Share and Diluted Book Value Per Share\nBook value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders by the number of issued and outstanding shares at period end. Diluted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders and adjusted to include unvested restricted shares and the exercise of all in-the-money options and warrants. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Prior to TPRE's initial public offering, the market share price was assumed to be equal to the fully diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings. In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, book value per share decreased by $0.81 per share, or 5.8%, to $13.23 per share from $14.04 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, book value per share increased by $0.56 per share, or 4.2%, to $14.04 per share from $13.48 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, diluted book value per share decreased by $0.70 per share, or 5.2%, to $12.85 per share from $13.55 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, diluted book value per share increased by $0.43 per share, or 3.3%, to $13.55 per share from $13.12 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nThe decrease in basic and diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a net loss during the year as a result of our negative investment return and, to a lesser extent, our underwriting loss in the year. The increase in basic and diluted book value per share for the\nyear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to net income during the year.\nThe diluted book value per share in both years also includes warrants and share compensation issued to our Founders, employees, directors and an advisor, including the additional warrants and options that became exercisable as a result of meeting the performance condition after the IPO.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted book value per share as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 : \n (1) As of December 31, 2015, the effect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees was comprised of 301,043 restricted shares with a service condition only and 536,234 of restricted shares with a service and performance condition that were considered probable of vesting.  Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning of year shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we have adjusted the beginning shareholders' equity for the impact of the issuance of shares in our IPO on a weighted average basis. This adjustment lowers the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity. We believe this metric is used by investors to supplement measures of our profitability.\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was calculated as follows: \nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\n \u2022 premiums from property and casualty reinsurance business assumed; and \n \u2022 income from investments.  Premiums from our property and casualty reinsurance business assumed are directly related to the number, type and pricing of contracts we write. Premiums are earned over the contract period based on the exposure period of the underlying contracts of the ceding company.\nIncome from our investments is primarily comprised of interest income, dividends, and net realized and unrealized gains on investment securities included in our investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\n \u2022 loss and loss adjustment expenses; \n \u2022 acquisition costs; \n \u2022 investment-related expenses; \n \u2022 general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 other expenses; \n \u2022 interest expense; and \n \u2022 income taxes.  Loss and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and loss experience of the underlying coverage. Loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Depending on the nature of the contract, loss and loss adjustment expenses may be paid over a number of years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes and other direct expenses that relate to writing reinsurance contracts and are presented net of commissions ceded under reinsurance contracts. We amortize deferred acquisition costs in the same proportion that the premiums are earned.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees we pay to our investment manager, Third Point LLC, and certain of our Founders and performance fees we pay to TP GP. A 2% management fee calculated on assets under management is paid monthly to Third Point LLC and certain of our Founders, and a performance fee equal to 20% of the net investment income is paid annually to TP GP. We include these expenses in net investment income (loss) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The performance fee is subject to a loss carryforward provision pursuant to which TP GP is required to maintain a Loss Recovery Account, which represents the sum of all prior period net loss amounts, not offset by prior year net profit amounts, and which is allocated to future profit amounts until the Loss Recovery Account has returned to a positive balance. Until such time, no performance fees are payable under the Investment Agreements.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and related payroll costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, share compensation expense, legal and accounting fees, travel and client entertainment, fees relating to our letter of credit facilities, information technology, occupancy and other general operating expenses.\nOther expenses consist of investment credit expenses on deposit liabilities and reinsurance contracts and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in our deposit and reinsurance contracts.\nInterest expense consists of interest expense incurred on TPRUSA's $115.0 million senior unsecured notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in February 2015. The Notes bear interest at 7.0% and interest is payable semi-annually on February 13 and August 13 of each year. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of certain costs incurred in issuing the Notes. These costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in interest expense.\nIncome taxes consist primarily of taxes incurred in the U.S. as a result of our U.S. operations and withholding taxes and uncertain tax positions on certain investment transactions in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting and reporting policies.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimations by management are: (1) premium revenue recognition including evaluation of risk transfer, (2) loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and (3) fair value measurements related to our investments. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying judgments or estimates used by management in the application of these accounting policies, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPremium Revenue Recognition Including Evaluation of Risk Transfer\nFor each contract that we write, we estimate the ultimate premium for the entire contract period and record this estimate at the inception of the contract, to the extent the amount of written premium is estimable. For contracts where the full written premium is not estimable at inception, we record written premium for the portion of the contract period for which the amount is estimable. These estimates are based primarily on information in the underlying contracts as well as information provided by our clients and/or brokers. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on premium revenue recognition.\nChanges in premium estimates are expected and may result in adjustments in any reporting period. These estimates change over time as additional information regarding the underlying business volume is obtained. Along with uncertainty regarding the underlying business volume, our contracts also contain a number of contractual features that can significantly impact the amount of premium that we ultimately recognize. These include commutation provisions, multi-year contracts with cancellation provisions and provisions to return premium at the expiration of the contract in certain circumstances. In certain contracts, these provisions can be exercised by the client, in some cases provisions can be exercised by us and in other cases by mutual consent. In addition, we write a small number of large contracts and the majority of our property and casualty reinsurance segment premiums written to date has been quota share business. As a result, we may be subject to greater volatility around our premium estimates compared to other property and casualty companies. We continuously monitor the premium estimates for each of our contracts considering the cash premiums received, reported premiums, discussions with our clients regarding their premium projections as well as evaluating the potential impact of contractual features. Any subsequent adjustments arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nChanges in premium estimates may not result in a direct impact to net income or shareholders' equity since changes in premium estimates do not necessarily impact the amount of net premiums earned at the time of the premium estimate change and would generally be offset by proportional changes in acquisition costs and net loss and loss adjustment expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $39.3 million of changes in premium estimates on prior years' contracts, (2014 - $(12.1) million 2013 - $(35.7) million). There was an insignificant impact on net income of these changes in premium estimates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The 2015 increases in premium estimates were primarily due to two contracts where the cedants reported writing significantly more business than initially expected. The 2014 decreases in premium estimates were primarily due to contracts where the clients reported writing less business than initially expected. The 2013 changes in premium estimates were primarily due to return premiums on contracts that expired in 2013 and that included a contractual provision to return the unearned premiums at expiration.\nDetermining whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to recognizing premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial pricing models and assumptions and evaluating contractual features that could impact the determination of whether a contract meets risk transfer. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we use deposit\naccounting. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on deposit contracts entered into to date.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOur loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not yet reported ( IBNR reserves\u201d) and deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Case reserves are established for losses that have been reported, but not yet paid, based on loss reports from brokers and ceding companies. IBNR reserves represent the estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown future developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses that are known to us. IBNR reserves are established by management based on actuarially determined estimates of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred gains represent the underwriting profit related to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts at inception and are deferred and amortized over the estimated future payout of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Any underwriting loss at inception related to retroactive exposures in a reinsurance contract is recognized immediately.\nInherent in the estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. Accordingly, ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the period in which they become known.\nWe perform an actuarial projection of our reserves quarterly and have a third-party actuarial review performed annually.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ( Annual Report\u201d).\nThe statements in this discussion regarding business outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to our Introductory Note to this Annual Report and the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company domiciled in Bermuda. Through our reinsurance subsidiaries, we provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies on a worldwide basis. Our goal is to deliver attractive equity returns to our shareholders by combining profitable reinsurance underwriting with superior investment management provided by Third Point LLC, our investment manager. We believe that our reinsurance and investment strategy differentiates us from our competitors.\nWe manage our business on the basis of two operating segments: Property and Casualty Reinsurance and Catastrophe Risk Management. We also have a corporate function that includes our investment income on capital, certain general and administrative expenses related to corporate activities, interest expense and income tax expense.\nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance\nWe provide reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies, government entities, and other risk bearing vehicles. Contracts can be written on an excess of loss basis or quota share basis, although the majority of contracts written to date have been on a quota share basis. In addition, we write contracts on both a prospective basis and a retroactive basis. Prospective reinsurance contracts cover losses incurred as a result of future insurable events. Retroactive reinsurance contracts cover the potential for changes in estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to loss events that have occurred in the past. Retroactive reinsurance contracts can be an attractive type of contract for us as they can generate an underwriting profit should the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses settle for less than the initial estimate of reserves and the premiums received at the inception of the contract generate insurance float. The product lines that we currently underwrite for this operating segment are: property, casualty and specialty. We assume a minimal amount of catastrophe risk within the property and casualty segment. We anticipate that our property catastrophe exposures will consistently remain extremely low when compared to many other reinsurers with whom we compete.\nIn February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc. ( TPRUSA\u201d). The results of Third Point Re USA are reflected in the results of the Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment. Third Point Re USA and TPRUSA have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in their results of operations. As a result, period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy. As a result of Third Point Re USA's U.S. presence, we have expanded our marketing activities and have begun to broaden our profile in the U.S. marketplace. In addition to developing new opportunities, we are strengthening our relationships with existing cedents and brokers. We also intend to continue developing a firsthand understanding of cedent underwriting and claims capabilities that will benefit our underwriting decisions.\nInsurance float is an important aspect of our property and casualty reinsurance operation. In an insurance or reinsurance operation, float arises because premiums from reinsurance contracts and consideration received for deposit accounted c\nontracts are collected before losses are paid on reinsurance contracts and proceeds are returned on deposit accounting contracts. In some instances, the interval between cash receipts and payments can extend over many years. During this time interval, we invest the cash received and seek to generate investment returns. Float is not a concept defined by U.S. GAAP and therefore, there are no comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Float, as a result, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure.\nWe believe that our property and casualty reinsurance segment will contribute to our results by both generating underwriting income as well as generating float. In addition, we expect that float will grow over time as our reinsurance operations expand.\nCatastrophe Risk Management\nIn contrast to many reinsurers with whom we compete, we have elected to limit our underwriting of property catastrophe exposures. Through December 2014, we wrote excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance through the Catastrophe Fund, which was a separately capitalized reinsurance fund vehicle. In December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund and that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Catastrophe Fund distributed $119.4 million (Third Point Re's share - $59.4 million) resulting in a distribution of non-controlling interests for the Catastrophe Fund of $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, the Catastrophe Fund had a net asset value of $119.7 million, and our investment in the Catastrophe Fund was $59.5 million.\nInvestment Management\nOur investment strategy is implemented by our investment manager, Third Point LLC, under two long-term investment management contracts. We directly own the investments that are held in two separate accounts and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as Third Point LLC's main hedge funds.\nLimited Operating History and Comparability of Results\nWe were incorporated on October 6, 2011 and completed our initial capitalization on December 22, 2011. We began underwriting business on January 1, 2012. We completed an initial public offering of common shares on August 20, 2013 (the IPO\u201d). As a result, we have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in our results of operations. Period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful.\nIn addition, the amount of premiums written may vary from year to year and from period to period as a result of several factors, including changes in market conditions and our view of the long-term profit potential of individual lines of business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Such measures, including net investment income on float, book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity, are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. We believe these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are referenced below.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that by combining a disciplined and opportunistic approach to reinsurance underwriting with investment results from the active management of our investment portfolio, we will be able to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. The key financial measures that we believe are most meaningful in analyzing our performance are: net underwriting income (loss) for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, combined ratio for our property and casualty reinsurance segment, net investment income (loss), net investment return on investments managed by Third\nPoint LLC, book value per share, diluted book value per share, growth in diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity.\nThe table below shows the key performance indicators for our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands, except for per share data and ratios)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key underwriting metrics for Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net underwriting loss (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,552\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio (1)\n</td> <td>104.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key investment return metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key shareholders' value creation metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in diluted book value per share (2)\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on beginning shareholders' equity (2)\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a calculation of net underwriting loss and combined ratio. \n (2) Book value per share, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. See reconciliations below.  Net Underwriting Income (Loss) for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nOne way that we evaluate the performance of our property and casualty reinsurance results is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We do not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Net underwriting income or loss is calculated from net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to the underwriting activities.\nCombined Ratio for Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nCombined ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net, acquisition costs, net and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities by net premiums earned. The combined ratio compares the amount of net premiums earned to the amount incurred in claims and underwriting related expenses. This ratio is a key indicator of a reinsurance company's profitability. A combined ratio greater than 100% means that loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses related to underwriting activities exceeded net premiums earned. See additional information in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Investment Income (Loss)\nNet investment income (loss) is an important measure that affects overall profitability. Net investment income (loss) is affected by the performance of Third Point LLC as our exclusive investment manager and the amount of investable cash, or float, generated by our reinsurance operations. Pursuant to our investment management agreements, Third Point LLC is required to manage our investment portfolio on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, subject to certain conditions set forth in our investment guidelines. These conditions include limitations on investing in private securities, a limitation on portfolio leverage, and a limitation on portfolio concentration in individual securities. Our investment management agreements allow us to withdraw cash from our investment account with Third Point LLC at any time with three days' notice to pay claims and with five days' notice to pay expenses.\nWe track excess cash flows generated by our property and casualty reinsurance operations, or float, in separate accounts that allow us to also track the net investment income (loss) generated on the float. We believe that net investment income (loss) generated on float is an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operations to our consolidated results. It is also explicitly considered as part of the evaluation of management's performance for purposes of long-term incentive compensation. Net investment income (loss) on float as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the table below for a reconciliation of net investment income (loss) on float to net investment income (loss).\nNet investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was comprised of the following:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on float\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,810\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on capital\n</td> <td>(18,798\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss) on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n</td> <td>(29,608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income on cash held by the Catastrophe Reinsurer and Catastrophe Fund\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on catastrophe bond held by Catastrophe Reinsurer\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on investment in Kiskadee Fund\n</td> <td>1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on reinsurance contract derivatives written by the Catastrophe Reinsurer\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC\nNet investment return represents the return on our investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our investment assets managed by Third Point LLC, net of non-controlling interests. The stated return is net of withholding taxes, which are presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.\nBook Value Per Share and Diluted Book Value Per Share\nBook value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders by the number of issued and outstanding shares at period end. Diluted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders and adjusted to include unvested restricted shares and the exercise of all in-the-money options and warrants. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Prior to TPRE's initial public offering, the market share price was assumed to be equal to the fully diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings. In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, book value per share decreased by $0.81 per share, or 5.8%, to $13.23 per share from $14.04 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, book value per share increased by $0.56 per share, or 4.2%, to $14.04 per share from $13.48 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, diluted book value per share decreased by $0.70 per share, or 5.2%, to $12.85 per share from $13.55 per share as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, diluted book value per share increased by $0.43 per share, or 3.3%, to $13.55 per share from $13.12 per share as of December 31, 2013.\nThe decrease in basic and diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a net loss during the year as a result of our negative investment return and, to a lesser extent, our underwriting loss in the year. The increase in basic and diluted book value per share for the\nyear ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to net income during the year.\nThe diluted book value per share in both years also includes warrants and share compensation issued to our Founders, employees, directors and an advisor, including the additional warrants and options that became exercisable as a result of meeting the performance condition after the IPO.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted book value per share as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 : Table 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted book value per share numerator:\n</td> <td>($ in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,395,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,552,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,510,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(16,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders\n</td> <td>1,379,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive warrants issued to Founders and an advisor\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive share options issued to directors and employees\n</td> <td>58,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share numerator:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,484,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,560,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted book value per share denominator:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued and outstanding shares\n</td> <td>104,256,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,397,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,264,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive warrants issued to Founders and an advisor\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,651,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive share options issued to directors and employees\n</td> <td>5,788,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,151,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,784,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees (1)\n</td> <td>837,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>922,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share denominator:\n</td> <td>115,533,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,123,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,357,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic book value per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted book value per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) As of December 31, 2015, the effect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees was comprised of 301,043 restricted shares with a service condition only and 536,234 of restricted shares with a service and performance condition that were considered probable of vesting.  Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning of year shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we have adjusted the beginning shareholders' equity for the impact of the issuance of shares in our IPO on a weighted average basis. This adjustment lowers the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity. We believe this metric is used by investors to supplement measures of our profitability.\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was calculated as follows: Table 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders - beginning of year\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>868,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of weighting related to shareholders' equity from IPO\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted shareholders' equity attributable to shareholders - beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,451,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on beginning shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\n \u2022 premiums from property and casualty reinsurance business assumed; and \n \u2022 income from investments.  Premiums from our property and casualty reinsurance business assumed are directly related to the number, type and pricing of contracts we write. Premiums are earned over the contract period based on the exposure period of the underlying contracts of the ceding company.\nIncome from our investments is primarily comprised of interest income, dividends, and net realized and unrealized gains on investment securities included in our investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\n \u2022 loss and loss adjustment expenses; \n \u2022 acquisition costs; \n \u2022 investment-related expenses; \n \u2022 general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 other expenses; \n \u2022 interest expense; and \n \u2022 income taxes.  Loss and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and loss experience of the underlying coverage. Loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Depending on the nature of the contract, loss and loss adjustment expenses may be paid over a number of years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes and other direct expenses that relate to writing reinsurance contracts and are presented net of commissions ceded under reinsurance contracts. We amortize deferred acquisition costs in the same proportion that the premiums are earned.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees we pay to our investment manager, Third Point LLC, and certain of our Founders and performance fees we pay to TP GP. A 2% management fee calculated on assets under management is paid monthly to Third Point LLC and certain of our Founders, and a performance fee equal to 20% of the net investment income is paid annually to TP GP. We include these expenses in net investment income (loss) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The performance fee is subject to a loss carryforward provision pursuant to which TP GP is required to maintain a Loss Recovery Account, which represents the sum of all prior period net loss amounts, not offset by prior year net profit amounts, and which is allocated to future profit amounts until the Loss Recovery Account has returned to a positive balance. Until such time, no performance fees are payable under the Investment Agreements.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and related payroll costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, share compensation expense, legal and accounting fees, travel and client entertainment, fees relating to our letter of credit facilities, information technology, occupancy and other general operating expenses.\nOther expenses consist of investment credit expenses on deposit liabilities and reinsurance contracts and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in our deposit and reinsurance contracts.\nInterest expense consists of interest expense incurred on TPRUSA's $115.0 million senior unsecured notes (the Notes\u201d) issued in February 2015. The Notes bear interest at 7.0% and interest is payable semi-annually on February 13 and August 13 of each year. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of certain costs incurred in issuing the Notes. These costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in interest expense.\nIncome taxes consist primarily of taxes incurred in the U.S. as a result of our U.S. operations and withholding taxes and uncertain tax positions on certain investment transactions in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting and reporting policies.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimations by management are: (1) premium revenue recognition including evaluation of risk transfer, (2) loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and (3) fair value measurements related to our investments. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying judgments or estimates used by management in the application of these accounting policies, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPremium Revenue Recognition Including Evaluation of Risk Transfer\nFor each contract that we write, we estimate the ultimate premium for the entire contract period and record this estimate at the inception of the contract, to the extent the amount of written premium is estimable. For contracts where the full written premium is not estimable at inception, we record written premium for the portion of the contract period for which the amount is estimable. These estimates are based primarily on information in the underlying contracts as well as information provided by our clients and/or brokers. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on premium revenue recognition.\nChanges in premium estimates are expected and may result in adjustments in any reporting period. These estimates change over time as additional information regarding the underlying business volume is obtained. Along with uncertainty regarding the underlying business volume, our contracts also contain a number of contractual features that can significantly impact the amount of premium that we ultimately recognize. These include commutation provisions, multi-year contracts with cancellation provisions and provisions to return premium at the expiration of the contract in certain circumstances. In certain contracts, these provisions can be exercised by the client, in some cases provisions can be exercised by us and in other cases by mutual consent. In addition, we write a small number of large contracts and the majority of our property and casualty reinsurance segment premiums written to date has been quota share business. As a result, we may be subject to greater volatility around our premium estimates compared to other property and casualty companies. We continuously monitor the premium estimates for each of our contracts considering the cash premiums received, reported premiums, discussions with our clients regarding their premium projections as well as evaluating the potential impact of contractual features. Any subsequent adjustments arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nChanges in premium estimates may not result in a direct impact to net income or shareholders' equity since changes in premium estimates do not necessarily impact the amount of net premiums earned at the time of the premium estimate change and would generally be offset by proportional changes in acquisition costs and net loss and loss adjustment expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $39.3 million of changes in premium estimates on prior years' contracts, (2014 - $(12.1) million 2013 - $(35.7) million). There was an insignificant impact on net income of these changes in premium estimates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The 2015 increases in premium estimates were primarily due to two contracts where the cedants reported writing significantly more business than initially expected. The 2014 decreases in premium estimates were primarily due to contracts where the clients reported writing less business than initially expected. The 2013 changes in premium estimates were primarily due to return premiums on contracts that expired in 2013 and that included a contractual provision to return the unearned premiums at expiration.\nDetermining whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to recognizing premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial pricing models and assumptions and evaluating contractual features that could impact the determination of whether a contract meets risk transfer. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we use deposit\naccounting. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on deposit contracts entered into to date.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOur loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not yet reported ( IBNR reserves\u201d) and deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Case reserves are established for losses that have been reported, but not yet paid, based on loss reports from brokers and ceding companies. IBNR reserves represent the estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown future developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses that are known to us. IBNR reserves are established by management based on actuarially determined estimates of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred gains represent the underwriting profit related to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts at inception and are deferred and amortized over the estimated future payout of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Any underwriting loss at inception related to retroactive exposures in a reinsurance contract is recognized immediately.\nInherent in the estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. Accordingly, ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the period in which they become known.\nWe perform an actuarial projection of our reserves quarterly and have a third-party actuarial review performed annually."}
