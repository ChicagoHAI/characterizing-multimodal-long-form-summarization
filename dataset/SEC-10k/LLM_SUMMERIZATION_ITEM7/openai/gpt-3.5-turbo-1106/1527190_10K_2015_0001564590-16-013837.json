Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs discussed in Part 1, some of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d), as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, may constitute forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements\u201d by the specific words, including but not limited to may,\u201d should,\u201d expects,\u201d plans,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d predicts,\u201d potential\u201d or continue\u201d or the negative of those words and other comparable words. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nOverview\nNCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre video advertising network in North America, through which it distributes national and local advertising that the Company has sold on theatre screens and video screens in theatre lobbies. NCM LLC also sells theatre lobby promotions and online and mobile advertising that are displayed on its and other publisher websites and mobile sites and apps. Our revenue is principally derived from advertising distributed to NCM LLC's founding member theatres in accordance with long-term ESAs (over 21 years remaining as of December 31, 2015) and to network affiliates in accordance with multi-year agreements, which expire at various dates through July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 19.0 years as of December 31, 2015. The ESAs with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theatres to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our advertising FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is generated by theatres connected to our DCN (the remaining 601 screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings twice per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local/regional advertising rate per screen per week, local/regional and total advertising revenue per attendee, as well as, our free cash flow, dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA) and cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn December 26, 2013, we sold our Fathom Events business to a newly formed limited liability company (AC JV, LLC) owned 32% by each of the founding members and 4% by us. The Fathom Events business focused on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to theatre operators to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule. In consideration for the sale, we received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from our founding members (one-third from each founding member). Refer to Note 2 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, the Company announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. This payment was $2 million lower than the reverse termination fee contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data). Refer to Item 6.

In connection with the offering, NCM, Inc. purchased newly issued common membership units from NCM LLC and common membership units from our founding members, and became a member of and the sole manager of NCM LLC. We entered into several agreements to effect the reorganization and the financing transaction and certain amendments were made to the existing ESAs to govern the relationships among NCM LLC and our founding members after the completion of these transactions.\nThe results of operations data discussed herein were derived from the audited financial statements and accounting records of NCM LLC and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto.\nWe have a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25. Fiscal year 2014 contained 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2013 and 2015 contained 52 weeks. Our 2016 fiscal year will contain 52 weeks.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational advertising revenue. The $50.7 million, or 19.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from NCM LLC's founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theatre attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $10.2 million, or 10.5%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from NCM LLC's founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 14.4% decrease in beverage revenue CPMs and a decrease of 0.4% in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The 2015 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2013 to 2014, which decreased 14.4%. Founding member beverage revenue also decreased by $2.7 million due to one of NCM LLC's founding members reducing the length of the beverage advertising unit from 60 seconds to 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015.

Advertising operating costs increased $4.4 million, or 16.7%, from $26.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $3.6 million increase in affiliate advertising payments which was driven by higher national and local advertising revenue and a 3.5% increase in the number of average affiliate screens for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.5 million, or 2.7%, from $18.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower salaries due to department realignment, partially offset by higher bonus expense due to improved performance against targets compared to 2014.\nTheatre access fees-founding members. Theatre access fees increased $1.9 million, or 2.7%, from $70.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $2.0 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. These fees increased $1.3 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.7 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment. This increase of $2.0 million was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in attendance related fees due to a 0.4% decrease in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $14.7 million, or 25.5%, from $57.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to\nan increase of $8.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense, higher commission expense and higher bonus expense, all primarily related to better performance against targets and higher revenue compared to 2014. Selling and marketing costs also increased due to an increase of $2.1 million in bad debt expense due to a smaller reserve in 2014 compared to 2015 and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash barter expense.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $2.1 million, or 10.9%, from $19.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014.\nAdministrative fee - managing member. Administrative fee-managing member increased $7.0 million, or 68.6%, from $10.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to personnel-related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014. Amounts recorded are based on the terms of the management services agreement which states NCM LLC pays NCM, Inc. service fees which are equal to the cost of NCM, Inc. employees and any reimbursable costs incurred by NCM, Inc.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from $32.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related to new affiliate agreements and NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. Merger-related costs were $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and $15.0 million in legal, accounting and advisory fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 14.8%, from $62.1 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net income decreased $8.8 million from $96.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in operating income of $18.7 million, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in non-operating expenses of $9.2 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $0.7 million.\nYears Ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013\nRevenue.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational advertising revenue. The $36.2 million, or 12.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from our founding members) was driven by a 16.4% decrease in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) due primarily to a soft television scatter marketplace, the increase in competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our client mix to new client industries that traditionally buy their television and other advertising at lower CPMs. National advertising revenue also decreased due to a decline in revenue by our content partners and scatter spending by our previous cell phone PSA client, which decreased $5.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively, compared to 2013. The decline in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue) was partially offset by an increase in utilized impressions of 4.0% in 2014 compared to 2013. Our national inventory utilization rose from 109.3% for the year ended December 26, 2013 to 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015, primarily due to an overall expansion of our client base and the success of the October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015 upfront selling campaign that positively impacted the fourth quarter of 2014. The number of advertising impressions decreased due to a 1.6% year-over-year decrease in theatre attendance, resulting from a weaker film release schedule compared to 2013, partially offset by an additional week in our 53-week year, compared to a 52-week year in 2013. Inventory utilization is calculated based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $6.9 million, or 7.7%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase in local advertising contract volume of 7.9%, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average contract value of 0.3% for the year ended January 1, 2015, compared to the year ended December 26, 2013.\nThe increase in contract volume was driven primarily by the higher number of larger regional contracts (greater than $250,000), which grew 64% due to the improving economy that benefited smaller businesses that make smaller advertising commitments and the continued expansion of the number of theatres in our network. While the number of our largest contracts grew (those over $250,000), the number of contracts between $50,000 and $250,000 declined 6.8%.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $3.0 million, or 7.2%, decrease in national advertising revenue from our founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 5.8% decrease in beverage revenue CPMs and a 1.6% decrease in founding member attendance for the year ended January 1, 2015, compared to the year ended December 26, 2013. The 2014 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM of segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2012 to 2013, which decreased 5.8%.\nFathom Events revenue. Fathom Events revenue was zero for the year ended January 1, 2015 from $36.5 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 due to the sale of this portion of our business on December 26, 2013.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended January 1, 2015 were $234.8 million, a decrease of 10.0%, from $260.8 million for the 2013 period.

Advertising operating costs decreased $2.6 million, or 9.0%, from $29.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $26.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a $1.0 million decrease in affiliate advertising payments, a $0.8 million decrease in on-screen production costs and a $0.5 million decrease in lobby production supplies, partially offset by the impact of an additional week in 2014. The decrease in affiliate advertising payments was driven by lower total advertising revenue and a 0.5% decrease in the number of average affiliate screens for the year ended January 1, 2015, compared to the year ended December 26, 2013 due primarily to acquisitions by the founding members of network affiliates in 2013. Lobby production supplies and on-screen production costs decreased due to lower revenue during the period.\nFathom Events operating costs. Fathom Events operating costs were zero for the year ended January 1, 2015 from $25.5 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 due to the sale of this portion of our business on December 26, 2013.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.4 million, or 2.1%, from $18.7 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $18.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.3 million in equipment rental and network maintenance costs, partially offset by the impact of an additional week in 2014, and a decrease of $0.2 million for reimbursement of AC JV, LLC transition costs.\nTheatre access fees-founding members. Theatre access fees increased $1.2 million, or 1.7%, from $69.4 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $70.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase was due to a $2.0 million increase in theatre access fees due to an increase in the number of digital screens (connected to DCN), including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease related to the 1.6% decrease in founding member attendance in 2014 compared to 2013. The fees for digital screens and equipment increased $1.2 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.8 million from an increase of 2.5% in the average number of founding member digital screens and an increase of 3.8% in the average number of founding member theatres equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment year-over-\nyear. The increases in digital screens and theatres with digital cinema equipment were due primarily to acquisitions by the founding members.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs decreased $3.9 million, or 6.3%, from $61.5 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $57.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of $2.2 million as actual advertising accounts receivable write-offs were lower than estimated, a decrease of $1.6 million in non-cash barter expense related to timing of barter transactions and a decrease of $0.6 million in certain discretionary marketing expenses. These decreases to selling and marketing costs were partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million in personnel expense due primarily to higher share-based compensation expense and local commissions, partially offset by lower salaries, bonuses and related taxes (related to lower performance against internal targets) and lower benefit costs.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs decreased $0.8 million, or 4.0%, from $20.1 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $19.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.3 million in legal and professional expenses, as well as, decreases in personnel costs, contract labor and building related expenses.\nAdministrative fee - managing member. Administrative fee-managing member increased $0.2 million, or 2.0%, from $10.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $10.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. Amounts recorded are based on the terms of the management services agreement which states NCM LLC pays NCM, Inc. service fees which are equal to the cost of NCM, Inc. employees and any reimbursable costs incurred by NCM, Inc.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5.8 million, or 21.8%, from $26.6 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $32.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets related to new affiliate agreements and NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments, primarily related to founding member theatre acquisitions and the impact of an additional week in 2014.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses increased $23.7 million, or 61.7%, from $38.4 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $62.1 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the years ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 (in millions):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of terminated derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of Fathom Events - founding members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM = Not meaningful.\nThe increase in non-operating expense was due primarily to the absence of the gain recorded in 2013 of $25.4 million, net of direct expenses, related to the sale of our Fathom Events business on December 26, 2013. In addition, interest on borrowings increased $1.0 million due to an additional week in our 53-week year, compared to a 52-week year in 2013. The increase in non-operating expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $1.2 million due primarily to interest accrued on the notes receivable from the founding members from the sale of Fathom Events and the absence of a $0.8 million impairment of an investment recorded in 2013.\nNet income. Net income decreased $66.6 million from $162.9 million for the year ended December 26, 2013 to $96.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in operating income of $42.8 million that was due primarily to the decrease in our national advertising revenue and was negatively impacted by the sale of the Fathom Events business and an increase of $23.7 million in non-operating expense, as described further above.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nTrends and Uncertainties Related to our Business, Industry and Corporate Structure\nChanges in the current macro-economic environment and changes in the national, regional and local advertising markets, including increased competition related to the expansion of online and mobile advertising platforms, present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients. The impact to our business associated with these issues could be mitigated somewhat over time due to factors including the increase in salable advertising impressions and better geographic coverage related to the expansion of our network, diversification and growth of our advertising client base and improvements in the technical quality of our network and upgrades to our inventory management and data management systems that allow us to better target theatre audiences and provide more robust analytics to our clients. We could also benefit if the effectiveness of cinema advertising improves relative to other advertising mediums if consumer viewing habits shift to smaller less effective mobile devices and television ratings decline and it becomes less effective as a marketing platform due to the time-shifting of programming and related ad-skipping associated with the increasing use of DVRs by consumers and as programming shifts to online video platforms. The impact of these consumer and media market trends appear to have had a favorable impact on our level of national upfront bookings. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming year, and by committing to purchase in advance, lock in inventory placement and the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising closer to the scheduled run time. We believe that over time, this greater shift toward more upfront commitments, allows us to bundle several client flights throughout the year and stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter CPM volatility by increasing overall inventory utilization and balancing that utilization throughout the year. We believe this greater pricing and placement flexibility has helped to increase our share of video advertising spending by increasing the number of clients and client industries that buy our network. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase that could reduce what is ultimately spent by clients that have made upfront commitments and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.\nThe net screens added to our network by our founding members and network affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2015 were as follows.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of screens\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Founding Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Network Affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of January 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New affiliates (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net openings/closures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition of Starplex network affiliate by founding member\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> An additional 142 screens joined our network in the first quarter of 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect this expansion of our network and additional attendees will provide our advertising clients with a better marketing product with increased reach (more advertising impressions) and improved geographic coverage. During 2016, we also plan to offer our advertising clients better audience targeting capabilities and more robust campaign data analytics that are expected to assist with our strategy to provide a better product offering to advertisers and thus expand our overall national client base. We also believe that the continued growth of our market coverage ubiquity and overall number of impressions will strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning against other national, regional and local video advertising platforms, including television, online and mobile video platforms and other out of home video advertising platforms.\nIn 2014, we experienced a decline of 16.4%, in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) compared to the prior period due primarily to the increased competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, television networks and other out-of-home video networks and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our inventory utilization related to the addition of new client categories that traditionally buy their television advertising at lower CPMs. After the resetting of our pricing over the last few years to be more attractive to a broader number of potential clients and reflect seasonal marketplace supply and demand characteristics, during 2015, we experienced an increase of 6.7% in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue). Volatility in quarterly national CPMs combined with an increase in national inventory utilization reflects the\nsuccess of our upfront inventory packaging strategy that created multi-flight campaigns for clients that were priced based on lower market demand in select weeks throughout the year that generally coincided with fewer large films and lower overall theatre attendance. As a result of this new packaging strategy and more dynamic upfront and scatter pricing that is responsive to week-to-week market demand and inventory availability, we expect our national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) to continue to be higher during higher market demand periods and lower during periods of lower market demand where we have greater amounts of unsold inventory.\nUnder the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the FirstLook program can be sold to NCM LLC's founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. During 2014 and in the first six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to our founding members. Beginning July 1, 2015, one of our founding members reduced their beverage advertising from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. We have the right to sell the 30 second unit to other clients. The other founding members' current long-term contracts with their beverage suppliers require 60 seconds of beverage advertising, although such commitments could change in the future. Should the amount of time acquired as part of these beverage concessionaire agreements decline with the other founding members, this premium time will be available for sale to other clients. Per the ESAs, the time sold to the founding member beverage supplier is priced equal to the advertising CPM for the previous year charged by us to unaffiliated third parties during segment one (closest to showtime) of the FirstLook pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by us, which in 2015 increased 5.7%. Thus, the CPM on our beverage concessionaire revenue in 2016 will increase by 5.7%, compared to 2015.\nIn consideration for our access to founding members' theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of lobbies and other space within the founding members' theatres for the LEN and lobby promotions, the founding members receive a monthly theatre access fee under the ESAs. The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen (connected to the DCN). The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the next increase taking effect for fiscal year 2017, and the payment per digital screen increases annually by 5%. The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to all founding members cannot be less than 12% of our aggregate advertising revenue (as defined in the ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment. Pursuant to ESAs, the theatre access fee paid to the members of NCM LLC included an additional fee for access to the higher quality digital cinema systems. This additional fee will continue to increase as additional screens are equipped with the new digital cinema equipment and the fee increases annually by 5%. As of December 31, 2015, 96% of our founding member network screens were showing advertising on digital cinema projectors, and thus the future impact on the theatre access fee related to additional digital cinema installations within existing founding member theatres is expected to be minimal.\nDuring 2015, we reduced the length of our content partner entertainment programming segments from two and one-half minutes to two minutes in content partner agreements representing about 50% of our FirstLook pre-show impressions. During 2016, all of our content partner agreements will provide for two minute entertainment content segments. The reduction in the length of our FirstLook content partner entertainment segments from two and one-half minutes to two minutes provided two additional 30-second national units and one additional local or regional advertising unit for us to sell across approximately 50% of our network impressions in 2015 and will provide for these additional segments across 100% of our network impressions in 2016. Because there is no reduction in our revenue from reducing these content segments, this will provide additional salable national, local and regional FirstLook pre-show inventory that could allow us to increase our future advertising revenue provided that there is adequate market demand.\nTrends and Uncertainties Related to Liquidity and Financial Performance\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, we amended our senior secured credit facility to extend the maturity, expand the revolver availability and reduce the interest rate spreads. In 2012 and 2011, we issued new Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes primarily to refinance outstanding bank debt. As a result of these transactions, we extended the average maturities of our debt and as of December 31, 2015, the average remaining maturity of our debt is 5.3 years. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 64% of our outstanding borrowings bear interest at fixed rates. The remaining 36% of our outstanding borrowings bear interest at variable rates and as such, our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate with interest rate fluctuations related to our borrowings. Refer to Note 8 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nAs described within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d, on March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced the termination of the Merger Agreement with Screenvision. We do not expect to incur additional material expenses related to the terminated merger.\nTrends Related to Ownership in NCM LLC\nIn accordance with our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with our founding members, on an annual basis we determines the amount of common membership units to be issued to or returned by the founding members based on theatre additions or dispositions during the previous year. During the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, we issued 2,160,915 and 1,087,911 common membership units to its founding members, respectively, for the rights to exclusive access to the theatre screens and attendees added, net of dispositions by the founding members to our network during the previous year. We recorded a net intangible asset of $31.4 million and $16.4 million during the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the Common Unit Adjustments.\nOur Common Unit Adjustment Agreement also requires that a Common Unit Adjustment occur for a specific founding member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent Common Unit Adjustment, results in an attendance increase or decrease in excess of two percent of the annual total attendance at the prior adjustment date. In December 2015, NCM LLC issued 4,399,324 common membership units to AMC for attendees added in connection with AMC's acquisition of Starplex Cinemas and other newly built or acquired theatres.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, AMC exercised the redemption right of an aggregate 200,000 common membership units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc.'s common stock. Refer to Note 7 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nLiquidity\nOur cash balances can fluctuate due to the seasonality of our business and related timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments, as well as, available cash payments (as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement) to our founding members and managing member, interest or principal payments on our term loan and the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes.\nA summary of our financial liquidity is as follows (in millions):\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2013 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolver availability (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The revolving credit facility portion of our total borrowings is available, subject to certain conditions, for general corporate purposes of NCM LLC in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the senior secured credit facility, and a portion is available for letters of credit. Our total availability under the revolving credit facility is $135.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $51.2 million decrease in liquidity as of December 31, 2015, compared to January 1, 2015, was due primarily to the funding of the merger termination fee of $26.8 million and related merger costs of approximately $15.0 million. The mandatory distributions of available cash by us to our founding members and NCM, Inc. for the three months ended April 2, 2015 was calculated as negative $25.5 million due to the merger termination fee and related expenses. Therefore, there was no payment made in the second quarter of 2015. Under the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement, this negative amount will be netted against the available cash distributions for the second quarter of 2016, which will be paid in the third quarter of 2016. Until the settlement in the third quarter of 2016, the remaining merger-related costs will be funded through borrowings on the revolving credit facility.\nWe have generated and used cash as follows (in millions):\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 26, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (103.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (139.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (146.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015\nOperating Activities. The $35.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable due to higher revenue and timing of collections in the period.\nInvesting Activities. The $3.6 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to an increase of approximately $3.9 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2015.\nFinancing Activities. The $35.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to $42.0 million greater proceeds from borrowings, net of repayments, due to higher borrowings on the revolving credit facility to pay the merger termination fee and related merger costs, as described above, partially offset by a $8.2 million decrease in distributions to our members.\nCash Flows - Years Ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013\nOperating Activities. The $25.1 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended January 1, 2015 versus the year ended December 26, 2013 was due primarily to the $40.6 million decrease in net income (not including the $26.0 million noncash gain on the sale of Fathom Events during 2013) and a $16.0 decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to lower expenses and timing of payments, partially offset by a $24.7 million smaller change in accounts receivable period over period primarily due to lower revenue and timing of collections in the period.\nInvesting Activities. The $11.5 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended January 1, 2015 compared to the year ended December 26, 2013 was due primarily to a decrease of approximately $5.9 million in affiliate payments for the upfront fees paid upon commencement of certain network affiliate agreements and an increase of approximately $4.2 million in proceeds from notes receivable from the founding members related to the sale of the Fathom Events business.\nFinancing Activities. The $7.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended January 1, 2015 compared to the year ended December 26, 2013 was due primarily to a decrease of approximately $33.3 million in distributions to our founding members and managing member, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $19.5 million in proceeds from the settlement of share-based compensation and a decrease in cash proceeds from borrowings, net of payments, of approximately $9.0 million.\nSources of Capital and Capital Requirements\nOur primary source of liquidity and capital resources includes cash from operations, availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Refer to Note 8 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document and Financings\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the debt transactions in 2014 and 2015.\nManagement believes that future funds generated from our operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, our debt service requirements, and capital expenditure and other investing requirements, through the next twelve months. Cash flows can be impacted by the seasonality of advertising sales, stock option exercises, interest on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and to a lesser extent theatre attendance. We are required pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement to distribute our available cash, as defined in the operating agreement,\nquarterly to our members (the founding members and NCM, Inc.). The available cash distribution to the members of NCM LLC for the three months ended April 2, 2015 was calculated as negative $25.5 million due to the merger termination fee and related merger costs. Pursuant to the NCM LLC Operating Agreement, there was no distribution made in the second quarter of 2015 and the negative amount will be netted against available cash distributions for the second quarter of 2016, which will be paid in the third quarter of 2016. The available cash distribution to the members of NCM LLC for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $148.5 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur Capital expenditures have typically been capitalized software upgrades for our DCS and advertising proposal and inventory management and audience targeting and data management systems being developed primarily by our programmers and outside consultants, equipment required for our NOC and content production and post-production facilities, office leasehold improvements, desktop equipment for use by our employees, and in certain cases, the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate's theatres when they are added to our network. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $13.0 million (including $1.1 million associated with network affiliate additions) compared to $8.8 million (including $1.6 million associated with network affiliate additions) for the 2014 period. The capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations. All capital expenditures related to the DCN within our founding members' theatres have been made by our founding members under the ESAs. We expect they will continue to be made by our founding members in accordance with the ESAs.\nWe expect to make approximately $14.0 million to $15.0 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, primarily for upgrades to our DCS distribution and content management software and our other internal management systems, including our proposal, inventory and audience targeting and data management systems, reporting systems, server and storage upgrades, software licensing, our internet site, mobile app and network equipment related to currently contracted network affiliate theatres. We expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems, which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients, should enhance our operating efficiencies, including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory, create more targeted buys and provide more robust campaign data for our advertising clients to help drive future growth. Our capital expenditures may increase should we decide to add additional network affiliates to our network. We expect that additional expenditures, if any, would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates. The commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in Contractual and Other Obligations\u201d below.\nFinancings\nAs of December 31, 2015, our senior secured credit facility consisted of a $135.0 million revolving credit facility and a $270.0 million term loan. On June 18, 2014, we entered into an incremental amendment of our senior secured credit facility whereby the revolving credit facility was increased by $25.0 million. In addition, on July 2, 2014, we entered into an amendment of our senior secured credit facility whereby the maturity date was extended by two years to November 26, 2019, which corresponds to the maturity date of the $270 million term loans. On December 31, 2014, $14.0 million of the revolving credit facility matured and NCM LLC paid the balance in full, along with any accrued and unpaid fees and interest.\nOn May 2, 2013, we entered into an amendment of its senior secured credit facility whereby the facility was increased from $265.0 million to $270.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rates on the revolving credit facility and term loans were reduced as described further in Note 8 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. On July 5, 2011, we completed a private placement of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes for which the registered exchange offering was completed on September 22, 2011. On April 27, 2012, we completed a private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes for which the registered exchange offering was completed on November 26, 2012. For further information refer to Note 8 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nThe senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants and financial ratio requirements, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2015, including a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as of December 31, 2015 of 3.3 versus a covenant of 6.5 times for each quarterly period. We are permitted to make quarterly dividend payments and other payments based on leverage ratios for NCM LLC and our subsidiary so long as no default or event of default has occurred and continues to occur. The quarterly dividend payments and other distributions are made if the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 6.5 times.\nThere are no borrower distribution restrictions as long as our consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is below 6.5 times and we are in compliance with our debt covenants. If there are limitations on the restricted payments, we may not declare or pay any dividends, or make any payments on our account, or set aside assets for the retirement or other acquisition of capital stock of the borrower or any subsidiary, or make any other distribution for our obligations. When these restrictions are effective, we may still pay the services fee and reimbursable costs pursuant to terms of the management agreement. We can also make payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the amount, and at the time necessary to satisfy the contractual obligations with respect to the actual cash tax benefits payable to our founding members.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, which management considers critical accounting policies. The judgments, assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience, knowledge of the accounts and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nNature of Estimates Required. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables, which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet. Estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience, consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor-specific factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Account receivable balances are charged against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance. A provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as, other pertinent factors. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods.\nSensitivity Analysis. As of December 31, 2015, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.6 million, or 3.6% of the gross accounts receivable balance. A 10% difference in the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2015 would have affected net income by approximately $0.6 million.\nShare-based compensation\nNature of Estimates Required. NCM, Inc.'s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Equity Incentive Plan\u201d) is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, and the determination of fair value of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments. Under the guidance, the fair value of each employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. Although NCM, Inc. has not granted stock options since 2012, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. The determination of fair value of stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nThe fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of NCM, Inc.'s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense equal to the fair value of each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. Certain of the restricted stock awards include performance vesting conditions, which permit vesting to the extent that NCM, Inc. achieves specified non-GAAP targets at the end of the measurement period. Compensation expense is based on management's projections and the probability of achievement of those expectations, which requires considerable judgment. We record a cumulative adjustment to share-based compensation expense in periods that we change our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. Additionally, we ultimately adjust the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used. In determining the value of stock options, we estimate an expected dividend yield based upon our expectation of the dividend that will be paid out on the underlying NCM, Inc. shares during the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is based on NCM, Inc.'s historical stock prices using a mathematical formula to measure the standard deviation of the change in the natural logarithm of our underlying stock price over a period of time commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the zero coupon rate on U.S. Treasury instruments with a term commensurate with the award's expected term.\nFor restricted stock with vesting contingent on the achievement of NCM, Inc.'s performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense is estimated based on the expected achievement of the performance condition. This requires us to make estimates of the likelihood of the achievement of NCM, Inc.'s performance conditions, which is highly judgmental. We base our judgments as to the expected achievement of NCM, Inc.'s performance conditions based on the financial projections of NCM, Inc. that are used by management for business purposes, which represent our best estimate of expected NCM, Inc. performance. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock-based awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of stock-based awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or decrease any remaining, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that NCM, Inc. grants additional stock-based awards, compensation expense will increase in relation to the fair value of the additional grants. Compensation expense may be significantly impacted in the future to the extent our estimates differ from actual results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our business operations, refer to the information provided under Note 1 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of the related-party transactions, refer to the information provided under Note 7 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur operating lease obligations, which primarily include office leases, are not reflected on our balance sheet. Refer to -Contractual and Other Obligations\u201d for further detail. We do not believe these arrangements are material to our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n1 fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 fiscal\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 fiscal\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 600.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 936.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash interest on borrowings (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network affiliate agreements (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 442.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 646.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,275.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We have a $135.0 million variable rate revolving credit facility of which $66.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nOverview\nNCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre video advertising network in North America, through which it distributes national and local advertising that the Company has sold on theatre screens and video screens in theatre lobbies. NCM LLC also sells theatre lobby promotions and online and mobile advertising that are displayed on its and other publisher websites and mobile sites and apps. Our revenue is principally derived from advertising distributed to NCM LLC's founding member theatres in accordance with long-term ESAs (over 21 years remaining as of December 31, 2015) and to network affiliates in accordance with multi-year agreements, which expire at various dates through July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 19.0 years as of December 31, 2015. The ESAs with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theatres to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our advertising FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is generated by theatres connected to our DCN (the remaining 601 screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings twice per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local/regional advertising rate per screen per week, local/regional and total advertising revenue per attendee, as well as, our free cash flow, dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA) and cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn December 26, 2013, we sold our Fathom Events business to a newly formed limited liability company (AC JV, LLC) owned 32% by each of the founding members and 4% by us. The Fathom Events business focused on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to theatre operators to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule. In consideration for the sale, we received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from our founding members (one-third from each founding member). Refer to Note 2 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, the Company announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. This payment was $2 million lower than the reverse termination fee contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data). Refer to Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d for a discussion of the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA and reconciliation to net income.\n\n \n (1) Merger termination fee and related merger costs primarily include the merger termination payment and legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated merger with Screenvision. \n (2) Represents the total attendance within our advertising network. \n (3) Excludes screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theatres for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. \nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to the completion of NCM, Inc.'s IPO, NCM LLC was wholly-owned by its founding members. In connection with the offering, NCM, Inc. purchased newly issued common membership units from NCM LLC and common membership units from our founding members, and became a member of and the sole manager of NCM LLC. We entered into several agreements to effect the reorganization and the financing transaction and certain amendments were made to the existing ESAs to govern the relationships among NCM LLC and our founding members after the completion of these transactions.\nThe results of operations data discussed herein were derived from the audited financial statements and accounting records of NCM LLC and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto.\nWe have a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25. Fiscal year 2014 contained 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2013 and 2015 contained 52 weeks. Our 2016 fiscal year will contain 52 weeks. Throughout this document, we refer to our fiscal years as set forth below:\n\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $52.5 million, or 13.3%, from $394.0 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $446.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions):\n\nThe following table shows data on revenue per attendee for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015:\n\n \n (1) Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC's advertising network. \n (2) Excludes screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theatres for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $50.7 million, or 19.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from NCM LLC's founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theatre attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $10.2 million, or 10.5%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from NCM LLC's founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 14.4% decrease in beverage revenue CPMs and a decrease of 0.4% in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The 2015 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2013 to 2014, which decreased 14.4%. Founding member beverage revenue also decreased by $2.7 million due to one of NCM LLC's founding members reducing the length of the beverage advertising unit from 60 seconds to 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015. We have the right to sell the 30 second unit to other clients.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses increased $71.2 million, or 30.3%, from $234.8 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $306.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table shows the changes in operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 (in millions):\n\nAdvertising operating costs. Advertising operating costs increased $4.4 million, or 16.7%, from $26.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $3.6 million increase in affiliate advertising payments which was driven by higher national and local advertising revenue and a 3.5% increase in the number of average affiliate screens for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.5 million, or 2.7%, from $18.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower salaries due to department realignment, partially offset by higher bonus expense due to improved performance against targets compared to 2014.\nTheatre access fees-founding members. Theatre access fees increased $1.9 million, or 2.7%, from $70.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $2.0 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. These fees increased $1.3 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.7 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment. This increase of $2.0 million was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in attendance related fees due to a 0.4% decrease in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $14.7 million, or 25.5%, from $57.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to\nan increase of $8.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense, higher commission expense and higher bonus expense, all primarily related to better performance against targets and higher revenue compared to 2014. Selling and marketing costs also increased due to an increase of $2.1 million in bad debt expense due to a smaller reserve in 2014 compared to 2015 and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash barter expense.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $2.1 million, or 10.9%, from $19.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014.\nAdministrative fee - managing member. Administrative fee-managing member increased $7.0 million, or 68.6%, from $10.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to personnel-related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014. Amounts recorded are based on the terms of the management services agreement which states NCM LLC pays NCM, Inc. service fees which are equal to the cost of NCM, Inc. employees and any reimbursable costs incurred by NCM, Inc.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from $32.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related to new affiliate agreements and NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. Merger-related costs were $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and $15.0 million in legal, accounting and advisory fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 14.8%, from $62.1 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 (in millions):\n\nThe decrease in non-operating expense was due primarily to an $8.4 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015 and a decrease of $0.6 million in other non-operating expense.\nNet income. Net income decreased $8.8 million from $96.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in operating income of $18.7 million, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in non-operating expenses of $9.2 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $0.7 million.\nYears Ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended January 1, 2015 decreased $68.8 million, or 14.9%, to $394.0 million, compared to $462.8 million for the 2013 period. The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions).\n\nThe following table shows data on revenue per attendee for the years ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 (in millions):\n\n (1) Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC's advertising network. \n (2) Excludes screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theatres for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $36.2 million, or 12.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from our founding members) was driven by a 16.4% decrease in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) due primarily to a soft television scatter marketplace, the increase in competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our client mix to new client industries that traditionally buy their television and other advertising at lower CPMs. National advertising revenue also decreased due to a decline in revenue by our content partners and scatter spending by our previous cell phone PSA client, which decreased $5.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively, compared to 2013. The decline in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue) was partially offset by an increase in utilized impressions of 4.0% in 2014 compared to 2013. Our national inventory utilization rose from 109.3% for the year ended December 26, 2013 to 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015, primarily due to an overall expansion of our client base and the success of the October 1, 2014 through", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nOverview\nNCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre video advertising network in North America, through which it distributes national and local advertising that the Company has sold on theatre screens and video screens in theatre lobbies. NCM LLC also sells theatre lobby promotions and online and mobile advertising that are displayed on its and other publisher websites and mobile sites and apps. Our revenue is principally derived from advertising distributed to NCM LLC's founding member theatres in accordance with long-term ESAs (over 21 years remaining as of December 31, 2015) and to network affiliates in accordance with multi-year agreements, which expire at various dates through July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 19.0 years as of December 31, 2015. The ESAs with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theatres to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our advertising FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is generated by theatres connected to our DCN (the remaining 601 screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings twice per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local/regional advertising rate per screen per week, local/regional and total advertising revenue per attendee, as well as, our free cash flow, dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA) and cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn December 26, 2013, we sold our Fathom Events business to a newly formed limited liability company (AC JV, LLC) owned 32% by each of the founding members and 4% by us. The Fathom Events business focused on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to theatre operators to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule. In consideration for the sale, we received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from our founding members (one-third from each founding member). Refer to Note 2 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, the Company announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. This payment was $2 million lower than the reverse termination fee contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million incurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). The Company and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data).

In connection with the offering, NCM, Inc. purchased newly issued common membership units from NCM LLC and common membership units from our founding members, and became a member of and the sole manager of NCM LLC. We entered into several agreements to effect the reorganization and the financing transaction and certain amendments were made to the existing ESAs to govern the relationships among NCM LLC and our founding members after the completion of these transactions.\nThe results of operations data discussed herein were derived from the audited financial statements and accounting records of NCM LLC and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto.\nWe have a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25. Fiscal year 2014 contained 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2013 and 2015 contained 52 weeks. Our 2016 fiscal year will contain 52 weeks.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $50.7 million, or 19.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from NCM LLC's founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theatre attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $10.2 million, or 10.5%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from NCM LLC's founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 14.4% decrease in beverage revenue CPMs and a decrease of 0.4% in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The 2015 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2013 to 2014, which decreased 14.4%. Founding member beverage revenue also decreased by $2.7 million due to one of NCM LLC's founding members reducing the length of the beverage advertising unit from 60 seconds to 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015.

Advertising operating costs increased $4.4 million, or 16.7%, from $26.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $3.6 million increase in affiliate advertising payments which was driven by higher national and local advertising revenue and a 3.5% increase in the number of average affiliate screens for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.5 million, or 2.7%, from $18.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower salaries due to department realignment, partially offset by higher bonus expense due to improved performance against targets compared to 2014.\nTheatre access fees-founding members. Theatre access fees increased $1.9 million, or 2.7%, from $70.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $2.0 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. These fees increased $1.3 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.7 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment. This increase of $2.0 million was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in attendance related fees due to a 0.4% decrease in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $14.7 million, or 25.5%, from $57.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to\nan increase of $8.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense, higher commission expense and higher bonus expense, all primarily related to better performance against targets and higher revenue compared to 2014. Selling and marketing costs also increased due to an increase of $2.1 million in bad debt expense due to a smaller reserve in 2014 compared to 2015 and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash barter expense.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $2.1 million, or 10.9%, from $19.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014.\nAdministrative fee - managing member. Administrative fee-managing member increased $7.0 million, or 68.6%, from $10.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to personnel-related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014. Amounts recorded are based on the terms of the management services agreement which states NCM LLC pays NCM, Inc. service fees which are equal to the cost of NCM, Inc. employees and any reimbursable costs incurred by NCM, Inc.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from $32.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related to new affiliate agreements and NCM LLC founding member common unit adjustments.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. Merger-related costs were $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and $15.0 million in legal, accounting and advisory fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses decreased $9.2 million, or 14.8%, from $62.1 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net income decreased $8.8 million from $96.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $87.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in operating income of $18.7 million, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in non-operating expenses of $9.2 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $0.7 million.\nYears Ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended January 1, 2015 decreased $68.8 million, or 14.9%, to $394.0 million, compared to $462.8 million for the 2013 period.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $36.2 million, or 12.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from our founding members) was driven by a 16.4% decrease in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) due primarily to a soft television scatter marketplace, the increase in competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our client mix to new client industries that traditionally buy their television and other advertising at lower CPMs. National advertising revenue also decreased due to a decline in revenue by our content partners and scatter spending by our previous cell phone PSA client, which decreased $5.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively, compared to 2013. The decline in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue) was partially offset by an increase in utilized impressions of 4.0% in 2014 compared to 2013. Our national inventory utilization rose from 109.3% for the year ended December 26, 2013 to 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015, primarily due to an overall expansion of our client base and the success of the October 1, 2014 through"}
