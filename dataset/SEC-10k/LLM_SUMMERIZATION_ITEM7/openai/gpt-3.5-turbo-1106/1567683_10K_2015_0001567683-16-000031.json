As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest. The guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period (January 1, 2013), or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period). The financial statements reflect the transfers as if they had taken place on May 13, 2013, for Kansas South, March 28, 2013, for TA High Desert and April 1, 2014, for the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the majority of the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which represents the date these entities were acquired by NRG. The Company reduces net income attributable to its Class A and Class C common stockholders by the pre-acquisition net income for the Drop Down Assets, as it is not available to the stockholders.\nIn addition, for all periods prior to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's accounting predecessor, NRG Yield, the financial statements of which were prepared on a ''carve-out'' basis from NRG and are intended to represent the financial results of the contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. that were acquired by NRG Yield LLC on July 22, 2013. For all periods subsequent to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's consolidated financial results.\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which present the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe Company is a dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company believes it is well positioned to be a premier company for investors seeking stable and growing dividend income from a diversified portfolio of lower-risk high-quality assets.\nThe Company owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. The Company's contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,435 net MW. Each of these assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 17 years as of December 31, 2015, based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,315 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 124 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nGovernment Incentives\nGovernment incentives can enhance the economics of the Company's generating assets or investments by providing, for example, loan guarantees, cash grants, favorable tax treatment, favorable depreciation rules, or other incentives. Certain changes in law enhance federal incentives for renewable generation - including through the extensions of the wind power PTC and the solar power ITC - and could incentivize the development of additional renewable energy projects that would fit within the Company's asset portfolio. In addition, direct cash incentives may encourage additional renewable energy development by entities that cannot presently benefit from tax credits.\nSignificant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired 75% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities totaling 814 net MW, from NRG for total cash consideration of $209 million.

The Company's results were impacted by lower than normal wind resource availability in 2015. While the Company's wind facilities were available, adverse weather had a negative impact on wind resources. The Company cannot predict wind and solar resource availability and their related impacts on future results.\nCapital Market Conditions\nThe Company and its peer group have recently experienced difficult conditions in the capital markets. The Company's growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional conventional and renewable facilities from NRG and unaffiliated third parties. A prolonged disruption in the equity capital market conditions could make it difficult for the Company to successfully acquire attractive projects from NRG or third parties and may also limit the Company's ability to obtain debt or equity financing to complete such acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise adequate proceeds when needed to fund such acquisitions, the ability to grow its project portfolio may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to implement its growth strategy. A full description of the risks applicable to the Company's business is presented in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe following table provides

Accordingly, the results presented herein reflect the Company's ownership of the EME Assets for the full year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the nine months from April 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nThe Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.

pretax income of $103 million. For the same period in 2013, the Company recorded income tax expense of $8 million on pretax income of $131 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from its interest in NRG Yield LLC and PTCs generated from certain wind generation facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from its interest in NRG Yield LLC.\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had income of $48 million and $42 million, respectively, attributable to NRG's interest in the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's principal liquidity requirements are to meet its financial commitments, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, to service debt and to pay dividends. Historically, the Company's predecessor operations were financed as part of NRG's integrated operations and largely relied on internally generated cash flows as well as corporate and/or project-level borrowings to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements. As a normal part of the Company's business, depending on market conditions, the Company will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance its indebtedness. Changes in the Company's operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nLiquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the Company's liquidity was approximately $292 million and $888 million, respectively, comprised of cash, restricted cash, and availability under the Company's revolving credit facility. The decrease primarily relates to increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of the November 2015 Drop Down Assets and the use of cash on hand to fund the acquisition of the January 2015 Drop Down Assets. The Company's various financing arrangements are described in Item 15 - Note 9, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On June 26, 2015, the Company amended the revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the availability from $450 million to $495 million. As of December 31, 2015, $306 million of borrowings and $56 million of letters of credit were outstanding.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position, cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the Company's financial commitments; debt service obligations; growth, operating and maintenance capital expenditures; and to fund dividends to holders of the Company's Class A common stock and Class C common stock. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit rating agencies rate a firm's public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firm's credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Company's ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm's industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm's credit risk.\nThe following table summarizes the credit ratings for the Company and its Senior Notes as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NRG Yield, Inc.\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.375% Senior Notes, due 2024\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under new and existing financing arrangements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. As described in Item 15 - Note 9, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and above in Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015, and Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2014, the Company's financing arrangements consist of the revolving credit facility, the 2019 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, the Senior Notes and project-level financings for its various assets.\nRecapitalization\nAs described above in Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015, effective May 14, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. amended its certificate of incorporation to create two new classes of capital stock, Class C common stock and Class D common stock, and distributed shares of the Class C common stock and Class D common stock to holders of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, through a stock split.\nThe par value per share of the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock remains unchanged at $0.01 per share after the effect of the stock split. Accordingly, the stock split was accounted for as a stock dividend. The Company recorded a transfer between retained earnings and common stock equal to the par value of each share of Class C common stock and Class D common stock that was issued. The Company also gave retroactive effect to prior period share and per share amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect of the stock dividend, such that all periods are comparable.\nIn connection with the amendment described above, the ROFO Agreement was amended to make additional assets available to the Company should NRG choose to sell them, including (i) two natural gas facilities totaling 795 MW of net capacity that are expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020, (ii) an equity interest in a wind portfolio that includes wind facilities totaling approximately 934 MW of net capacity, the majority of which was sold to the Company on November 3, 2015, and (iii) up to $250 million of equity interests in one or more residential or distributed solar generation portfolios developed by affiliates of NRG.\nOn June 29, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. issued 28,198,000 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $599 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $21 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 28,198,000 additional Class C units of NRG Yield LLC and, as a result, it currently owns 53.3% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC, with NRG retaining 46.7% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC. Additionally, on June 29, 2015, the Company completed an offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Notes due 2020, which proceeds were subsequently lent to NRG Yield LLC.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, are categorized as: (i) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 - Note 9, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) acquisitions and investments; and (iv) cash dividends to investors.\nDebt Service Obligations\nPrincipal payments on debt as of December 31, 2015, are due in the following periods:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>There-after\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NRG Yield, Inc.

replace or refurbish assets during routine maintenance, and growth capital expenditures or construction of new assets and completing the construction of assets where construction is in process. The Company develops annual capital spending plans based on projected requirements for maintenance and growth capital. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company used approximately $29 million, $33 million, and $353 million, respectively, to fund capital expenditures, including maintenance capital expenditures of $20 million, $8 million and $8 million, respectively. Growth capital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 primarily related to the construction of the Company's solar generating assets, Marsh Landing and El Segundo.\nIn January 2015, El Segundo experienced a steam turbine water intrusion resulting in a forced outage on Units 5 and 6. The units returned to service in April 2015. The Company completed a root cause analysis and has implemented steps to prevent a recurrence of the event. The Company reviewed the financial impact of repair costs and lost capacity revenue and collected approximately $4 million of insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company intends to acquire generation assets developed and constructed by NRG in the future, as well as generation and thermal infrastructure assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides a competitive advantage, and to utilize such acquisitions as a means to grow its CAFD. See Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015, above for a description of the acquisitions and investments that have taken place during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCash Dividends to Investors\nThe Company intends to use the amount of cash that it receives from its distributions from NRG Yield LLC to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of its Class A common stock and Class C common stock. NRG Yield LLC intends to distribute to its unit holders in the form of a quarterly distribution all of the CAFD that is generated each quarter, less reserves for the prudent conduct of the business, including among others, maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of the assets. CAFD is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, less cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, maintenance capital expenditures, pro-rata EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, income taxes paid, principal amortization of indebtedness and changes in other assets. Dividends on the Class A common stock and Class C common stock are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company expects that, based on current circumstances, comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the foreseeable future.\nThe following table lists the dividends paid on the Company's Class A common stock and Class C common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has a cumulative federal NOL carry forward balance of $519 million for financial statement purposes, which will begin expiring in 2033, and does not anticipate any federal income tax payments for 2016. As a result of the Company's tax position, and based on current forecasts, the Company does not anticipate significant income tax payments for state and local jurisdictions in 2016. Based on the Company's current and expected NOL balances generated primarily by accelerated tax depreciation of its property, plant and equipment, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income tax for a period of approximately nine years.\nThe Company has no uncertain tax benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nObligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts\nThe Company may enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties.\nRetained or Contingent Interests\nThe Company does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.\nObligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\nVariable interest in equity investments - As of December 31, 2015, the Company has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method. NRG DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, NRG RPV Holdco 1 LLC and GenConn are variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary.\nThe Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $842 million as of December 31, 2015. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to the Company. See also Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe Company has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements.\nThe tables below disclose the activities of non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820.

As discussed below in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk -Commodity Price Risk, NRG, on behalf of the Company, measures the sensitivity of the portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the net open position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policies include income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets, and acquisition accounting.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policy\n</td> <td>Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n</td> <td>Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ability to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long Lived Assets\n</td> <td>Recoverability of investments through future operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated useful lives of assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Operational limitations and environmental obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of future cash flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about triggering events\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition Accounting\n</td> <td>Identification of intangible assets acquired\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Inputs for fair value of assets and liabilities acquired\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Application of various methodologies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon earnings in federal and various state and local jurisdictions.\nThe Company's operating entities, as former subsidiaries of NRG, continue to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. The project-level entities, as former subsidiaries of NRG, are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. NRG is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2012. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2009.\nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adverse business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to us. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. The Company uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.\nThe Company is also required to evaluate its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value is considered an \"other than a temporary\" decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that the Company makes with respect to its equity method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, the Company would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under ASC 323.\nAcquisition Accounting\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations, when accounting for the acquisition of a business, with identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The Company completes the accounting for an acquisition when the evaluations are completed to the extent that additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the date of the acquisition as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Consideration is measured based on fair value of the assets transferred to the seller.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, predominantly with respect to property, plant and equipment, power purchase agreements, asset retirement obligations and other contractual arrangements. Evaluations include numerous inputs including forecasted cash flows that incorporate the specific attributes of each asset including age, useful life, equipment condition and technology, as well as current replacement costs for similar assets. Other key inputs that require judgment include discount rates, comparable market transactions, estimated useful lives and probability of future transactions. The Company evaluates all available information, as well as all appropriate methodologies when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In addition, once the appropriate fair values are determined, the Company must determine the remaining useful life for property, plant and equipment and the amortization period and method of amortization for each finite-lived intangible asset.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.", "summary": "The MD&A report provides an analysis of the Company's historical financial condition and results of operations, including the effect of various acquisitions.

Condition and the Results of Operations\nThe following discussion analyzes the Company's historical financial condition and results of operations, which were recast to include the effect of the June 2014 Drop Down Assets, the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which were acquired on June 30, 2014, January 2, 2015, and November 3, 2015, respectively. As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest. The guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period (January 1, 2013), or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period). The financial statements reflect the transfers as if they had taken place on May 13, 2013, for Kansas South, March 28, 2013, for TA High Desert and April 1, 2014, for the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the majority of the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which represents the date these entities were acquired by NRG. The Company reduces net income attributable to its Class A and Class C common stockholders by the pre-acquisition net income for the Drop Down Assets, as it is not available to the stockholders.\nIn addition, for all periods prior to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's accounting predecessor, NRG Yield, the financial statements of which were prepared on a ''carve-out'' basis from NRG and are intended to represent the financial results of the contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. that were acquired by NRG Yield LLC on July 22, 2013. For all periods subsequent to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's consolidated financial results.\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which present the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\n \u2022 Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition; \n \u2022 Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; \n \u2022 Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. \nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe Company is a dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company believes it is well positioned to be a premier company for investors seeking stable and growing dividend income from a diversified portfolio of lower-risk high-quality assets.\nThe Company owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. The Company's contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,435 net MW. Each of these assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 17 years as of December 31, 2015, based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,315 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 124 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nGovernment Incentives\nGovernment incentives can enhance the economics of the Company's generating assets or investments by providing, for example, loan guarantees, cash grants, favorable tax treatment, favorable depreciation rules, or other incentives. Certain changes in law enhance federal incentives for renewable generation - including through the extensions of the wind power PTC and the solar power ITC - and could incentivize the development of additional renewable energy projects that would fit within the Company's asset portfolio. In addition, direct cash incentives may encourage additional renewable energy development by entities that cannot presently benefit from tax credits.\nSignificant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired 75% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities totaling 814 net MW, from NRG for total cash consideration of $209 million. In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of $2 million, reducing total cash consideration to $207 million. The Company is responsible for its pro-rata share of non-recourse project debt of $193 million and noncontrolling interest associated with a tax equity structure of $159 million (as of the acquisition date). \n \u2022 On June 30, 2015, the Company sold an economic interest in the Alta X and Alta XI wind facilities through a tax equity financing arrangement and received $119 million in net proceeds. These proceeds, as well as proceeds obtained from the Company's June 2015 equity and debt offerings discussed below, were utilized to repay all of the outstanding project indebtedness associated with the Alta X and Alta XI wind facilities. \n \u2022 On June 29, 2015, the Company issued 28,198,000 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, of $599 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 28,198,000 additional Class C units of NRG Yield LLC and, as a result, it currently owns 53.3% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC, with NRG retaining 46.7% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC. Additionally, on June 29, 2015, the Company completed an offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Notes due 2020, which proceeds were subsequently lent to NRG Yield LLC. \n \u2022 On June 29, 2015, the Company acquired 25% of the membership interest in Desert Sunlight Investment Holdings, LLC, which owns two solar photovoltaic facilities totaling 550 MW, located in Desert Center, California, from EFS Desert Sun, LLC, a subsidiary of GE Energy Financial Services, for a purchase price of $285 million, utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the Class C common stock issuance. The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse project level debt was $272 million as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Effective May 14, 2015, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create two new classes of capital stock, Class C common stock and Class D common stock, and distributed shares of the Class C common stock and Class D common stock to holders of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, through a stock split, which is referred to as the Recapitalization. The Recapitalization enhances the Company's ability to focus on growth opportunities without the constraints of NRG's capital allocation to the Company, while maintaining the Company's relationship with NRG. The Recapitalization preserves NRG's management and operational expertise, \nasset development and acquisition track record, financing experience and provides flexibility for the Company to raise capital to fund its growth.\nThe Class C common stock and Class D common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, as to all matters, except that each share of Class C common stock and Class D common stock is entitled to 1/100th of a vote on all stockholder matters.\nIn connection with the Recapitalization, the ROFO Agreement was amended to make additional assets available to the Company should NRG choose to sell them, including (i) two natural gas facilities totaling 795 MW of net capacity that are expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020, (ii) an equity interest in a wind portfolio that includes wind facilities totaling approximately 934 MW of net capacity, the majority of which was sold to the Company on November 3, 2015, and (iii) up to $250 million of equity interests in one or more residential or distributed solar generation portfolios developed by affiliates of NRG.\n \u2022 On May 8, 2015, the Company and NRG entered into a partnership by forming NRG DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 1, the purpose of which is to own or purchase solar power generation projects and other ancillary related assets from NRG Renew DG Holdings LLC, via intermediate funds, including: (i) a tax equity-financed portfolio of 10 recently completed community solar projects representing approximately 8 MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of 20 years; and (ii) a tax equity-financed portfolio of approximately 12 commercial photovoltaic systems representing approximately 37 MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of 19 years. Under this partnership, the Company committed to fund up to $100 million of capital. On February 29, 2016, the Company and NRG entered into an additional partnership by forming NRG DGPV Holdco 2 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 2, to own or purchase solar power generation projects and other ancillary related assets from NRG Renew LLC or its subsidiaries, via intermediate funds. Under this partnership, the Company committed to fund up to $50 million of capital. \n \u2022 On May 7, 2015, the Company acquired a 90.1% interest in Spring Canyon II, a 32 MW wind facility, and Spring Canyon III, a 28 MW wind facility, each located in Logan County, Colorado, from Invenergy Wind Global LLC. The purchase price was funded with cash on hand. Power generated by Spring Canyon II and Spring Canyon III is sold to Platte River Power Authority under long-term PPAs with approximately 24 years of remaining contract life. \n \u2022 On April 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the University of Bridgeport Fuel Cell project in Bridgeport, Connecticut from FuelCell Energy, Inc. The project added an additional 1.4 MW of thermal capacity with a 12-year contract, with the option for a 7-year extension. \n \u2022 On April 9, 2015, the Company and NRG entered into a partnership by forming RPV Holdco, to invest in and hold operating portfolios of residential solar assets developed by NRG Home Solar, a subsidiary of NRG, including: (i) an existing, unlevered portfolio of over 2,200 leases across nine states representing approximately 17 MW with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 17 years, in which the Company invested $26 million in April 2015; and (ii) a tax equity financed portfolio of approximately 5,700 leases representing approximately 40 MW, with an average lease term for the existing and new leases of approximately 17 to 20 years, in which the Company invested $36 million of its $150 million commitment through December 31, 2015. On February 29, 2016, the Company and NRG amended the RPV Holdco partnership to reduce the aggregate commitment of $150 million to $100 million in connection with the formation of DGPV Holdco 2 discussed above. \n \u2022 On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the following projects from NRG: (i) Laredo Ridge, an 80 MW wind facility located in Petersburg, Nebraska, (ii) Tapestry, which includes Buffalo Bear, a 19 MW wind facility in Buffalo, Oklahoma; Taloga, a 130 MW wind facility in Putnam, Oklahoma; and Pinnacle, a 55 MW wind facility in Keyser, West Virginia, and (iii) Walnut Creek, a 485 MW natural gas facility located in City of Industry, California, for total cash consideration of $489 million, including $9 million for working capital, plus assumed project-level debt of $737 million. The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under its revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 In January 2015, El Segundo experienced a steam turbine water intrusion resulting in a forced outage on Units 5 and 6. The units returned to service in April 2015. The Company completed a root cause analysis and has implemented steps to prevent a recurrence of the event. The Company reviewed the financial impact of repair costs and lost capacity revenue and collected approximately $4 million of insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2015. \nSignificant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n \u2022 On August 12, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Alta Wind Asset Management Holdings, LLC, Alta Wind Company, LLC, Alta Wind X Holding Company, LLC and Alta Wind XI Holding Company, LLC, which \ncollectively own seven wind facilities that total 947 MW located in Tehachapi, California, and a portfolio of associated land leases, or the Alta Wind Portfolio. The purchase price for the Alta Wind Portfolio was $923 million, which included a base purchase price of $870 million, and a payment for working capital of $53 million, plus the assumption of $1.6 billion of non-recourse project-level debt. In order to fund the purchase price, the Company completed an equity offering of 12,075,000 shares of its Class A common stock on July 29, 2014, which resulted in net proceeds of $630 million, after underwriting discounts and expenses, that were utilized to acquire additional Class A units in NRG Yield LLC. In addition, on August 5, 2014, NRG Yield Operating LLC, or Yield Operating, the holder of the project assets that belong to Yield LLC, issued $500 million of Senior Notes, as described in Item 15 - Note 9, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 On June 30, 2014, the Company acquired from NRG: (i) El Segundo, a 550 MW fast-start, gas-fired facility located in Los Angeles County, California; (ii) TA High Desert, a 20 MW solar facility located in Los Angeles County, California; and (iii) Kansas South, a 20 MW solar facility located in Kings County, California. The assets were acquired pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. The Company paid NRG total cash consideration of $357 million, which represents a base purchase price of $349 million and a payment for working capital of $8 million. In addition, the acquisition included the assumption of $612 million in project-level debt. \n \u2022 During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued $345 million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible notes as described in Item 15 - Note 9, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2013\n \u2022 On December 31, 2013, NRG Energy Center Omaha Holdings, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Yield LLC, acquired Energy Systems Company, or Energy Systems, an operator of steam and chilled thermal facilities that provides heating and cooling services to nonresidential customers in Omaha, Nebraska.

Environmental Matters and Regulatory Matters\nDetails of environmental matters and regulatory matters are presented in Item 1 - Business, Regulatory Matters and Item 1A - Risk Factors. Details of some of this information relate to costs that may impact the Company's financial results.\nTrends Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance\nWind and Solar Resource Availability\nWind and solar resource availability can affect the Company's results. The Company's results were impacted by lower than normal wind resource availability in 2015. While the Company's wind facilities were available, adverse weather had a negative impact on wind resources. The Company cannot predict wind and solar resource availability and their related impacts on future results.\nCapital Market Conditions\nThe Company and its peer group have recently experienced difficult conditions in the capital markets. The Company's growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional conventional and renewable facilities from NRG and unaffiliated third parties. A prolonged disruption in the equity capital market conditions could make it difficult for the Company to successfully acquire attractive projects from NRG or third parties and may also limit the Company's ability to obtain debt or equity financing to complete such acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise adequate proceeds when needed to fund such acquisitions, the ability to grow its project portfolio may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to implement its growth strategy. A full description of the risks applicable to the Company's business is presented in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe following table provides selected financial information: \n\n \n(a) Volumes sold do not include the MWh generated by the Company's equity method investments.\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014\nAs described in Item 15 - Note 3, Business Acquisitions, the Company completed the following acquisitions from NRG during the year ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired 75% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities totaling 814 net MW, from NRG for total cash consideration of $209 million. In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of $2 million, reducing total cash consideration to $207 million. \n \u2022 On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the Laredo Ridge, Tapestry, and Walnut Creek projects, or the January 2015 Drop Down Assets, for total cash consideration of $489 million, plus assumed project-level debt of $737 million.  The January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the November 2015 Drop Down Assets (other than Elbow Creek) were originally acquired by NRG from EME on April 1, 2014, and are collectively referred to as \"EME Assets\" throughout this discussion. The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements for the periods ending December 31, 2015, and 2014, to reflect the acquisitions as if they had taken place from the date the entities were under common control, which was April 1, 2014 for the EME Assets. Accordingly, the results presented herein reflect the Company's ownership of the EME Assets for the full year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the nine months from April 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nThe Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities or contract amortization. The following tables present the composition of economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nEconomic gross margin increased by $170 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, driven by:\n\nContract amortization\nContract amortization increased by $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to the amortization of the PPAs acquired in the acquisition of the Alta Wind Portfolio in August 2014.\nMark-to-market for economic hedging activities\nMark-to-market results for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 represent the unrealized losses and gains, respectively, on forward contracts with an NRG subsidiary hedging the sale of power from the Elbow Creek wind facility extending through the end of 2015, as further described in Item 15 - Note 7, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperations and Maintenance Expense\n\nOperations and maintenance expense increased by $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, driven by:\n\nOther Costs of Operations\nOther costs of operations increased by $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to an increase in property taxes resulting from the acquisitions of the Alta Wind Portfolio in August 2014 and the EME Assets in April 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $63 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to the acquisitions of the Alta Wind Portfolio in August 2014 and the EME Assets in April 2014.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to the acquisition of Desert Sunlight in June 2015 as well as the Elkhorn Ridge and San Juan Mesa projects, acquired as part of the EME Assets.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $47 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 due to:\n\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $12 million on pretax income of $67 million. For the same period in 2014, the Company recorded income tax expense of $4 million on pretax income of $103 million. For the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 the overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from its interest in NRG Yield LLC and PTCs derived from certain wind generation facilities.\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had income of $56 million attributable to NRG's interest in the Company and a loss of $14 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had income of $48 million attributable to NRG's interest in the Company.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2014 compared to 2013\nThe following table provides selected financial information:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\nThe following discussion analyzes the Company's historical financial condition and results of operations, which were recast to include the effect of the June 2014 Drop Down Assets, the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which were acquired on June 30, 2014, January 2, 2015, and November 3, 2015, respectively. As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest. The guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period (January 1, 2013), or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period). The financial statements reflect the transfers as if they had taken place on May 13, 2013, for Kansas South, March 28, 2013, for TA High Desert and April 1, 2014, for the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the majority of the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which represents the date these entities were acquired by NRG. The Company reduces net income attributable to its Class A and Class C common stockholders by the pre-acquisition net income for the Drop Down Assets, as it is not available to the stockholders.\nIn addition, for all periods prior to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's accounting predecessor, NRG Yield, the financial statements of which were prepared on a ''carve-out'' basis from NRG and are intended to represent the financial results of the contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. that were acquired by NRG Yield LLC on July 22, 2013. For all periods subsequent to the initial public offering, the discussion reflects the Company's consolidated financial results.\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which present the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\n \u2022 Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition; \n \u2022 Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; \n \u2022 Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. \nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe Company is a dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company believes it is well positioned to be a premier company for investors seeking stable and growing dividend income from a diversified portfolio of lower-risk high-quality assets.\nThe Company owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S. The Company's contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,435 net MW. Each of these assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 17 years as of December 31, 2015, based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,315 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 124 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nGovernment Incentives\nGovernment incentives can enhance the economics of the Company's generating assets or investments by providing, for example, loan guarantees, cash grants, favorable tax treatment, favorable depreciation rules, or other incentives. Certain changes in law enhance federal incentives for renewable generation - including through the extensions of the wind power PTC and the solar power ITC - and could incentivize the development of additional renewable energy projects that would fit within the Company's asset portfolio. In addition, direct cash incentives may encourage additional renewable energy development by entities that cannot presently benefit from tax credits.\nSignificant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired 75% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities totaling 814 net MW, from NRG for total cash consideration of $209 million. In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of $2 million, reducing total cash consideration to $207 million. The Company is responsible for its pro-rata share of non-recourse project debt of $193 million and noncontrolling interest associated with a tax equity structure of $159 million (as of the acquisition date). \n \u2022 On June 30, 2015, the Company sold an economic interest in the Alta X and Alta XI wind facilities through a tax equity financing arrangement and received $119 million in net proceeds. These proceeds, as well as proceeds obtained from the Company's June 2015 equity and debt offerings discussed below, were utilized to repay all of the outstanding project indebtedness associated with the Alta X and Alta XI wind facilities. \n \u2022 On June 29, 2015, the Company issued 28,198,000 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, of $599 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 28,198,000 additional Class C units of NRG Yield LLC and, as a result, it currently owns 53.3% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC, with NRG retaining 46.7% of the economic interests of NRG Yield LLC. Additionally, on June 29, 2015, the Company completed an offering of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Notes due 2020, which proceeds were subsequently lent to NRG Yield LLC. \n \u2022 On June 29, 2015, the Company acquired 25% of the membership interest in Desert Sunlight Investment Holdings, LLC, which owns two solar photovoltaic facilities totaling 550 MW, located in Desert Center, California, from EFS Desert Sun, LLC, a subsidiary of GE Energy Financial Services, for a purchase price of $285 million, utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the Class C common stock issuance. The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse project level debt was $272 million as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Effective May 14, 2015, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create two new classes of capital stock, Class C common stock and Class D common stock, and distributed shares of the Class C common stock and Class D common stock to holders of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, through a stock split, which is referred to as the Recapitalization. The Recapitalization enhances the Company's ability to focus on growth opportunities without the constraints of NRG's capital allocation to the Company, while maintaining the Company's relationship with NRG. The Recapitalization preserves NRG's management and operational expertise, \nasset development and acquisition track record, financing experience and provides flexibility for the Company to raise capital to fund its growth.\nThe Class C common stock and Class D common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, as to all matters, except that each share of Class C common stock and Class D common stock is entitled to 1/100th of a vote on all stockholder matters.\nIn connection with the Recapitalization, the ROFO Agreement was amended to make additional assets available to the Company should NRG choose to sell them, including (i) two natural gas facilities totaling 795 MW of net capacity that are expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020, (ii) an equity interest in a wind portfolio that includes wind facilities totaling approximately 934 MW of net capacity, the majority of which was sold to the Company on November 3, 2015, and (iii) up to $250 million of equity interests in one or more residential or distributed solar generation portfolios developed by affiliates of NRG.\n \u2022 On May 8, 2015, the Company and NRG entered into a partnership by forming NRG DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 1, the purpose of which is to own or purchase solar power generation projects and other ancillary related assets from NRG Renew DG Holdings LLC, via intermediate funds, including: (i) a tax equity-financed portfolio of 10 recently completed community solar projects representing approximately 8 MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of 20 years; and (ii) a tax equity-financed portfolio of approximately 12 commercial photovoltaic systems representing approximately 37 MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of 19 years. Under this partnership, the Company committed to fund up to $100 million of capital. On February 29, 2016, the Company and NRG entered into an additional partnership by forming NRG DGPV Holdco 2 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 2, to own or purchase solar power generation projects and other ancillary related assets from NRG Renew LLC or its subsidiaries, via intermediate funds. Under this partnership, the Company committed to fund up to $50 million of capital. \n \u2022 On May 7, 2015, the Company acquired a 90.1% interest in Spring Canyon II, a 32 MW wind facility, and Spring Canyon III, a 28 MW wind facility, each located in Logan County, Colorado, from Invenergy Wind Global LLC. The purchase price was funded with cash on hand. Power generated by Spring Canyon II and Spring Canyon III is sold to Platte River Power Authority under long-term PPAs with approximately 24 years of remaining contract life. \n \u2022 On April 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the University of Bridgeport Fuel Cell project in Bridgeport, Connecticut from FuelCell Energy, Inc. The project added an additional 1.4 MW of thermal capacity with a 12-year contract, with the option for a 7-year extension. \n \u2022 On April 9, 2015, the Company and NRG entered into a partnership by forming RPV Holdco, to invest in and hold operating portfolios of residential solar assets developed by NRG Home Solar, a subsidiary of NRG, including: (i) an existing, unlevered portfolio of over 2,200 leases across nine states representing approximately 17 MW with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 17 years, in which the Company invested $26 million in April 2015; and (ii) a tax equity financed portfolio of approximately 5,700 leases representing approximately 40 MW, with an average lease term for the existing and new leases of approximately 17 to 20 years, in which the Company invested $36 million of its $150 million commitment through December 31, 2015. On February 29, 2016, the Company and NRG amended the RPV Holdco partnership to reduce the aggregate commitment of $150 million to $100 million in connection with the formation of DGPV Holdco 2 discussed above. \n \u2022 On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the following projects from NRG: (i) Laredo Ridge, an 80 MW wind facility located in Petersburg, Nebraska, (ii) Tapestry, which includes Buffalo Bear, a 19 MW wind facility in Buffalo, Oklahoma; Taloga, a 130 MW wind facility in Putnam, Oklahoma; and Pinnacle, a 55 MW wind facility in Keyser, West Virginia, and (iii) Walnut Creek, a 485 MW natural gas facility located in City of Industry, California, for total cash consideration of $489 million, including $9 million for working capital, plus assumed project-level debt of $737 million. The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under its revolving credit facility. \n \u2022 In January 2015, El Segundo experienced a steam turbine water intrusion resulting in a forced outage on Units 5 and 6. The units returned to service in April 2015. The Company completed a root cause analysis and has implemented steps to prevent a recurrence of the event. The Company reviewed the financial impact of repair costs and lost capacity revenue and collected approximately $4 million of insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2015. \nSignificant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n \u2022 On August 12, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Alta Wind Asset Management Holdings, LLC, Alta Wind Company, LLC, Alta Wind X Holding Company, LLC and Alta Wind XI Holding Company, LLC, which \ncollectively own seven wind facilities that total 947 MW located in Tehachapi, California, and a portfolio of associated land leases, or the Alta Wind Portfolio. The purchase price for the Alta Wind Portfolio was $923 million, which included a base purchase price of $870 million, and a payment for working capital of $53 million, plus the assumption of $1.6 billion of non-recourse project-level debt. In order to fund the purchase price, the Company completed an equity offering of 12,075,000 shares of its Class A common stock on July 29, 2014, which resulted in net proceeds of $630 million, after underwriting discounts and expenses, that were utilized to acquire additional Class A units in NRG Yield LLC.

Acquisitions, the Company completed the following acquisitions from NRG during the year ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired 75% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities totaling 814 net MW, from NRG for total cash consideration of $209 million. In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of $2 million, reducing total cash consideration to $207 million. \n \u2022 On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the Laredo Ridge, Tapestry, and Walnut Creek projects, or the January 2015 Drop Down Assets, for total cash consideration of $489 million, plus assumed project-level debt of $737 million.  The January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the November 2015 Drop Down Assets (other than Elbow Creek) were originally acquired by NRG from EME on April 1, 2014, and are collectively referred to as \"EME Assets\" throughout this discussion. The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements for the periods ending December 31, 2015, and 2014, to reflect the acquisitions as if they had taken place from the date the entities were under common control, which was April 1, 2014 for the EME Assets. Accordingly, the results presented herein reflect the Company's ownership of the EME Assets for the full year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the nine months from April 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nThe Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities or contract amortization. The following tables present the composition of economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Conventional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thermal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and capacity revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of fuels\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and capacity revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of fuels\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic gross margin increased by $170 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, driven by:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions of the Alta Wind Portfolio in August 2014 and Spring Canyon in May 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of EME Assets (Wind)\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of EME Assets (Walnut Creek)\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to the forced outage at El Segundo in the first half of 2015\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thermal:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease due to milder weather conditions in 2015 compared to 2014\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContract amortization\nContract amortization increased by $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to the amortization of the PPAs acquired in the acquisition of the Alta Wind Portfolio in August 2014.\nMark-to-market for economic hedging activities\nMark-to-market results for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 represent the unrealized losses and gains, respectively, on forward contracts with an NRG subsidiary hedging the sale of power from the Elbow Creek wind facility extending through the end of 2015, as further described in Item 15 -

For the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 the overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from its interest in NRG Yield LLC and PTCs derived from certain wind generation facilities.\nIncome Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had income of $56 million attributable to NRG's interest in the Company and a loss of $14 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method.
