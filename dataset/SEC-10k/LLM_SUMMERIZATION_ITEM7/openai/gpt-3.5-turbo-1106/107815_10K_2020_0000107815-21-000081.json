MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and derive revenues from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nPrior to April 1, 2019, we provided electric service to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This customer was transferred to UMERC on April 1, 2019 after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. WEC Energy Group's 2021-2025 capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as its ESG Progress Plan, provides a roadmap to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow WEC Energy Group's and our investment in the future of energy.\nThroughout its strategic planning process, WEC Energy Group takes into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and commodity prices, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability. WEC Energy Group published the results of a priority sustainability issue assessment in 2020, identifying the issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders over the short and long terms. This risk and priority assessment has formed WEC Energy Group's direction as a company.\nCreating a Sustainable Future\nWEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with the construction of zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation and clean natural gas-fired generation at its electric utilities including us. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance supply with demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electric generation.\nIn 2019, WEC Energy Group met and surpassed its original goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. In July 2020, WEC Energy Group announced new goals to reduce CO2 emissions from its electric generation by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to be net carbon neutral by 2050. It also added a near-term goal in November 2020 to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% below 2005 levels by 2025.\nWEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. As part of the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,800 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by 2025.\nIn addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, WEC Energy Group expects to invest approximately $2 billion from 2021-2025 in low-cost renewable energy in Wisconsin. WEC Energy Group's plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation and zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following new investments made by either us or WPS based on specific customer needs:\n\u2022800 MW of utility-scale solar;\n\u2022600 MW of battery storage;\n\u2022100 MW of wind;\n\u2022100 MW of reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) natural gas-fueled generation; and\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>30\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022the planned purchase of 200 MW of capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center - a new, combined-cycle natural gas plant recently completed by Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.\nThese new investments discussed above are in addition to the renewable projects currently underway.\nWe have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct Badger Hollow Solar Park II that is expected to enter commercial operation in December 2022. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of this project.\nIn December 2018, we received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, we have energized 13 Solar Now projects and currently have another five under construction, together totaling more than 15 MW. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that we would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\nWEC Energy Group also has a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in its networks by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. WEC Energy Group was over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with the ESG Progress Plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to operating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies being recognized in 2020 by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, for superior reliability of its electric delivery network. This was the 10th consecutive year that We Energies has been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest. We Energies is the trade name under which we and Wisconsin Gas LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, operate.\nBelow are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed or currently underway.\n\u2022We are constructing approximately 46 miles of natural gas transmission main to increase the quantity and reliability of natural gas service in southeastern Wisconsin. This project, called the Lakeshore Lateral Project, is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\n\u2022We plan to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to meet anticipated peak demand. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company and will continue to do so under the ESG Progress Plan. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating the resources of all of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>31\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nA multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across all of the WEC Energy Group companies. It has moved all utilities, including us, to a common platform for all customer-facing self-service options. Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers.\nSafety\nAcross the organization, we monitor the integrity of our networks and conduct comprehensive incident response planning to enhance the safety of our operations.\nUnder our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective December 31, 2020, we changed our measure of segment profitability from operating income to net income attributed to common shareholder. As no items were reported in our other segment during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, a similar discussion that compares our results for these years can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations in Part II of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Earnings\nOur earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $365.6 million, compared to $362.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See below for additional information on the $3.5 million increase in earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the contribution of our utility segment to net income attributed to common shareholder. The discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>32\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nof operating performance.

The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n\u2022An $82.8 million net decrease in margins related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This decrease in margins includes a $62.8 million negative impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to return to customers and is offset in income taxes.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>34\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022A $23.9 million decrease in margins from other revenues, primarily related to lower revenues from third party use of our assets.\n\u2022A $12.4 million net decrease in margins related to lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather. We recognized a $27.6 million net reduction in margins related to lower retail sales volumes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes for our commercial and industrial customers decreased, primarily related to business interruptions and closings, while residential sales volumes increased. These changes in volumes were both driven, in large part, by a shelter-in-place order issued by the state of Wisconsin, which was in effect from March 25, 2020 through April 24, 2020, as well as the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This net decrease in margins was partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in margins driven by warmer summer weather. As measured by cooling degree days, 2020 was 29.0% warmer than 2019.\n\u2022A $6.8 million decrease in margins related to lower wholesale sales volumes, driven by lower sales to UMERC. UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation on March 31, 2019, at which time we stopped providing wholesale services to UMERC.\n\u2022A $4.8 million decrease in margins from our steam operations driven by lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather.\n\u2022A $4.4 million decrease in margins related to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tilden was our customer but became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019.\nThese decreases in margins were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $101.8 million increase in margins associated with the 2019 negative impact of the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW to maintain certain regulatory assets at their December 31, 2017 levels. These tax benefits were no longer in effect for 2020. This increase in margins was offset in income taxes. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022An $8.6 million year-over-year positive impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our margins are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are within a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance beyond the 2% variance is deferred for future recovery or refund to customers.\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $12.8 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was a $20.5 million increase related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This increase in margins includes a $5.3 million positive impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to collect from customers and is offset in income taxes.\nThis increase in margins was partially offset by a $10.5 million net reduction in margins related to lower sales volumes, driven primarily by warmer winter weather during 2020. As measured by heating degree days, 2020 was 10.9% warmer than 2019. Natural gas utility margins were not impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\nOther operating expenses at the utility segment decreased $114.0 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses were:\n\u2022A $67.2 million decrease in transmission expense related to the flow through of tax repairs during 2019, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes.\n\u2022A $65.2 million decrease in transmission expense associated with the May 2018 order from the PSCW related to our required treatment of the tax benefits associated with the Tax Legislation, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset by a corresponding decrease in margins.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>35\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022A $38.6 million decrease in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022A $32.8 million decrease in regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $21.7 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, driven by lower maintenance and storm restoration expense, as well as our focus on operating efficiency.\n\u2022A $21.6 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to the We Power leases, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $15.6 million decrease in benefit costs, primarily due to lower deferred compensation costs, stock-based compensation, and medical costs.\nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n\u2022An $83.0 million increase in transmission expense as approved in the PSCW's 2019 rate order, which was effective January 1, 2020. See the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above for more information.\n\u2022A $42.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan as well as an increase related to the We Power leases.\n\u2022A $15.3 million net increase in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by changes to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2019 Wisconsin rate order. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the Wisconsin rate orders. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operation and maintenance at our plants, driven by the retirement of PIPP in March 2019 and reduced operation of the OCPP.\n\u2022Costs incurred of $12.5 million related to facility damage resulting from a significant rain event in May 2020. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the significant rain event.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $9.9 million during 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to the lower interest rate on the long-term debt issued in December 2019, which was used to repay maturing long-term debt that had a higher interest rate. Also contributing to the decrease was lower interest expense on finance lease liabilities.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased $4.2 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from the 2019 deferral of costs that were offset in other income statement line items and had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher AFUDC-Equity due to continued capital investment and higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 16, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense increased $102.5 million as $44.7 million of income tax expense was recorded during 2020, compared with $57.8 million of income tax benefit recorded during 2019. The increase was primarily due to the benefit from the flow through of tax repairs during 2019, in connection with the 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement, partially offset by the 2020 amortization of the unprotected excess deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation in connection with our Wisconsin rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. The impacts due to the benefit from the flow through of tax repairs and the amortization of the unprotected excess deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation were offset in operating income and did not impact earnings. See Note 13, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>36\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources includes comparisons of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in 2020 Over 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>854.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(630.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(576.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(148.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(278.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n2020 Compared with 2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $87.3 million during 2020, compared with 2019, driven by:\n\u2022A $158.2 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers. This decrease was driven by the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020, including a negative impact related to unprotected excess deferred tax benefits, which we agreed to return to customers. Other contributing factors include lower sales volumes related to business interruptions and closings during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in past due balances due to a moratorium on disconnections, as well as the transfer of Tilden as a customer to UMERC on March 31, 2019.\n\u2022A $55.4 million decrease in cash related to an increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2020, compared with 2019. This increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to a one-time tax deduction for the retirement of a coal plant that occurred in 2019.\nThese decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $74.9 million increase in cash related to lower payments for fuel used at our plants during 2020, compared with 2019, due to lower natural gas costs. The average per-unit cost of natural gas decreased 13.4% during 2020, compared with 2019. Lower fuel costs were also driven by the retirement of PIPP in March 2019 and lower sales volumes. The lower sales volumes were driven by business interruptions and closings during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022An $11.3 million increase in cash from lower payments for other operation and maintenance expenses. Our payments were lower for electric and natural gas distribution expenses, benefits, and transmission during 2020, compared with 2019. See Results of Operations - Utility Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholder for more information.\n\u2022A $10.5 million increase in cash from lower payments for interest during 2020, compared with 2019. Long-term debt issued in December 2019 had a lower interest rate than the long-term debt that matured. Proceeds from the December 2019 debt issuance were used to repay the maturing debt.\n\u2022A $9.0 million increase in cash due to lower collateral requirements, driven by an increase in the fair value of our natural gas derivative assets during 2020, compared with 2019.\n\u2022An $8.9 million increase in cash from lower payments for property and revenue taxes, primarily driven by the Wisconsin gross receipts tax.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>37\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\n2020 Compared with 2019\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $53.9 million during 2020, compared with 2019, driven by a $73.0 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures, which is discussed in more detail below. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by $22.2 million of insurance proceeds received for property damage during 2020. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in 2020 Over 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>663.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>590.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 Compared with 2019\nThe increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2020, compared with 2019, was primarily driven by upgrades to our natural gas distribution systems as well as capital expenditures related to Badger Hollow II and the Solar Now program.\nSee Capital Resources and Requirements - Capital Requirements - Significant Capital Projects below for more information.\nFinancing Activities\n2020 Compared with 2019\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $130.4 million during 2020, compared with 2019, driven by:\n\u2022A $250.0 million increase in cash related to the repayment of long-term debt during 2019. There were no repayments of long-term debt during 2020.\n\u2022A $195.9 million increase in cash related to $176.5 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2020, compared with $19.4 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2019.\n\u2022A $25.0 million increase in equity contributions received from our parent during 2020, compared with 2019, to balance our capital structure.\nThese increases in cash were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $300.0 million decrease in cash related to an issuance of long-term debt during 2019. There were no issuances of long-term debt during 2020.\n\u2022A $35.0 million decrease in cash related to higher dividends paid to our parent during 2020, compared with 2019, to balance our capital structure.\n\u2022A $7.8 million increase in our principal payments for finance lease obligations during 2020, compared with 2019.\nSignificant Financing Activities\nFor more information on our financing activities, see Note 10, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 11, Long-Term Debt.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>38\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nCapital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities, depending on market conditions and other factors, and equity contributions from our parent.\nWe currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds both internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Coronavirus Disease - 2019, for additional information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See Note 10, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on our credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 11, Long-Term Debt, for more information.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $361.8 million. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.\nCredit Rating Risk\nWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and/or Baa3 at Moody's Investors Service, Inc. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to continue to manage any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit rating agencies could place our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrade our credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility.\nSee Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Coronavirus Disease - 2019, for additional information.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>39\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,018.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,623.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6,962.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>799.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>794.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,960.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and transportation purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9,035.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,557.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,307.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,364.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and OPEB funding obligations (7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,540.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,886.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,750.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,901.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,002.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates.\n(2) Principal and interest payments on long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations).\n(3) Finance lease obligations for power purchase commitments, leases with We Power, and land leases related to Badger Hollow II.

Also includes construction obligations related to Badger Hollow II.\n(6) Purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services.\n(7) Obligations for pension and OPEB plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2023.\nThe table above does not reflect estimated future payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $10.3 million at December 31, 2020, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities.\nAROs in the amount of $54.5 million are not included in the above table. Settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years. See Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nObligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.\nSignificant Capital Projects\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>933.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,032.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,375.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,340.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>40\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of spending consists of upgrading our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the AMI program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\nWEC Energy Group is committed to investing in solar, wind, and battery storage. Below are examples of renewable projects that are proposed or currently underway.\n\u2022We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct a utility-scale solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be $130 million. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for December 2022.\n\u2022In February 2021, we, along with WPS and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire and construct the Paris Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin and features 200 MW of solar generation and 110 MW of battery storage. The joint applicants propose that we would acquire a 75% ownership interest, WPS would acquire a 15% ownership interest, and the unaffiliated utility would acquire the remaining 10% ownership interest. If approved, our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $320 million with construction expected to begin in 2022 and completed by the end of 2023.\n\u2022In February 2021, we, along with WPS, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to accelerate capital investments in two wind parks. Our share of the investment is expected to be approximately $85 million to repower major components of BSGF, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.\nWe are constructing approximately 46 miles of natural gas transmission main to increase the quantity and reliability of natural gas service in southeastern Wisconsin. This project, which was approved in a written order by the PSCW in June 2020, has been designated as the Lakeshore Lateral Project. The cost of the project is estimated to be between $174 and $180 million. Construction for the project began in December 2020, and the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\nWe plan to construct a LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, the facility would provide us with approximately one Bcf of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. The facility is expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on our natural gas system during the highest demand days of winter. The project is estimated to cost approximately $185 million. Commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nSee Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Coronavirus Disease - 2019, for information on the impacts to our capital projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCommon Stock Matters\nFor information related to our common stock matters, see Note 8, Common Equity.\nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain OPEB obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We contributed $3.9 million and $5.5 million to our pension and OPEB plans in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. For additional information, see Note 16, Employee Benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including letters of credit that primarily support our commodity contracts. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(q), Guarantees, Note 10, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 18, Variable Interest Entities, for more information.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>41\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCoronavirus Disease - 2019\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO and the CDC and has spread globally, including throughout the United States. There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic itself, as well as the measures currently in place to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, limitations on business operations, and the timing of widespread availability of the vaccines. Although the shelter-in-place order that was in effect for Wisconsin has expired, other orders limiting the capacity of various businesses have been adopted at the state and local levels. In addition, similar or more restrictive orders could be adopted in the future depending on how the virus continues to spread and/or mutate. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses have significantly disrupted economic activity in our service territory. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on our risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLiquidity and Financial Markets\nVolatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and global economy have impacted us in a number of ways. Upon the initial enactment of certain COVID-19 related shelter-in-place orders in early to mid-March 2020, commercial paper markets became more expensive and related terms became less flexible. In response to these signs of market instability, the Federal Reserve implemented certain measures, including a reduction in its benchmark Federal Funds rate and the establishment of various programs to restore liquidity and stability into the short-term funding markets. These measures have had a mitigating effect on commercial paper rates and availability. In addition, the initial disruption in the long-term debt markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nOur overall liquidity position remains strong. As of December 31, 2020, we had $207.0 million available under our credit facility, providing sufficient backing for our commercial paper program.\nPensions and Other Benefits\nOur pension and OPEB plans were 96.7% funded at December 31, 2020, with total plan assets of $1,372.1 million and total benefit obligations of $1,419.2 million. There has been significant volatility in global capital markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the market losses seen during the early stages of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 reversed course throughout the remainder of the year in response to government stimulus and relief efforts and the gradual reopening of businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $135.3 million increase in the value of long-term investments held in our pension and OPEB plan trusts as gains recognized during the last three quarters of 2020 more than offset first quarter losses.\nWe could still see earnings volatility associated with certain other benefit plans maintained by our parent, WEC Energy Group, primarily related to performance units granted to certain of our employees, and deferred compensation plans. Certain of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans are indexed to mutual funds and WEC Energy Group common stock, and the liabilities associated with outstanding performance units are indexed to WEC Energy Group common stock. These liabilities are marked to fair value through earnings each period, with earnings increasing as market prices decrease.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances considering a combination of factors. Risks identified that we do not believe are reflected in historical reserve percentages are assessed on a quarterly basis to determine whether further adjustments are required. Economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher unemployment rates and the inability of some businesses to recover from the pandemic, could cause a higher percentage of accounts receivable to become uncollectible. Although impacts on our results of operations related to uncollectible receivable balances are mitigated by a regulatory mechanism and certain COVID-19 specific regulatory orders we have received, the increase in past due receivables we have experienced has resulted in higher working capital requirements. At December 31, 2020, accounts receivables, net of reserves for credit losses, that were greater than 90 days past due, totaled $56.3 million, a $33.9 million increase compared to December 31, 2019.\nOur exposure to credit losses for certain regulated utility customers is mitigated by a regulatory mechanism we have in place. Specifically, our residential tariffs include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. In addition, we have received specific orders related to the deferral of certain costs (including credit losses) and foregone revenues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>42\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nprotections provided by these COVID-19 specific regulatory orders are still being assessed and will be subject to prudency reviews. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nLoss of Business\nWe have seen a decrease in the consumption of electricity and natural gas by some of our commercial and industrial customers as they continue to experience lower demand for their products and services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many businesses in our service territory still are not operating at full capacity. The extent to which this decrease in consumption will impact our results of operations and liquidity is dependent upon the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ability of our customers to resume and continue normal operations.\nSupply Chain and Capital Projects\nWe have not yet experienced a significant disruption in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if the pandemic significantly impacts our key suppliers' ability to manufacture or deliver critical equipment and supplies or provide services, we could experience delays in our ability to perform certain maintenance and capital project activities.\nWe are not currently aware of any major delays or changes related to our capital plan as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are continuing to monitor potential impacts on an ongoing basis.\nEmployee Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic is paramount and enables us to continue to provide critical services to our customers.\nWe are following CDC guidelines and have taken precautions with regard to employee hygiene and facility cleanliness, imposed travel limitations on our employees, provided additional employee benefits, and implemented remote work policies where appropriate. We have activated an incident management team and updated our pandemic continuity plan, which includes identifying critical work groups and ensuring safe harbor plans are in place. We have minimized the unnecessary risk of exposure to COVID-19 by implementing self-quarantine measures and have adopted additional precautionary measures for our critical work groups.\nAdditional protocols have been implemented for our field employees who travel to customer premises in order to protect them, our customers, and the public. We have modified our work protocols to ensure compliance with social distancing and face covering recommendations.\nAll of these safety measures have caused us to incur additional costs, and depending upon the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe have taken actions to ensure that essential utility services are available to our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the PSCW has issued written orders requiring certain actions by all public utilities in the state of Wisconsin. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on these orders and the potential recovery of expenditures incurred as a result of the measures being taken.\nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\nRegulatory Recovery\nWe account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by the PSCW and the FERC. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on our rates. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for additional information regarding recent rate proceedings and orders.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>43\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to generic and/or specific orders issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by our regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, our regulatory assets were $2,803.3 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $1,707.9 million.\nDue to the Tax Legislation, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $1,102 million. We have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through bill credits and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See Note 13, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information on our mechanism that allows for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.\nDue to the cold temperatures, wind, snow and ice throughout the central part of the country during February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas utility customers was temporarily driven higher than our normal winter weather expectations. We have a regulatory mechanism in place for recovering all prudently incurred gas costs. In addition, we have adequate liquidity and access to capital markets to manage any short-term increase in working capital resulting from the lag in recovery. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.\nWeather\nOur utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2020 and 2019, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt.\nBased on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $2.9 million and $1.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>44\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by the PSCW.\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Return on Assets in 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension trust funds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,127.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPEB trust funds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\nWEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\nInflation\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.\nFor additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>45\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nDue to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a third-party supplier or us. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates.\nWe offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. We offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is substantially offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. We are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\nOther Matters\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. In May 2018, the PSCW issued a written order regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers in Wisconsin. The various remaining impacts of the Tax Legislation on our Wisconsin operations were addressed in the rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019. The MPSC also approved a settlement in May 2018 with Tilden that addressed all base rate impacts of the Tax Legislation. Tilden owns the iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that we provided retail electric service to prior to April 1, 2019. In addition, the FERC approved our revised formula rate tariff that incorporated the impacts of the Tax Legislation in August 2020. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the PSCW's and MPSC's response to the Tax Legislation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.\nThe following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>46\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets, including the timeliness of recovery and our ability to earn a reasonable return, is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2,803.3 million in regulatory assets and $1,707.9 million in regulatory liabilities. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. Long-lived assets that would be subject to an impairment assessment would generally include any assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future.\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery or a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.\nThe Pleasant Prairie power plant was retired during 2018 and PIPP was retired during 2019. Effective with our rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019, we received approval to collect a return of and on the entire net book value of the PIPP. We will collect a full return of the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, and a return on all but $100 million of the net book value. In accordance with our PSCW rate order received in December 2019, we filed an application with the PSCW on July 20, 2020 requesting a financing order to securitize the remaining $100 million of the Pleasant Prairie power plant's book value related to certain environmental controls, plus the carrying costs accrued on the $100 million during the securitization process and related fees. On November 17, 2020, the PSCW issued a written order approving the application. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 16, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>47\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded through the rate-making process.\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage-Point Change in Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on 2020\nPension Cost </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>(60.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost.

From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 6.75% in 2020, and 7.00% in 2019 and 2018. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 10.72%, 15.83%, and (2.91)%, in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 16, Employee Benefits.\nUnbilled Revenues\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2020 of approximately $3.4 billion included unbilled utility revenues of $203.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>48\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\ndifferences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(n), Income Taxes, and Note 13, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.\nWe expect our 2021 annual effective tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13.5%, which includes an estimated 10.5% effective tax rate benefit due to the amortization of unprotected excess deferred taxes in connection with our 2019 Wisconsin rate order. Excluding this estimated effective tax rate benefit, the expected 2021 range would be between 23% and 24%.", "summary": "The report is from Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which focuses on distributing electricity and natural gas to retail and wholesale customers.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and derive revenues from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nPrior to April 1, 2019, we provided electric service to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This customer was transferred to UMERC on April 1, 2019 after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. WEC Energy Group's 2021-2025 capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as its ESG Progress Plan, provides a roadmap to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow WEC Energy Group's and our investment in the future of energy.\nThroughout its strategic planning process, WEC Energy Group takes into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and commodity prices, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability. WEC Energy Group published the results of a priority sustainability issue assessment in 2020, identifying the issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders over the short and long terms. This risk and priority assessment has formed WEC Energy Group's direction as a company.\nCreating a Sustainable Future\nWEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with the construction of zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation and clean natural gas-fired generation at its electric utilities including us. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance supply with demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electric generation.\nIn 2019, WEC Energy Group met and surpassed its original goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. In July 2020, WEC Energy Group announced new goals to reduce CO2 emissions from its electric generation by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to be net carbon neutral by 2050. It also added a near-term goal in November 2020 to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% below 2005 levels by 2025.\nWEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. As part of the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,800 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by 2025.\nIn addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, WEC Energy Group expects to invest approximately $2 billion from 2021-2025 in low-cost renewable energy in Wisconsin. WEC Energy Group's plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation and zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following new investments made by either us or WPS based on specific customer needs:\n\u2022800 MW of utility-scale solar;\n\u2022600 MW of battery storage;\n\u2022100 MW of wind;\n\u2022100 MW of reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) natural gas-fueled generation; and\n\n\u2022the planned purchase of 200 MW of capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center - a new, combined-cycle natural gas plant recently completed by Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.\nThese new investments discussed above are in addition to the renewable projects currently underway.\nWe have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct Badger Hollow Solar Park II that is expected to enter commercial operation in December 2022. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of this project.\nIn December 2018, we received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, we have energized 13 Solar Now projects and currently have another five under construction, together totaling more than 15 MW. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that we would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\nWEC Energy Group also has a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in its networks by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. WEC Energy Group was over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with the ESG Progress Plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to operating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies being recognized in 2020 by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, for superior reliability of its electric delivery network. This was the 10th consecutive year that We Energies has been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest. We Energies is the trade name under which we and Wisconsin Gas LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, operate.\nBelow are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed or currently underway.\n\u2022We are constructing approximately 46 miles of natural gas transmission main to increase the quantity and reliability of natural gas service in southeastern Wisconsin. This project, called the Lakeshore Lateral Project, is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\n\u2022We plan to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to meet anticipated peak demand. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company and will continue to do so under the ESG Progress Plan. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating the resources of all of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\n\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nA multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across all of the WEC Energy Group companies. It has moved all utilities, including us, to a common platform for all customer-facing self-service options. Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers.\nSafety\nAcross the organization, we monitor the integrity of our networks and conduct comprehensive incident response planning to enhance the safety of our operations.\nUnder our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective December 31, 2020, we changed our measure of segment profitability from operating income to net income attributed to common shareholder. As no items were reported in our other segment during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, a similar discussion that compares our results for these years can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations in Part II of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Earnings\nOur earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $365.6 million, compared to $362.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See below for additional information on the $3.5 million increase in earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the contribution of our utility segment to net income attributed to common shareholder. The discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator\n\nof operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $860.5 million and $760.2 million, respectively. The discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income.\nUtility Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholder\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:\n\n(1) Represents transmission expense that we are authorized to collect in rates, in accordance with the PSCW's approval of escrow accounting for ATC and MISO network transmission expenses. As a result, we defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. During 2020 and 2019, $314.6 million and $329.4 million, respectively, of costs were billed to us by transmission providers.\n(2) Represents costs associated with the We Power generation units, including operating and maintenance costs we recognized. During 2020 and 2019, $115.1 million and $134.8 million, respectively, of costs were billed to or incurred by us related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.\n(3) Regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on net income.\n\n(4) Represents additional transmission expense recorded in 2019 associated with the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities starting in 2018 in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW, to maintain certain regulatory asset balances at their December 31, 2017 levels. This decrease in expenses was offset in income taxes. Since our transmission regulatory asset was eliminated at December 31, 2019, there were no tax benefits used in 2020.\n(5) Represents additional transmission expense recorded in 2019 associated with the May 2018 PSCW order requiring us to use 80% of our current 2018 tax benefit, including the amortization associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes, to reduce our transmission regulatory asset balance. Since our transmission regulatory asset was eliminated at December 31, 2019, there were no tax benefits used in 2020.\n(6) See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information about our earnings sharing mechanism.\nThe following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:\n\n\n\n(1) Normal degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n2020 Compared with 2019\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $26.5 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n\u2022An $82.8 million net decrease in margins related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This decrease in margins includes a $62.8 million negative impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to return to customers and is offset in income taxes.\n\n\u2022A $23.9 million decrease in margins from other revenues, primarily related to lower revenues from third party use of our assets.\n\u2022A $12.4 million net decrease in margins related to lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather. We recognized a $27.6 million net reduction in margins related to lower retail sales volumes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes for our commercial and industrial customers decreased, primarily related to business interruptions and closings, while residential sales volumes increased. These changes in volumes were both driven, in large part, by a shelter-in-place order issued by the state of Wisconsin, which was in effect from March 25, 2020 through April 24, 2020, as well as the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This net decrease in margins was partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in margins driven by warmer summer weather. As measured by cooling degree days, 2020 was 29.0% warmer than 2019.\n\u2022A $6.8 million decrease in margins related to lower wholesale sales volumes, driven by lower sales to UMERC. UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation on March 31, 2019, at which time we stopped providing wholesale services to UMERC.\n\u2022A $4.8 million decrease in margins from our steam operations driven by lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather.\n\u2022A $4.4 million decrease in margins related to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tilden was our customer but became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019.\nThese decreases in margins were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $101.8 million increase in margins associated with the 2019 negative impact of the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW to maintain certain regulatory assets at their December 31, 2017 levels. These tax benefits were no longer in effect for 2020. This increase in margins was offset in income taxes. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022An $8.6 million year-over-year positive impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our margins are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are within a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance beyond the 2% variance is deferred for future recovery or refund to customers.\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $12.8 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was a $20.5 million increase related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This increase in margins includes a $5.3 million positive impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to collect from customers and is offset in income taxes.\nThis increase in margins was partially offset by a $10.5 million net reduction in margins related to lower sales volumes, driven primarily by warmer winter weather during 2020. As measured by heating degree days, 2020 was 10.9% warmer than 2019. Natural gas utility margins were not impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\nOther operating expenses at the utility segment decreased $114.0 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses were:\n\u2022A $67.2 million decrease in transmission expense related to the flow through of tax repairs during 2019, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes.\n\u2022A $65.2 million decrease in transmission expense associated with the May 2018 order from the PSCW related to our required treatment of the tax benefits associated with the Tax Legislation, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset by a corresponding decrease in margins.\n\n\u2022A $38.6 million decrease in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022A $32.8 million decrease in regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $21.7 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, driven by lower maintenance and storm restoration expense, as well as our focus on operating efficiency.\n\u2022A $21.6 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to the We Power leases, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $15.6 million decrease in benefit costs, primarily due to lower deferred compensation costs, stock-based compensation, and medical costs.\nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n\u2022An $83.0 million increase in transmission expense as approved in the PSCW's 2019 rate order, which was effective January 1, 2020. See the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above for more information.\n\u2022A $42.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan as well as an increase related to the We Power leases.\n\u2022A $15.3 million net increase in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by changes to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2019 Wisconsin rate order. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the Wisconsin rate orders. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operation and maintenance at our plants, driven by the retirement of PIPP in March 2019 and reduced operation of the OCPP.\n\u2022Costs incurred of $12.5 million related to facility damage resulting from a significant rain event in May 2020. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the significant rain event.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $9.9 million during 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to the lower interest rate on the long-term debt issued in December 2019, which was used to repay maturing long-term debt that had a higher interest rate. Also contributing to the decrease was lower interest expense on finance lease liabilities.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased $4.2 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from the 2019 deferral of costs that were offset in other income statement line items and had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher AFUDC-Equity due to continued capital investment and higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 16, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense increased $102.5 million as $44.7 million", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and derive revenues from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 17, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nPrior to April 1, 2019, we provided electric service to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This customer was transferred to UMERC on April 1, 2019 after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. WEC Energy Group's 2021-2025 capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as its ESG Progress Plan, provides a roadmap to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow WEC Energy Group's and our investment in the future of energy.\nThroughout its strategic planning process, WEC Energy Group takes into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and commodity prices, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability. WEC Energy Group published the results of a priority sustainability issue assessment in 2020, identifying the issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders over the short and long terms. This risk and priority assessment has formed WEC Energy Group's direction as a company.\nCreating a Sustainable Future\nWEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with the construction of zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation and clean natural gas-fired generation at its electric utilities including us. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance supply with demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electric generation.\nIn 2019, WEC Energy Group met and surpassed its original goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. In July 2020, WEC Energy Group announced new goals to reduce CO2 emissions from its electric generation by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to be net carbon neutral by 2050. It also added a near-term goal in November 2020 to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% below 2005 levels by 2025.\nWEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirement of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. See See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. As part of the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,800 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by 2025.\nIn addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, WEC Energy Group expects to invest approximately $2 billion from 2021-2025 in low-cost renewable energy in Wisconsin. WEC Energy Group's plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation and zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following new investments made by either us or WPS based on specific customer needs:\n\u2022800 MW of utility-scale solar;\n\u2022600 MW of battery storage;\n\u2022100 MW of wind;\n\u2022100 MW of reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) natural gas-fueled generation; and\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>30\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022the planned purchase of 200 MW of capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center - a new, combined-cycle natural gas plant recently completed by Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.\nThese new investments discussed above are in addition to the renewable projects currently underway.\nWe have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct Badger Hollow Solar Park II that is expected to enter commercial operation in December 2022. Once constructed, we will own 100 MW of this project.\nIn December 2018, we received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to our portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, we have energized 13 Solar Now projects and currently have another five under construction, together totaling more than 15 MW. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that we would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\nWEC Energy Group also has a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in its networks by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. WEC Energy Group was over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with the ESG Progress Plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to operating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies being recognized in 2020 by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, for superior reliability of its electric delivery network. This was the 10th consecutive year that We Energies has been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest. We Energies is the trade name under which we and Wisconsin Gas LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, operate.\nBelow are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed or currently underway.\n\u2022We are constructing approximately 46 miles of natural gas transmission main to increase the quantity and reliability of natural gas service in southeastern Wisconsin. This project, called the Lakeshore Lateral Project, is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\n\u2022We plan to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to meet anticipated peak demand. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation of the LNG facility is targeted for the end of 2023.\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company and will continue to do so under the ESG Progress Plan. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating the resources of all of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>31\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nA multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across all of the WEC Energy Group companies. It has moved all utilities, including us, to a common platform for all customer-facing self-service options. Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers.\nSafety\nAcross the organization, we monitor the integrity of our networks and conduct comprehensive incident response planning to enhance the safety of our operations.\nUnder our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective December 31, 2020, we changed our measure of segment profitability from operating income to net income attributed to common shareholder. As no items were reported in our other segment during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, a similar discussion that compares our results for these years can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations in Part II of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Earnings\nOur earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $365.6 million, compared to $362.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See below for additional information on the $3.5 million increase in earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the contribution of our utility segment to net income attributed to common shareholder. The discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>32\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\nof operating performance.

Since our transmission regulatory asset was eliminated at December 31, 2019, there were no tax benefits used in 2020.\n(6) See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information about our earnings sharing mechanism.\nThe following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MWh (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Sales Volumes </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>B (W) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer class </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>8,239.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,818.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Small commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>8,216.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,701.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(484.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>6,422.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,221.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(798.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>129.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail </td> <td> </td> <td>23,008.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,876.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(867.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,298.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(245.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resale </td> <td> </td> <td>5,382.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,213.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales in MWh </td> <td> </td> <td>29,443.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,388.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(944.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Therms (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Sales Volumes </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>B (W) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer class </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td>367.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>404.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>198.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retail </td> <td> </td> <td>565.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>629.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transport </td> <td> </td> <td>311.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>343.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales in therms </td> <td> </td> <td>876.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>972.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Degree Days </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>B (W) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating (6,618 normal) </td> <td> </td> <td>6,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling (737 normal) </td> <td> </td> <td>938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Normal degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n2020 Compared with 2019\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $26.5 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n\u2022An $82.8 million net decrease in margins related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This decrease in margins includes a $62.8 million negative impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to return to customers and is offset in income taxes.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>34\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022A $23.9 million decrease in margins from other revenues, primarily related to lower revenues from third party use of our assets.\n\u2022A $12.4 million net decrease in margins related to lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather. We recognized a $27.6 million net reduction in margins related to lower retail sales volumes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes for our commercial and industrial customers decreased, primarily related to business interruptions and closings, while residential sales volumes increased. These changes in volumes were both driven, in large part, by a shelter-in-place order issued by the state of Wisconsin, which was in effect from March 25, 2020 through April 24, 2020, as well as the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This net decrease in margins was partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in margins driven by warmer summer weather. As measured by cooling degree days, 2020 was 29.0% warmer than 2019.\n\u2022A $6.8 million decrease in margins related to lower wholesale sales volumes, driven by lower sales to UMERC. UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan began commercial operation on March 31, 2019, at which time we stopped providing wholesale services to UMERC.\n\u2022A $4.8 million decrease in margins from our steam operations driven by lower sales volumes, including the impact of weather.\n\u2022A $4.4 million decrease in margins related to Tilden, who owns an iron ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tilden was our customer but became a customer of UMERC after UMERC's new natural gas-fired generating units began commercial operation on March 31, 2019.\nThese decreases in margins were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $101.8 million increase in margins associated with the 2019 negative impact of the flow through of tax benefits of our repair-related deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW to maintain certain regulatory assets at their December 31, 2017 levels. These tax benefits were no longer in effect for 2020. This increase in margins was offset in income taxes. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022An $8.6 million year-over-year positive impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our margins are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are within a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance beyond the 2% variance is deferred for future recovery or refund to customers.\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $12.8 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was a $20.5 million increase related to the impact of our rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. This increase in margins includes a $5.3 million positive impact related to unprotected excess deferred taxes, which we agreed to collect from customers and is offset in income taxes.\nThis increase in margins was partially offset by a $10.5 million net reduction in margins related to lower sales volumes, driven primarily by warmer winter weather during 2020. As measured by heating degree days, 2020 was 10.9% warmer than 2019. Natural gas utility margins were not impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\nOther operating expenses at the utility segment decreased $114.0 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses were:\n\u2022A $67.2 million decrease in transmission expense related to the flow through of tax repairs during 2019, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes.\n\u2022A $65.2 million decrease in transmission expense associated with the May 2018 order from the PSCW related to our required treatment of the tax benefits associated with the Tax Legislation, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset by a corresponding decrease in margins.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td>35\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Electric Power Company </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022A $38.6 million decrease in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\u2022A $32.8 million decrease in regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $21.7 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, driven by lower maintenance and storm restoration expense, as well as our focus on operating efficiency.\n\u2022A $21.6 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to the We Power leases, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\u2022A $15.6 million decrease in benefit costs, primarily due to lower deferred compensation costs, stock-based compensation, and medical costs.\nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n\u2022An $83.0 million increase in transmission expense as approved in the PSCW's 2019 rate order, which was effective January 1, 2020. See the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above for more information.\n\u2022A $42.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan as well as an increase related to the We Power leases.\n\u2022A $15.3 million net increase in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by changes to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2019 Wisconsin rate order. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the Wisconsin rate orders. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operation and maintenance at our plants, driven by the retirement of PIPP in March 2019 and reduced operation of the OCPP.\n\u2022Costs incurred of $12.5 million related to facility damage resulting from a significant rain event in May 2020. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the significant rain event.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $9.9 million during 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to the lower interest rate on the long-term debt issued in December 2019, which was used to repay maturing long-term debt that had a higher interest rate. Also contributing to the decrease was lower interest expense on finance lease liabilities.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net decreased $4.2 million during 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from the 2019 deferral of costs that were offset in other income statement line items and had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholder. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher AFUDC-Equity due to continued capital investment and higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 16, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense increased $102.5 million as $44.7 million"}
