Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" as well as the information contained in \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.\n2020 illustrated the importance of a focused strategic plan and a dynamic team as we faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year can be viewed in two clear and separate halves. The first half of 2020 was a period of steady execution against our strategic roadmap. We began the year focused on strengthening our brand powerhouse, with two distinct divisions concentrated in North America: Meals & Beverages and Snacks; each home to strong portfolios of products. We kicked off our Win in Soup\u201d strategic plan and completed our planned divestitures of our Campbell International and European chips business, using the proceeds to reduce our leverage while implementing a new operating model to optimize growth and profitability. The groundwork we established in the first half of 2020 served as a springboard for the business into the second half of the year, when progress against our strategy accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America during the second half of 2020, we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our Meals & Beverages and Snacks segments, especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets. This result was attributable to a change in retail demand, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption, which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period. We also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products, especially in our soup business. The higher sales trends of our retail products may lessen or reverse in 2021 if customers or consumers alter their purchasing habits.\nIn response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. During the second half of 2020, we also experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nOverall, we benefited from increased product demand and favorable product mix as we leveraged our supply chain assets to respond to the impact of the pandemic. Consequently, our full-year results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for net sales and earnings from continuing operations.\nIn 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, our Garden Fresh Gourmet business and our Bolthouse Farms business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Campbell Fresh reportable segment. A portion of the U.S. refrigerated soup business historically included in Campbell Fresh was retained and is now reported in Meals & Beverages.\nAs discussed above, we completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019. On December 23, 2019, we completed the sale of our Arnott's business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in Australia and Asia Pacific (the Arnott's and other international operations). Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott's and other international operations (collectively referred to as Campbell International) as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Snacks reportable segment. In addition, on October 11, 2019, we completed the sale of our European chips business. The results of the European chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the Snacks reportable segment. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these divestitures and reportable segments.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2019, our retail business in Latin America was managed as part of the Meals & Beverages segment. Beginning in 2020, our business in Latin America is managed as part of the Snacks segment. Segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to deliver profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Real food that matters for life's moments. Our strategic plan is based on four pillars: create a profitable growth model; fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings; build a winning team and culture; and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below.\nWe plan to continue to build upon our consumer and customer engagement models, which we believe will enhance our profitable growth model. We plan to do this through the development of more consumer-oriented product quality, marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles. In addition, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of our snacks business while also investing in U.S. soup and our other core brands.\nWe also expect to continue pursuing our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). We expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization, organization consolidation and integration, procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories. See \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information on these initiatives.\nWe also plan to focus on building a winning team and culture by improving our employee experience, advancing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities that support our core brands in North America. In addition, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives, progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a competitive and dynamic retail environment; and cost inflation.\nOur strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. We also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods as well as plant-based foods.\nRetailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products. Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which prior to the pandemic, had experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade. Although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future, we anticipate that the growth of e-commerce, including omnichannel click and collect models, as well as alternative retail channels, such as club and dollar stores, to continue.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in increased demand for our retail products, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption. In response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. The continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting government stay-at-home orders in the United States in 2021 may continue to drive consumer demand for our products, which may be in excess of our ability to supply. In mitigating supply chain risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nThe cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs. Despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future with any certainty, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021.\nSummary of Results\nThis Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.\nThere were 53 weeks in 2020. There were 52 weeks in 2019 and 2018.\n\u2022Net sales increased 7% in 2020 to $8,691 million, primarily due to gains in Meals & Beverages and Snacks. The 53rd week contributed 2 points of growth, which was mostly offset by the impact of the divestiture of the European chips business. As a result of COVID-19, net sales accelerated in our retail products in the second half of 2020 with increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption, partly offset by declines in foodservice as a result of shifts in consumer behavior and continued COVID-19 restrictions.\n\u2022Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 34.5% in 2020 from 33.2% a year ago. The increase was primarily due to supply chain productivity improvements, cost savings initiatives, favorable product mix and operating leverage, partly offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including the impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022Interest expense decreased to $345 million in 2020 from $356 million a year ago. The current year included a loss of $75 million related to extinguishment of debt. After adjusting for this item, interest expense declined primarily due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio.\n\u2022Earnings from continuing operations per share were $1.95 in 2020, compared to $1.57 a year ago. The current and prior year included expenses of $1.01 and $.74 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.\n\u2022Earnings from discontinued operations per share were $3.41 in the 2020, compared to a Loss per share of $.87 a year ago. The current year included gains of $3.29 and the prior year included expenses of $1.18 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.\nNet Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2020 Compared with 2019\nThe following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:\nContinuing Operations\n\u2022In 2020, we recognized losses of $121 million in Other expenses / (income) ($92 million after tax, $.30 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In 2019, we recognized losses of $122 million in Other expenses / (income) ($93 million after tax, or $.31 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;\n\u2022In 2020, we recognized pre-tax pension settlement charges in Other expenses / (income) of $43 million ($33 million after tax, or $.11 per share) associated with U.S. and Canadian pension plans. In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax pension settlement charge in Other expenses / (income) of $28 million ($22 million after tax, or $.07 per share) associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plans' assets;\n\u2022We implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years. In 2020, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $9 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $48 million in Administrative expenses, $9 million in Cost of products sold, $2 million in Marketing and selling expenses, and $1 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $52 million after tax, or $.17 per share) related to these initiatives. In 2019, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $31 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $62 million in Administrative expenses, $18 million in Cost of products sold, $7 million in Marketing and selling expenses, and $3 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $92 million after tax, or $.30 per share) related to these initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information;\n\u2022On April 26, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our limited partnership interest in Acre Venture Partnerships, L.P. (Acre). The transaction closed on May 8, 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a loss in Other expenses / (income) of $45 million ($35 million after tax, or $.12 per share) as a result of the pending sale. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information;\n\u2022In 2020, we recorded a loss in Other expenses / (income) of $64 million ($37 million after tax, or $.12 per share) on the sale of our European chips business;\n\u2022In 2020, we recorded a loss in Interest expense of $75 million ($57 million after tax, or $.19 per share) on the extinguishment of debt;\n\u2022In 2019, we recorded a tax charge of $2 million ($.01 per share) related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings under the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Taxes on Earnings\" for additional information; and\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed an assessment on the assets within the European chips business and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $16 million ($13 million after tax, or $.04 per share) on intangible assets in Other expenses / (income). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\u2022In 2020, we recognized pre-tax net gains of $1,039 million ($1,000 million after tax, or $3.29 per share) associated with the sale of Campbell International. In 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of Campbell Fresh, including transaction costs. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million as deferred tax assets on Bolthouse Farms were not realizable. The aggregate impact was $51 million after tax, or $.17 per share. In 2019, we also incurred costs of $12 million ($10 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with the planned divestiture of Campbell International. The total aggregate impact was $61 million after tax, or $.20 per share;\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized losses of $12 million ($9 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension plans; and\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in Kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business. The aggregate impact was $17 million ($12 million after tax, or $.04 per share).\nIn the second quarter of 2019, interim impairment assessments were performed on the intangible and tangible assets within Campbell Fresh, which included Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses. We revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses as the divestiture process progressed. We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $104 million on the tangible assets and $73 million on the intangible assets of Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients; $96 million on the intangible assets and $9 million on the tangible assets of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings; and $62 million on the intangible assets and $2 million on the tangible assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $346 million ($264 million after tax, or $.87 per share).\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share) on our U.S. refrigerated soup plant assets.\nIn 2019, total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $377 million ($287 million after tax, or $.95 per share).\nThe items impacting comparability are summarized below:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

operations were $592 million ($1.95 per share) in 2020, compared to $474 million ($1.57 per share) in 2019. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased reflecting sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, an improved gross profit performance and lower interest expense, partially offset by increased marketing investment. The additional week contributed approximately $.04 per share to Earnings from continuing operations in 2020.\nSee \"Discontinued Operations\" for additional information.\nNet Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2019 Compared with 2018\nIn addition to the 2019 items that impacted comparability of Net earnings discussed above, the following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:\nContinuing Operations\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized gains of $131 million in Other expenses / (income) ($100 million after tax, or $.33 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $42 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $87 million in Administrative expenses, $45 million in Cost of products sold, and $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $132 million after tax, or $.44 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information;\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $179 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a tax charge of $53 million related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings under the enactment of the Act. The net impact was a tax benefit of $126 million ($.42 per share). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Taxes on Earnings\" for additional information;\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed an impairment assessment on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after tax, or $.14 per share) in Other expenses / (income). See \"Significant Accounting Estimates\" for additional information;\n\u2022In the second quarter of 2018, we announced our intent to acquire Snyder's-Lance and on March 26, 2018, the acquisition closed. In 2018, we incurred $120 million of transaction and integration costs, of which $13 million was recorded in Restructuring charges, $12 million in Administrative expenses, $53 million in Other expenses / (income), and $42 million in Cost of products sold associated with an acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. We also recorded a gain in Interest expense of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the acquisition. The aggregate impact was $102 million, $73 million after tax, or $.24 per share; and\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded expense of $22 million in Other expenses / (income) ($15 million after tax, or $.05 per share) from a settlement of a legal claim.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized gains of $5 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments for defined benefit pension plans;\n\u2022In the third quarter of 2018, we performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, we revised our long-term outlook due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with certain private label customers, as well as the performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was below expectations. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11 million on the tangible assets and $94 million on the intangible assets ($80 million after tax, or $.27 per share) of the deli reporting unit, and a non-cash impairment charge of $514 million ($417 million after tax, or $1.39 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $619 million ($497 million after tax, or $1.65 per share).\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. We revised our outlook for future earnings and cash flows and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $75 million ($74 million after tax, or $.25 per share).\nIn 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $694 million ($571 million after tax, or $1.89 per share); and\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $7 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $1 million in Administrative expenses (aggregate impact of $4 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above.

After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased reflecting higher interest expense, partly offset by a lower adjusted tax rate as incremental earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from the Snyder's-Lance acquisition were mostly offset by declines in EBIT in the base business.\nSee \"Discontinued Operations\" for additional information.\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nSales\nAn analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meals & Beverages </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Snacks </td> <td>4,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________\nn/m -

Excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased primarily due to gains in the U.S. retail business driven by U.S. soup, Prego pasta sauces and V8 beverages, as well as gains in Canada, partially offset by declines in foodservice. Volume and mix increased in the retail business driven by COVID-19, with increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the second half of 2020. The foodservice business was negatively impacted by shifts in consumer behavior and continued COVID-19 related restrictions, as well as the loss of a refrigerated soup contract. Including a 2-point benefit from the additional week, sales of U.S. soup increased 14% due to gains in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups and broth.\nIn 2019, Meals & Beverages sales were comparable with prior year reflecting a 2-point benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, LLC (Pacific Foods), partially offset by declines in U.S. soup, the retail business in Canada driven by the negative impact of currency translation and Prego pasta sauces. Excluding Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup decreased 2% due to declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth. The decline in U.S. soup was driven primarily by continued competitive pressure across the market as well as increased promotional spending.\nIn 2020, Snacks sales increased 5%. Excluding the impact of the European chips divestiture and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased driven by volume gains reflecting increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the second half of 2020, as well as base business performance. The sales increases reflect gains in Goldfish crackers, Pepperidge Farm cookies and fresh bakery products, as well as Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips, Late July snacks and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels.\nIn 2019, Snacks sales increased 62% with a 59-point benefit of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, sales increased reflecting growth in Pepperidge Farm, with gains in Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery products and in cookies, as well as Kettle Brand potato chips, Late July snacks and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps.\nGross Profit\nGross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $306 million in 2020 from 2019 and increased by $319 million in 2019 from 2018. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 34.5% in 2020, 33.2% in 2019 and 35.9% in 2018.\nThe 1.3 percentage-point increase and the 2.7 percentage-point decrease in gross profit percentage in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were due to the following factors:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Margin Impact </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Productivity improvements </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mix </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price and sales allowances </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower restructuring-related costs </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher level of promotional spending </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost inflation, supply chain costs and other factors(1)\n</td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>1.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________\n(1)2020 includes an estimated positive margin impact of 1.3 from the benefit of cost savings initiatives and operating leverage, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19. 2019 includes a positive margin impact of 0.8 from cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including higher than expected distribution costs associated with the startup of a new distribution facility in Findlay, Ohio, operated by a third-party logistics provider.\nMarketing and Selling Expenses\nMarketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 10.9% in 2020, 10.4% in 2019 and 11.0% in 2018. Marketing and selling expenses increased 12% in 2020 from 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 14 percentage points); higher selling expenses (approximately 2 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 1 percentage point); and higher costs related to marketing overhead (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 percentage points) and lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses was primarily in Meals & Beverages due to increased support of U.S. soup, and in Snacks due to increased support of key brands.\nMarketing and selling expenses increased 16% in 2019 from 2018. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 19 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 2 percentage points) and higher costs related to costs savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points) and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 3 percentage points). The reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses was primarily in Meals & Beverages, reflecting a reallocation from advertising to promotional spending classified as revenue reductions, reduced support levels in light of distribution challenges faced in the first quarter and a later start to our U.S. soup campaign relative to 2018.\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.2% in 2020, 7.5% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2018. Administrative expenses increased 2% in 2020 from 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation (approximately 4 percentage points); higher information technology costs (approximately 3 percentage points); higher inflation and general administrative costs (approximately 3 percentage points) and increases in charitable contributions (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 8 percentage points) and lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points).\nAdministrative expenses increased 8% in 2019 from 2018. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 10 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 7 percentage points); and costs associated with the proxy contest (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives inclusive of acquisition integration costs (approximately 7 percentage points) and increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points).\nOther Expenses / (Income)\nOther expenses in 2020 included the following:\n\u2022$73 million of net periodic benefit expense, including losses of $121 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments and pension settlement charges of $43 million associated with U.S. and Canadian pension plans;\n\u2022$64 million loss on the sale of the European chips business;\n\u2022$45 million loss on Acre; and\n\u2022$43 million of amortization of intangible assets.\nOther expenses in 2019 included the following:\n\u2022$71 million of net periodic benefit expense, including losses of $122 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments and a pension settlement charge of $28 million associated with a U.S. pension plan;\n\u2022$48 million of amortization of intangible assets; and\n\u2022$16 million non-cash impairment charge related to the European chips business.\nOther income in 2018 included the following:\n\u2022$225 million of net periodic benefit income, including gains of $131 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;\n\u2022$20 million of amortization of intangible assets;\n\u2022$22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim;\n\u2022$53 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance; and\n\u2022$54 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Plum trademark.\nFor additional information on the impairment charges, see \"Significant Accounting Estimates.\"\nOperating Earnings\nSegment operating earnings increased 8% in 2020 from 2019 and increased 3% in 2019 from 2018.\nAn analysis of operating earnings by segment follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meals & Beverages </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Snacks </td> <td> </td> <td>551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(306) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest and taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________________\n(1)See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.\nOperating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 10% in 2020 versus 2019. The increase was primarily due to sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, and improved gross profit performance, partially offset by increased marketing support and higher administrative expenses. Gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, as well as improved operating leverage and favorable product mix, partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including COVID-19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020.\nOperating earnings from Meals & Beverages decreased 9% in 2019 versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs, as well as higher promotional spending and higher incentive compensation expenses, partly offset by supply chain productivity improvements, lower marketing and selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives.\nOperating earnings from Snacks increased 6% in 2020 versus 2019. The increase primarily due to sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, improved gross profit performance, partially offset by increased marketing support. Gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, as well as favorable product mix and improved operating leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including COVID-19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020.\nOperating earnings from Snacks increased 33% in 2019 versus 2018. The increase reflects a 31-point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales, supply chain productivity improvements and lower promotional spending, partly offset by higher marketing and selling expenses, higher levels of cost inflation and higher incentive compensation expenses. Operating earnings benefited from lapping the costs associated with the voluntary product recall of Flavor Blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.\nCorporate in 2020 included the following:\n\u2022$121 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;\n\u2022a loss of $64 million from the sale of the European chips business;\n\u2022costs of $60 million related to the cost savings initiatives;\n\u2022a loss of $45 million on Acre; and\n\u2022pension settlement charges of $43 million associated with U.S. and Canadian pension plans.\nCorporate in 2019 included the following:\n\u2022$122 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;\n\u2022costs of $90 million related to the cost savings initiatives;\n\u2022a pension settlement charge of $28 million associated with a U.S. pension plan; and\n\u2022non-cash impairment charge of $16 million related to the European chips business.\nCorporate in 2018 included the following:\n\u2022costs of $135 million related to the cost savings initiatives;\n\u2022transaction and integration costs of $107 million associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance;\n\u2022non-cash impairment charge of $54 million related to the Plum trademark;\n\u2022$22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim; and\n\u2022$131 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments.\nExcluding these amounts, the remaining decrease in costs in 2020 primarily reflects higher other income and lower administrative expenses.\nExcluding these amounts, the remaining increase in costs in 2019 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $345 million in 2020 from $356 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $75 million.\nInterest expense increased to $356 million in 2019 from $183 million in 2018. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions, higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio and a gain of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts in 2018 used to hedge the planned financing of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition.\nTaxes on Earnings\nThe effective tax rate was 22.7% in 2020, 24.2% in 2019 and 12.8% in 2018.\nThe decrease in the effective rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the tax benefit on the sale of the European chips business.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation. As a result, the following items are reflected in 2018:\n\u2022The corporate rate reduction as of January 1, 2018, resulted in a blended U.S. statutory tax rate of approximately 27%;\n\u2022Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $179 million; and\n\u2022Imposition of a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings resulted in a tax charge of $53 million.\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTax expense increased from $106 million in 2018 to $151 million in 2019.\nThe following items impacted 2019 and 2018:\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $29 million on $122 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market losses. In 2018, we recognized tax expense of $31 million on $131 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market gains;\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on $28 million of a pension settlement charge;\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $121 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs. In 2018, we recognized a $45 million tax benefit on $177 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs;\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings of $2 million related to the enactment of the Act. In 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $126 million related to the enactment of the Act on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings described above;\n\u2022In 2019, we recognized a $3 million tax benefit on a $16 million impairment charge on the European chips business. In 2018, we recognized a $13 million tax benefit on a $54 million impairment charge on the Plum trademark;\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $102 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance; and\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized a $7 million tax benefit on the $22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim.\nAfter adjusting for the items above, the remaining decrease in the effective rate in 2019 was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower U.S. federal tax rate resulting from the enactment of the Act.\nRestructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\nMulti-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration\nBeginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure.\nIn recent years, we expanded these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing networks, including closing our manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, as well as our information technology infrastructure.\nOn March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continue to implement this program. In addition, we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate Snyder's-Lance.\nCost estimates, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.\nA summary of pre-tax charges recorded in Earnings from continuing operations related to these initiatives is as follows:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Recognized as of August 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expenses </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing and selling expenses </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>641 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate after-tax impact </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per share impact </td> <td>$ </td> <td>.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations is as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Recognized as of August 2, 2020(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Includes $19 million of severance pay and benefits and $4 million of implementation costs and other related costs.\nAs of April 28, 2019, we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations. All of the costs were cash expenditures.\nA summary of the pre-tax costs in Earnings from continuing operations associated with the initiatives is as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>Recognized as of\nAugust 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance pay and benefits\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Implementation costs and other related costs\n</td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>641 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total estimated pre-tax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified are approximately $665 million to $690 million. This estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed.\nWe expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $215 million to $220 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $70 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $380 million to $400 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 33%; Snacks - approximately 42%; and Corporate - approximately 25%.\nOf the aggregate $665 million to $690 million of pre-tax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date, we expect approximately $585 million to $610 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $420 million in capital expenditures through 2022, of which we invested $336 million as of August 2, 2020. The capital expenditures primarily relate to the U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder's-Lance manufacturing network, implementation of an SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants, insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products, and optimization of the Snyder's-Lance warehouse and distribution network.\nWe expect to incur substantially all of the costs for the actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date through 2021 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.\nWe expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $800 million to $810 million in 2021, and once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $850 million by the end of 2022. The annual pre-tax savings associated with continuing operations generated were as follows:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax savings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pre-tax savings of over $90 million in 2019 and $60 million in 2018.\nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs in Earnings from continuing operations associated with segments is as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Costs Incurred to Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meals & Beverages </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Snacks </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>641 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. Proceeds were $55 million. On June 16, 2019, we sold our Bolthouse Farms business. Proceeds were $500 million. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Campbell Fresh reportable segment.\nWe completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019, for $322 million. We also completed the sale of the Arnott's and other international operations on December 23, 2019, for $2,286 million. The purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in $4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott's and other international operations, or Campbell International, as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Snacks reportable segment.\nResults of discontinued operations were as follows:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Campbell International </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Campbell Fresh </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) before taxes from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(359) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(721) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes on earnings (loss) from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(142) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of businesses / costs associated with selling the businesses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax expense (benefit) on sales / costs associated with selling the businesses </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(332) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(579) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2020, Campbell International sales and earnings from operations decreased reflecting the sales of the businesses.\nThe sale of the Arnott's and other international operations resulted in a substantial capital gain for tax purposes. We were able to utilize capital losses, which were offset with valuation allowances as of July 28, 2019, to offset the capital gain.\nIn 2019, Campbell International sales decreased reflecting the negative impact of currency translation and declines in Kelsen cookies in the U.S.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in Kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business.\nIn 2019, excluding items impacting comparability, earnings from Campbell International declined primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage, reflecting higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending, as well as the negative impact of currency translation.\nIn 2019, Campbell Fresh sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the businesses, as well as declines in refrigerated soup, Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and Garden Fresh Gourmet.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recorded impairment charges on the reporting units in Campbell Fresh. See \"Significant Accounting Estimates\" for additional information. In 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $360 million ($275 million after tax, or $.91 per share). In 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges were $694 million ($571 million after tax, or $1.89 per share). In 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses, including transaction costs. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million in the third quarter as deferred tax assets associated with Bolthouse Farms were not realizable. In 2018, loss from operations included a benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $1,396 million in 2020, compared to $1,398 million in 2019. The decline in 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital, mostly offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments.\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $1,398 million in 2019, compared to $1,305 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to improvements in working capital management efforts and higher cash earnings.\nCurrent assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements. We had negative working capital of $690 million as of\nAugust 2, 2020, and $1,418 million as of July 28, 2019. Total debt maturing within one year was $1,202 million as of August 2, 2020, and $1,603 million as of July 28, 2019.\nCapital expenditures were $299 million in 2020, $384 million in 2019 and $407 million in 2018. Capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than 2019 reflecting delays in certain projects impacted by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2021. Capital expenditures in 2020 included the implementation of an SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, a Milano cookie capacity expansion project, chip capacity expansion projects, and a Goldfish cracker capacity expansion project. Capital expenditures in 2019 included a U.S. warehouse optimization project, replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants, a Snyder's-Lance regional distribution center, a Milano cookie capacity expansion project, and a Goldfish cracker capacity expansion project. Capital expenditures in 2018 included a U.S. warehouse optimization project; transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants; insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products; replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system; and an Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity expansion project.\nPepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. In order to maintain and expand this model, we routinely purchase and sell routes. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities.\nPrimarily in response to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the ensuing uncertainty surrounding the operating environment and the commercial paper market, as well as favorable credit markets at the time, on April 24, 2020, we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2.375% per annum, due April 24, 2030, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% per annum, due April 24, 2050. On May 1, 2020, we used $300 million of the net proceeds to repay $300 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper as it comes due and for general corporate purposes, thereby lessening our reliance on commercial paper. The 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 and the 3.125% Senior Notes due 2050 may each be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, in whole or in part, at our option at any time and from time to time prior to January 24, 2030, and October 24, 2049, respectively. Interest on each of the notes is due semi-annually on April 24 and October 24, commencing on October 24, 2020. The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date.\nOn February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. Proceeds were $55 million. On June 16, 2019, we sold our Bolthouse Farms business. Proceeds were $500 million.\nWe completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019, for $322 million. On September 30, 2019, we repaid $399 million of our senior unsecured term loan facility using net proceeds from the Kelsen sale and the issuance of commercial paper. In addition, on October 11, 2019, we completed the sale of our European chips business for \u00a363 million, or $77 million.\nWe completed the sale of the Arnott's and other international operations on December 23, 2019, for $2,286 million. The purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in $4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020. We used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce our debt through a series of actions. On December 31, 2019, we repaid the $100 million outstanding balance on our senior unsecured term loan facility. On January 22, 2020, we completed the redemption of all $500 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Senior Notes due 2021, which were issued in connection with our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. On January 24, 2020, we settled tender offers to purchase $1,200 million in aggregate principal amount of certain unsecured debt, comprising $329 million of 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021, $634 million of 3.65% Senior Notes due 2023, and $237 million of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2043. Except for the $237 million of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2043, the Senior Notes settled under the tender offer were issued in connection with our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. The consideration for the redemption and the tender offers was $1,765 million, including $65 million of premium. We recognized a loss of $75 million (including $65 million of premium, fees and other costs paid with the tender offers and unamortized debt issuance costs), which was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the purchased notes through the dates of settlement. The net divestiture proceeds remaining after these debt reduction activities were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Total consideration was $6,112 million, which included the payoff of approximately $1,100 million of Snyder's-Lance indebtedness. We borrowed $900 million under a single draw 3-year senior unsecured term loan facility on March 26, 2018, and issued $5,300 million in the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes on March 16, 2018, to finance the acquisition. The senior unsecured term loan facility contained customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type and a maximum leverage ratio covenant. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $401 million of the facility. As a result of such prepayment, the maximum leverage ratio covenant\nin the senior unsecured term loan facility no longer applied. We repaid the remaining balance of the facility in 2020 in connection with the divestitures as disclosed above. The $5,300 million in the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes were issued in various tenors in both fixed and floating rate formats. We issued 2 and 3-year floating rate Senior notes in the amount of $500 million and $400 million, respectively. We issued 3, 5, 7, 10, and 30-year fixed rate Senior Notes in the amount of $650 million, $1,200 million, $850 million, $1,000 million, and $700 million, respectively. The fixed rate Senior Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If change of control triggering events occur, we will be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. As described above, in 2020, a portion of the Senior Notes were included in the redemption and tender offers using the divestiture proceeds.\nOn October 30, 2018, we purchased the remaining ownership interest in Yellow Chips Holdings B.V., and began consolidating the business. The purchase price was $18 million.\nOn December 12, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Foods. The purchase price was $688 million and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\nIn September 2018, we repaid a portion of our AUD notes outstanding and refinanced the remainder with a new AUD $400 million, or $296 million, single-draw syndicated facility that matured on September 11, 2019. As of July 28, 2019, the balance outstanding under this facility was AUD $335 million, or $232 million. The syndicated facility was repaid in August 2019 and was terminated. The repayment was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\nDividend payments were $426 million in 2020, $423 million in 2019 and $426 million in 2018. Annual dividends declared were $1.40 per share in 2020, 2019, and 2018. The 2020 fourth quarter dividend was $.35 per share.\nWe repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $86 million in 2018. As a result of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, we suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs of August 2, 2020, we had $1,202 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $280 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of August 2, 2020, we issued $34 million of standby letters of credit. We have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1,850 million that matures in December 2021. This U.S. facility remained unused at August 2, 2020, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. In March 2020, we borrowed $300 million under this revolving credit facility and on May 1, 2020 we repaid the borrowings. The U.S. facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.\nWe are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of August 2, 2020. For additional information on debt, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long-term liabilities, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Contractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024-2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,863 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>2,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative payments(3)\n</td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(4)\n</td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>1,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term payments(5)\n</td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term cash obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Excludes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs.

The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $246 million. We guarantee approximately 2,500 bank loans made to Snyder's-Lance independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $199 million. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.\nINFLATION\nWe are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold. We use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives.\nMARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\nThe principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Net sales of continuing operations outside of the U.S. are concentrated principally in Canada and represent approximately 6% of 2020 net sales. Within discontinued operations, international sales were concentrated principally in Australia. We manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and borrowing in various foreign currencies. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.\nWe principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, soybean oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, cocoa, aluminum, soybean meal and corn.\nThe information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August 2, 2020. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 14, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations.

As of July 28, 2019, the total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was $323 million, including $83 million associated with discontinued operations, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $3 million.\nWe enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of August 2, 2020, the notional value of these contracts was $137 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $2 million. As of July 28, 2019, the notional value of these contracts was $183 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $3 million.\nWe enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index Institutional Plus Shares, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either: the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index Institutional Plus Shares; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $6 million at August 2, 2020, and $7 million at July 28, 2019. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in June 2021, was 0.93% at August 2, 2020. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was $13 million at August 2, 2020, and $17 million at July 28, 2019. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2021, was 0.53% at August 2, 2020. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $3 million at August 2, 2020, and $7 million at July 28, 2019. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2021, was 0.63% at August 2, 2020. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4 million as of August 2, 2020, and a gain of $1 million as of July 28, 2019.\nOur utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:\nTrade and consumer promotion programs - We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. We adopted revised guidance on the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2019. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nValuation of long-lived assets - Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow\nanalyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.\n2018 Assessments\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. The business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols, which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs. This cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short- and long-term margin expectations for this business. Based on this performance, we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. The fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value, which was $48 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business. During the third quarter of 2018, certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers, which represented a majority of the business, informed us of their intention to in-source production beginning in 2019, and the sales and operating profit outlook of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business was reduced. Due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers, as well as the performance of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business, we revised the long-term outlook for future sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit, which resulted in an $81 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, $13 million on a trademark, and $11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit.\nIn addition, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations. We assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remained with the unit. This revised outlook resulted in a $384 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, and $130 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.\nContinuing Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $54 million on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales.\n2019 Assessments\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn August 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the Campbell Fresh operating segment. As we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value, in the second quarter of 2019, we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within Campbell Fresh, which included Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms carrot and\ncarrot ingredients, and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. As a result, we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses.\nWithin Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients, we recorded impairment charges of $18 million on the trademark, and $159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets. Within Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, we recorded impairment charges of $74 million on the trademark, and $31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets. On Garden Fresh Gourmet, we recorded impairment charges of $23 million on the trademark and $39 million on customer relationships, which eliminated the carrying value of these assets, and $2 million on plant assets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in Kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business. On July 12, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business. We sold the business on September 23, 2019.\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.\nContinuing Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed an assessment on the assets within our European chips business and recorded an impairment charge of $16 million on intangible assets. This business was included in the Snacks segment and reporting unit.\n2020 Assessments\nContinuing Operations\nAs of August 2, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill was $3,986 million. Based on our assessments, all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the carrying value.\nAs of August 2, 2020, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $2,611 million, including $1,978 million associated with Snyder's-Lance. Of the carrying value of all indefinite-lived trademarks, $620 million related to the Snyder's of Hanover trademark, $292 million related to the Pace trademark, $280 million related to the Pacific Foods trademark and $61 million related to the Plum trademark. Holding all other assumptions constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Various Snyder's-Lance </td> <td> </td> <td>Pace </td> <td> </td> <td>Pacific Foods </td> <td> </td> <td>Plum </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% reduction in revenue growth </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.\nIf assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential additional impairment charges could result. We will continue to monitor the valuation of our long-lived assets.\nSee also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.\nPension and postretirement benefits - We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense.\nThe discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. Beginning in 2018, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense (income). We elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations. We accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in\naccounting estimate. As a result of this change, net periodic benefit income increased by approximately $17 million in 2018, compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method.\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.\nNet periodic pension and postretirement expense (income) was $93 million in 2020, $103 million in 2019 and ($185) million in 2018.\nSignificant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate for benefit obligations </td> <td>2.47% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.46% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.15% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>6.01% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.85% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate for obligations </td> <td>2.15% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.28% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.06% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial health care trend rate </td> <td>6.25% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.25% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.75% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate health care trend rate </td> <td>4.50% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $9 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $120 million. A 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss.\nContributions to pension plans were $2 million in 2020, and $5 million in 2019 and 2018. Contributions to pension plans are not expected to be material in 2021.\nSee also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.\nIncome taxes - The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings.\nSee also Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements.\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nThis Report contains \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" as well as the information contained in \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.\n2020 illustrated the importance of a focused strategic plan and a dynamic team as we faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year can be viewed in two clear and separate halves. The first half of 2020 was a period of steady execution against our strategic roadmap. We began the year focused on strengthening our brand powerhouse, with two distinct divisions concentrated in North America: Meals & Beverages and Snacks; each home to strong portfolios of products. We kicked off our Win in Soup\u201d strategic plan and completed our planned divestitures of our Campbell International and European chips business, using the proceeds to reduce our leverage while implementing a new operating model to optimize growth and profitability. The groundwork we established in the first half of 2020 served as a springboard for the business into the second half of the year, when progress against our strategy accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America during the second half of 2020, we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our Meals & Beverages and Snacks segments, especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets. This result was attributable to a change in retail demand, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption, which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period. We also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products, especially in our soup business. The higher sales trends of our retail products may lessen or reverse in 2021 if customers or consumers alter their purchasing habits.\nIn response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. During the second half of 2020, we also experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nOverall, we benefited from increased product demand and favorable product mix as we leveraged our supply chain assets to respond to the impact of the pandemic. Consequently, our full-year results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for net sales and earnings from continuing operations.\nIn 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, our Garden Fresh Gourmet business and our Bolthouse Farms business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Campbell Fresh reportable segment. A portion of the U.S. refrigerated soup business historically included in Campbell Fresh was retained and is now reported in Meals & Beverages.\nAs discussed above, we completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019. On December 23, 2019, we completed the sale of our Arnott's business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in Australia and Asia Pacific (the Arnott's and other international operations). Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott's and other international operations (collectively referred to as Campbell International) as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Snacks reportable segment. In addition, on October 11, 2019, we completed the sale of our European chips business. The results of the European chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the Snacks reportable segment. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these divestitures and reportable segments.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2019, our retail business in Latin America was managed as part of the Meals & Beverages segment. Beginning in 2020, our business in Latin America is managed as part of the Snacks segment. Segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to deliver profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Real food that matters for life's moments. Our strategic plan is based on four pillars: create a profitable growth model; fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings; build a winning team and culture; and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below.\nWe plan to continue to build upon our consumer and customer engagement models, which we believe will enhance our profitable growth model. We plan to do this through the development of more consumer-oriented product quality, marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles. In addition, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of our snacks business while also investing in U.S. soup and our other core brands.\nWe also expect to continue pursuing our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). We expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization, organization consolidation and integration, procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories. See \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information on these initiatives.\nWe also plan to focus on building a winning team and culture by improving our employee experience, advancing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities that support our core brands in North America. In addition, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives, progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a competitive and dynamic retail environment; and cost inflation.\nOur strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. We also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods as well as plant-based foods.\nRetailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products. Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which prior to the pandemic, had experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade. Although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future, we anticipate that the growth of e-commerce, including omnichannel click and collect models, as well as alternative retail channels, such as club and dollar stores, to continue.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in increased demand for our retail products, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption. In response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. The continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting government stay-at-home orders in the United States in 2021 may continue to drive consumer demand for our products, which may be in excess of our ability to supply. In mitigating supply chain risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nThe cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs. Despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future with any certainty, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021.\nSummary of Results\nThis Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.\nThere were 53 weeks in 2020. There were 52 weeks in 2019 and 2018.\n\u2022Net sales increased 7% in 2020 to $8,691 million, primarily due to gains in Meals & Beverages and Snacks. The 53rd week contributed 2 points of growth, which was mostly offset by the impact of the divestiture of the European chips business. As a result of COVID-19, net sales accelerated in our retail products in the second half of 2020 with increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption, partly offset by declines in foodservice as a result of shifts in consumer behavior and continued COVID-19 restrictions.\n\u2022Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 34.5% in 2020 from 33.2% a year ago. The increase was primarily due to supply chain productivity improvements, cost savings initiatives, favorable product mix and operating leverage, partly offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including the impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022Interest expense decreased to $345 million in 2020 from $356 million a year ago. The current year included a loss of $75 million related to extinguishment of debt. After adjusting for this item, interest expense declined primarily due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio.\n\u2022Earnings from continuing operations per share were $1.95 in 2020, compared to $1.57 a year ago.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information.\nThe items impacting comparability are summarized below:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" as well as the information contained in \"Risk Factors.\"\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.\n2020 illustrated the importance of a focused strategic plan and a dynamic team as we faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year can be viewed in two clear and separate halves. The first half of 2020 was a period of steady execution against our strategic roadmap. We began the year focused on strengthening our brand powerhouse, with two distinct divisions concentrated in North America: Meals & Beverages and Snacks; each home to strong portfolios of products. We kicked off our Win in Soup\u201d strategic plan and completed our planned divestitures of our Campbell International and European chips business, using the proceeds to reduce our leverage while implementing a new operating model to optimize growth and profitability. The groundwork we established in the first half of 2020 served as a springboard for the business into the second half of the year, when progress against our strategy accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America during the second half of 2020, we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our Meals & Beverages and Snacks segments, especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets. This result was attributable to a change in retail demand, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption, which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period. We also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products, especially in our soup business. The higher sales trends of our retail products may lessen or reverse in 2021 if customers or consumers alter their purchasing habits.\nIn response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. During the second half of 2020, we also experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nOverall, we benefited from increased product demand and favorable product mix as we leveraged our supply chain assets to respond to the impact of the pandemic. Consequently, our full-year results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for net sales and earnings from continuing operations.\nIn 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, our Garden Fresh Gourmet business and our Bolthouse Farms business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Campbell Fresh reportable segment. A portion of the U.S. refrigerated soup business historically included in Campbell Fresh was retained and is now reported in Meals & Beverages.\nAs discussed above, we completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019. On December 23, 2019, we completed the sale of our Arnott's business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in Australia and Asia Pacific (the Arnott's and other international operations). Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott's and other international operations (collectively referred to as Campbell International) as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Snacks reportable segment. In addition, on October 11, 2019, we completed the sale of our European chips business. The results of the European chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the Snacks reportable segment. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these divestitures and reportable segments.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2019, our retail business in Latin America was managed as part of the Meals & Beverages segment. Beginning in 2020, our business in Latin America is managed as part of the Snacks segment. Segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to deliver profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Real food that matters for life's moments. Our strategic plan is based on four pillars: create a profitable growth model; fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings; build a winning team and culture; and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below.\nWe plan to continue to build upon our consumer and customer engagement models, which we believe will enhance our profitable growth model. We plan to do this through the development of more consumer-oriented product quality, marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles. In addition, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of our snacks business while also investing in U.S. soup and our other core brands.\nWe also expect to continue pursuing our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). We expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization, organization consolidation and integration, procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories. See \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information on these initiatives.\nWe also plan to focus on building a winning team and culture by improving our employee experience, advancing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities that support our core brands in North America. In addition, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives, progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a competitive and dynamic retail environment; and cost inflation.\nOur strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. We also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods as well as plant-based foods.\nRetailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products. Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which prior to the pandemic, had experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade. Although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future, we anticipate that the growth of e-commerce, including omnichannel click and collect models, as well as alternative retail channels, such as club and dollar stores, to continue.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in increased demand for our retail products, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption. In response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. The continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting government stay-at-home orders in the United States in 2021 may continue to drive consumer demand for our products, which may be in excess of our ability to supply. In mitigating supply chain risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.\nThe cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs. Despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future with any certainty, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021.\nSummary of Results\nThis Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.\nThere were 53 weeks in 2020. There were 52 weeks in 2019 and 2018.\n\u2022Net sales increased 7% in 2020 to $8,691 million, primarily due to gains in Meals & Beverages and Snacks. The 53rd week contributed 2 points of growth, which was mostly offset by the impact of the divestiture of the European chips business. As a result of COVID-19, net sales accelerated in our retail products in the second half of 2020 with increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption, partly offset by declines in foodservice as a result of shifts in consumer behavior and continued COVID-19 restrictions.\n\u2022Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 34.5% in 2020 from 33.2% a year ago. The increase was primarily due to supply chain productivity improvements, cost savings initiatives, favorable product mix and operating leverage, partly offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including the impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022Interest expense decreased to $345 million in 2020 from $356 million a year ago. The current year included a loss of $75 million related to extinguishment of debt. After adjusting for this item, interest expense declined primarily due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio.\n\u2022Earnings from continuing operations per share were $1.95 in 2020, compared to $1.57 a year ago. The current and prior year included expenses of $1.01 and $.74 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.\n\u2022Earnings from discontinued operations per share were $3.41 in the 2020, compared to a Loss per share of $.87 a year ago. The current year included gains of $3.29 and the prior year included expenses of $1.18 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.\nNet Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2020 Compared with 2019\nThe following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:\nContinuing Operations\n\u2022In 2020, we recognized losses of $121 million in Other expenses / (income) ($92 million after tax, $.30 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.

In 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of Campbell Fresh, including transaction costs. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million as deferred tax assets on Bolthouse Farms were not realizable. The aggregate impact was $51 million after tax, or $.17 per share.

operations were $592 million ($1.95 per share) in 2020, compared to $474 million ($1.57 per share) in 2019. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased reflecting sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, an improved gross profit performance and lower interest expense, partially offset by increased marketing investment. The additional week contributed approximately $.04 per share to Earnings from continuing operations in 2020.\nSee \"Discontinued Operations\" for additional information.\nNet Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2019 Compared with 2018\nIn addition to the 2019 items that impacted comparability of Net earnings discussed above, the following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:\nContinuing Operations\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized gains of $131 million in Other expenses / (income) ($100 million after tax, or $.33 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $42 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $87 million in Administrative expenses, $45 million in Cost of products sold, and $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $132 million after tax, or $.44 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above.

The net impact was a tax benefit of $126 million ($.42 per share). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Taxes on Earnings\" for additional information;\n\u2022In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed an impairment assessment on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after tax, or $.14 per share) in Other expenses / (income). See \"Significant Accounting Estimates\" for additional information;\n\u2022In the second quarter of 2018, we announced our intent to acquire Snyder's-Lance and on March 26, 2018, the acquisition closed. In 2018, we incurred $120 million of transaction and integration costs, of which $13 million was recorded in Restructuring charges, $12 million in Administrative expenses, $53 million in Other expenses / (income), and $42 million in Cost of products sold associated with an acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. We also recorded a gain in Interest expense of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the acquisition. The aggregate impact was $102 million, $73 million after tax, or $.24 per share; and\n\u2022In 2018, we recorded expense of $22 million in Other expenses / (income) ($15 million after tax, or $.05 per share) from a settlement of a legal claim.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\u2022In 2018, we recognized gains of $5 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments for defined benefit pension plans;\n\u2022In the third quarter of 2018, we performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, we revised our long-term outlook due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with certain private label customers, as well as the performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was below expectations. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11 million on the tangible assets and $94 million on the intangible assets ($80 million after tax, or $.27 per share) of the deli reporting unit, and a non-cash impairment charge of $514 million ($417 million after tax, or $1.39 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $619 million ($497 million after tax, or $1.65 per share).\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations.
