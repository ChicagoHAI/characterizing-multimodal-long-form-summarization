Our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the Brink's\u201d brand, so we seek to protect and build its value. Because our services focus on handling, transporting, protecting and managing valuables, we strive to understand and manage risk.\nIn order to earn an adequate return on capital, we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources in addition to our pricing discipline. We attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches, vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety, security or service.\nOperating results may vary from period to period. Because revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported, they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers. We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis. The purpose of the non-GAAP information is to report our operating profit, income from continuing operations and earnings per share without certain income and expense items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations and to reflect a constant tax rate for quarterly results equal to the full-year non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide information to assist comparability and estimates of future performance. The non-GAAP adjustments used to reconcile our GAAP results are described in detail on page 36.\nDefinition of Organic Growth Organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period, excluding the effect of: acquisitions and dispositions, changes in currency exchange rates (as described on page 22) and the accounting effects of reporting Venezuela under highly inflationary accounting.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,061.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>2,424.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,471.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>431.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,908.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,976.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating profit\n</td> <td>206.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>113.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 36-37.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in EMEA ($9.4 million) and France ($5.6 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), Latin America ($92.1 million), Brazil ($28.9 million), the U.S. ($22.2 million) and Mexico ($15.6 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 13% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation). See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 2% to $2,424.8 million as changes in currency rates more than offset higher labor costs from inflation-based increases. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 7% to $431.5 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $87.6 million due mainly to:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $35.3 million charge in 2015 related to impairment of fixed assets in Venezuela, which did not reoccur in 2016,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an organic increase in Venezuela ($82.5 million), Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),\n</td> </tr>\n</table> partially offset by:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($73.3 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016 ($15.0 million),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>negative impact of exiting operations in Ireland ($10.5 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 improved $45.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($26.6 million) and higher income tax expense ($12.0 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.72, up from negative $0.19 in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $68.5 million or 2% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($198.1 million), the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), and an organic decrease in EMEA ($9.4 million) and France ($5.6 million), partially offset by organic growth in Latin America ($92.1 million), Brazil ($28.9 million), the U.S. ($22.2 million) and Mexico ($15.6 million). The reduction in non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and most currencies in Latin America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Latin America (including the effects of inflation). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $49.7 million in 2016 due mainly to:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an organic increase in Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),\n</td> </tr>\n</table> partially offset by:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($22.4 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $28.9 million to $113.1 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($16.8 million).

A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in February 2015. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the euro, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 11% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation, which results in pricing adjustments in certain countries).

The reduction in non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Brazilian real and Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America.

devaluations ($4.8 million in 2016, $18.1 million in 2015 and $121.6 million in 2014) and charges related to the impairment of property and equipment ($35.3 million in 2015), due to management's inability to allocate, generate or redeploy resources in-country or globally. In light of these unique circumstances, our operations in Venezuela are largely independent of the rest of our global operations. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer, the Company's Chief Operating Decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses segment performance and makes resource decisions by segment excluding Venezuela operating results. Additionally, management believes excluding Venezuela from segment results makes it possible to more effectively evaluate the company's performance between periods.\nFactors considered by management in excluding Venezuela results include:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued inability to repatriate cash to redeploy to other operations or dividend to shareholders\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Highly inflationary environment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fixed exchange rate policy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued currency devaluations and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Difficulty raising prices and controlling costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReorganization and Restructuring\n2016 Restructuring\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions. As a result of these actions, we recognized asset-related adjustments of $16.3 million, severance costs of $7.2 million, lease restructuring charges of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $6.1 million benefit related to the termination of a benefit program. Severance actions are expected to reduce our global workforce by 700 to 800 positions. We expect that the 2016 restructuring will result in $8 to $12 million in 2017 cost savings.\nExecutive Leadership and Board of Directors\nIn 2015, we recognized $1.8 million in charges related to Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions, which were announced in January 2016. We recognized $4.3 million in charges in 2016 related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions.\n2015 Restructuring\nBrink's initiated an additional restructuring of its business in the third quarter of 2015. We recognized $11.6 million in 2015 costs related to employee severance, contract terminations, and lease terminations associated with the 2015 restructuring, which reduced the global workforce by approximately 1,100 positions and resulted in approximately $20 million in 2016 cost savings. We recognized charges of $6.5 million in 2016 related to this restructuring.\n2014 Restructuring\nBrink's reorganized and restructured its business in December 2014, eliminating the management roles and structures in its former Latin America and EMEA regions and implementing a plan to reduce the cost structure of various country operations by eliminating approximately 1,700 positions across its global workforce. Severance costs of $21.8 million associated with these actions were recognized in 2014. An additional $1.9 million in costs were recognized in 2015 related to the 2014 restructuring. The restructuring saved annual direct costs of approximately $50 million in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding charges for severance, lease termination and accelerated depreciation.\nDue to the unique circumstances around these charges, they have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non-GAAP results. Charges related to the employees, assets, leases and contracts impacted by these restructuring actions were excluded from the segments and corporate expenses as shown in the table below.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reportable Segments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest 5 Markets\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Markets\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Services\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total reportable segments\n</td> <td>(23.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate items\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetirement plans\nU.S. Plans\nBecause our U.S. retirement plans are frozen, costs related to these plans have not been allocated to segment results. Brink's primary U.S. pension plan settled a portion of its obligation in the fourth quarter of 2014 under a lump sum buy-out offer. Approximately 4,300 terminated participants were paid about $150 million of plan assets under this offer in lieu of receiving their pension benefit. A $56 million settlement loss was recognized as a result of the settlement.\nNon-U.S. Plans\nWe have operations outside of the U.S. with employee benefits that are accounted for as retirement benefits under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Whenever settlement charges related to these retirement benefits occur, they are not allocated to segment results. We recognized settlement charges in Mexico ($2.2 million in 2016, $4.6 million in 2015 and $5.9 million in 2014) and Switzerland ($0.3 million in 2016).\nAcquisitions and dispositions Certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non-GAAP results. These items are described below:\n2016 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Due to management's decision in the first quarter of 2016 to exit the Republic of Ireland, the prospective impacts of shutting down this operation are included in items not allocated to segments and are excluded from the operating segments effective March 1, 2016. This activity is also excluded from the consolidated non-GAAP results. Beginning May 1, 2016, due to management's decision to also exit Northern Ireland, the results of shutting down these operations are treated similarly to the Republic of Ireland. 2015 revenues from both Ireland operations were approximately $20 million. Charges included in our GAAP results include $4.9 million in severance costs, $1.8 million in property impairment charges, lease restructuring charges of $0.5 million and an additional $7.0 million in operating and other exit costs. These costs have been excluded from our segment and our consolidated non-GAAP results.

The accounting adjustments revised the accounting for certain share-based awards from fixed to variable fair value accounting. As of July 11, 2014, all outstanding equity awards had met the conditions for a grant date as defined in ASC Topic 718 and have since been accounted for as fixed share-based compensation expense.\n2016 versus 2015\nThe impact of other items not allocated to segments on operating profit was a smaller loss ($62.3 million in 2016 versus $100.2 million in the prior year period). The reduction was primarily due to the $35.3 million of Venezuela impairment charges recognized in the prior year period as well as lower losses related to currency devaluation in Venezuela in the current year period. The Venezuela-related items were partially offset by charges related to the shutdown of operations in Ireland, a loss on the sale of corporate assets and higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016.\n2015 versus 2014\nOther items not allocated to segments was a lower expense in 2015 versus the prior year period primarily due to lower devaluation charges in Venezuela, a decrease in U.S. retirement plans expense and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by the $44.3 million gain on the 2014 sale of our former equity method investment in Peru in 2014, the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges of $35.3 million and lower profits from Venezuela operations.\nOther Operating Income and Expense\nAmounts below represent consolidated other operating income and expense.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(127.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency derivative instrument gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on sale of property and equity investment\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Argentina conversion losses\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share in earnings (losses) of equity affiliates\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty income\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on business acquisitions and dispositions\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income (expense)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 versus 2015\nOther operating expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower losses from foreign currency items, property impairments, Argentina currency conversions and business dispositions. The reduction in foreign currency transaction losses mainly resulted from lower remeasurement losses associated with Venezuelan currency devaluation ($4.8 million in 2016 versus $18.1 million in 2015). Impairment charges declined in 2016 as the 2015 Venezuela property impairment of $35.3 million exceeded current year impairment losses, primarily from 2016 restructuring actions. After the December 2015 devaluation of the Argentine peso, we did not incur significant losses from converting Argentina pesos to U.S. dollars ($0.1 million in 2016 versus $7.1 million in 2015). In 2015, we recognized a $5.9 million loss on the sale of a Russian cash management business.\n2015 versus 2014\nOther operating expense decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of lower remeasurement losses associated with the currency devaluation in Venezuela ($18.1 million) versus the remeasurement charges related to the currency devaluation in the prior year ($121.6 million). The lower remeasurement charges in 2015 were partially offset by a 2014 gain on the sale of a Peru CIT business ($44.3 million), the 2015 Venezuela property impairment charges ($35.3 million) and a $5.9 million loss on the sale of a Russian cash management business, of which $5.0 million represented foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.

Changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances. Based on our historical and future expected taxable earnings, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.\nContinuing Operations\n2016 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2016 was greater than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the significant losses related to operations in the Republic of Ireland, for which no tax benefit can be recorded, a change in judgment resulting in a valuation allowance against certain U.S. tax attributes with a limited statutory carryforward period that are no longer more-likely-than-not to be realized, and the non-deductible expenses resulting from the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nExcluding those items, our effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2016 was 42%. This rate is higher than the 35% U.S. statutory rate primarily due to book losses for which no tax benefit can be recorded, non-deductible expenses in Mexico, taxes on undistributed earnings and the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax, partially offset by the geographical mix of earnings and a French income tax credit.\n2015 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2015 was higher than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a significant Venezuela currency remeasurement loss and impairment loss, which were largely non-deductible, and U.S. tax on accelerated taxable income. Excluding these items, the effective income tax rate was higher than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate due to $3.7 million of tax expense due to the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax.\n2014 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2014 was lower than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate (negative 75%) primarily due to a significant Venezuela currency remeasurement loss, which was largely non-deductible. Excluding the remeasurement loss, the effective income tax rate was higher than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate due to $9.9 million of tax expense from cross border payments and $4.4 million of tax expense due to the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax, mostly offset by a $4.6 million tax benefit due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings including the favorable Venezuela permanent inflation adjustment.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have not recorded U.S. federal deferred income taxes on approximately $229 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity affiliates in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We expect that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in operations outside the U.S. It is not practical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if all such income was remitted to the U.S. due to the inherent complexities associated with any hypothetical calculation, which would be dependent upon the exact form of repatriation.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change from a $16.3 million net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 to $10.3 million net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to improved results in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and lower currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency.\nThe net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 was primarily due to a $35.3 million impairment charge related to Venezuelan property and equipment and $18.1 million in currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency.\nThe net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2014 was primarily due to $121.6 million in currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the currency remeasurement charges of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and the Venezuela impairment charge that occurred in 2015.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations(a)(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sales\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to contingencies of former operations(c):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries related to BAX Global indemnification(d)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Discontinued operations include gains and losses related to businesses that we recently sold or shut down.

The purpose of the Non-GAAP results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. The specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments, are described in detail on pages 28-30, and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures below.\nThe full-year Non-GAAP tax rate in each year excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts. Amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented.\nThe Non-GAAP information is intended to provide information to assist analysts and investors with comparability and estimates of future performance. Brink's believes these measures are helpful in assessing operations and estimating future results and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance. In addition, Brink's believes the measures will help analysts and investors assess the ongoing operations of both our consolidated business and individual segments. Management uses Non-GAAP results to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes this provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business. Additionally, Non-GAAP results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans. Non-GAAP results should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, income or earnings per share amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and should be read in conjunction with their GAAP counterparts.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pre-tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pre-tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective tax rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Income Tax Rate(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items not allocated to segments(b)\n</td> <td>62.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax valuation allowance(c)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. tax on accelerated U.S. income(d)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pre-tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective tax rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Income Tax Rate(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items not allocated to segments(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>From continuing operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>See Other Items Not Allocated To Segments\u201d on pages 28-30 for pre-tax amounts and details.

explanations.\nForeign Operations\nWe currently serve customers in more than 100 countries, including 40 countries where we operate subsidiaries.\nWe are subject to risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries, including labor and economic conditions, political instability, controls on repatriation of earnings and capital, nationalization, expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments. Changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The future effects, if any, of these risks are unknown.\nOur international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our reported dollar revenues and operating profit, which may continue in 2017. Our operations in Venezuela are subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Foreign Currency Translation on pages 56-57 for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements, and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies.\nChanges in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. From time to time, we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies, as discussed in", "summary": "The report discusses The Brink\u2019s Company's financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE BRINK'S COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\n\nOPERATIONS\nThe Brink's Company offers transportation and logistics management services for cash and valuables throughout the world. These services include:\n \u2022 Cash-in-Transit ( CIT\u201d) Services - armored vehicle transportation of valuables \n \u2022 ATM Services - replenishing and maintaining customers' automated teller machines; providing network infrastructure services \n \u2022 Global Services - secure international transportation of valuables \n \u2022 Cash Management Services \n \u25e6 Currency and coin counting and sorting; deposit preparation and reconciliations; other cash management services \n \u25e6 Safe and safe control device installation and servicing (including our patented CompuSafe\u00ae service) \n \u25e6 Check and cash processing services for banking customers ( Virtual Vault Services\u201d) \n \u25e6 Check imaging services for banking customers \n \u2022 Payment Services - bill payment and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers at any of our Brink's or Brink's - operated payment locations in Latin America and Brink's Money\u2122 general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and payroll cards in the U.S. \n \u2022 Commercial Security Systems Services - design and installation of security systems in designated markets in Europe \n \u2022 Guarding Services - protection of airports, offices, and certain other locations in Europe and Brazil with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and highly trained patrolling personnel \nWe have nine operating segments:\n \u2022 Each of the five countries within Largest 5 Markets (U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil and Canada) \n \u2022 Each of the three regions within Global Markets (Latin America, EMEA and Asia) \n \u2022 Payment Services \nWe believe that Brink's has significant competitive advantages including:\n \u2022 track record of refining our business portfolio to deliver shareholder value \n \u2022 medium-term growth drivers from high-value services \n \u2022 global footprint in a world with increasing security needs \n \u2022 brand name recognition \n \u2022 reputation for a high level of service and security \n \u2022 risk management and logistics expertise \n \u2022 value-based solutions expertise \n \u2022 proven operational excellence \n \u2022 high-quality insurance coverage and general financial strength \nWe focus our time and resources on service quality, protecting and strengthening our brand, and addressing our risks. Our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the Brink's\u201d brand, so we seek to protect and build its value. Because our services focus on handling, transporting, protecting and managing valuables, we strive to understand and manage risk.\nIn order to earn an adequate return on capital, we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources in addition to our pricing discipline. We attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches, vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety, security or service.\nOperating results may vary from period to period. Because revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported, they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers. We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis. The purpose of the non-GAAP information is to report our operating profit, income from continuing operations and earnings per share without certain income and expense items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations and to reflect a constant tax rate for quarterly results equal to the full-year non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide information to assist comparability and estimates of future performance. The non-GAAP adjustments used to reconcile our GAAP results are described in detail on page 36.\nDefinition of Organic Growth Organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period, excluding the effect of: acquisitions and dispositions, changes in currency exchange rates (as described on page 22) and the accounting effects of reporting Venezuela under highly inflationary accounting.\n\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 36-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in EMEA ($9.4 million) and France ($5.6 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), Latin America ($92.1 million), Brazil ($28.9 million), the U.S. ($22.2 million) and Mexico ($15.6 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 13% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation). See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 2% to $2,424.8 million as changes in currency rates more than offset higher labor costs from inflation-based increases. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 7% to $431.5 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $87.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 a $35.3 million charge in 2015 related to impairment of fixed assets in Venezuela, which did not reoccur in 2016, \n \u2022 an organic increase in Venezuela ($82.5 million), Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($73.3 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, \n \u2022 higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016 ($15.0 million), \n \u2022 negative impact of exiting operations in Ireland ($10.5 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million). \nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 improved $45.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($26.6 million) and higher income tax expense ($12.0 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.72, up from negative $0.19 in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $68.5 million or 2% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($198.1 million), the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), and an organic decrease in EMEA ($9.4 million) and France ($5.6 million), partially offset by organic growth in Latin America ($92.1 million), Brazil ($28.9 million), the U.S. ($22.2 million) and Mexico ($15.6 million). The reduction in non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and most currencies in Latin America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Latin America (including the effects of inflation). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $49.7 million in 2016 due mainly to:\n \u2022 an organic increase in Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($22.4 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $28.9 million to $113.1 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($16.8 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.24, up from $1.69 in 2015.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2016 versus 2015\n\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n (a) Includes operating results and gains/losses on acquisitions and dispositions of assets and of businesses.

Operating profit decreased $8.8 million to $6.3 million due to higher fleet and insurance costs.\nFrance Revenues decreased 2% ($7.0 million) due to volume and pricing pressure, the loss of an airport guarding contract, and unfavorable currency ($1.4 million). Operating profit increased 6% ($2.1 million) due to growth in cash management and a benefit recognized related to social charges.\nMexico Revenues decreased 11% ($37.7 million) due to unfavorable currency impact ($53.3 million), partially offset by a 5% organic increase ($15.6 million) from price and volume increases. Operating profit decreased ($3.8 million) due primarily to unfavorable currency ($3.7 million).\nBrazil Revenues increased 6% ($15.3 million) due to 11% organic growth ($28.9 million) driven by price increases, partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($13.6 million). Operating profit increased 26% ($6.3 million), driven by organic growth ($6.4 million) on a favorable tax ruling and productivity improvements.\nCanada Revenues decreased 2% ($3.5 million) primarily due to the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($5.6 million). Operating profit decreased 22% ($2.4 million) driven by inflationary cost increases and low organic revenue growth.\nGlobal Markets\nLatin America Revenues decreased 4% ($14.8 million) as the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($106.9 million) was partially offset by organic growth of 25% ($92.1 million) driven by inflation-based price increases in Argentina. Operating profit increased 18% ($13.6 million) due to higher organic results in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact ($31.5 million).\nEMEA Revenues decreased 13% ($57.3 million) due to the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), unfavorable currency ($10.8 million), and organic revenue decreases throughout the region ($9.4 million) on lower BGS volumes. Operating profit increased 12% ($4.4 million) due to the favorable impact of dispositions ($4.2 million) and slightly higher organic results ($1.1 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency ($0.9 million).\nAsia Revenues increased 6% ($10.1 million) due to mainly to organic growth in Hong Kong and Singapore. Operating profit increased 6% ($1.8 million) primarily due to revenue growth.\nPayment Services\nPayment Services Revenues increased 5% ($4.2 million) as negative currency ($5.0 million) was more than offset by 11% organic growth ($9.2 million). Operating profit increased $9.5 million, driven by revenue growth and lower marketing expenditures related to increasing cardholders in the U.S. Payments business.\nAnalysis of Results: 2015 versus 2014\nConsolidated Results\n\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 36-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2015 versus 2014\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $500.9 million or 14% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($891.3 million) and an organic decrease in EMEA ($38.0 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($296.8 million), Latin America ($58.4 million), Payment Services ($18.9 million), Asia ($18.3 million), Brazil ($17.7 million) and Mexico ($8.5 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in February 2015. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the euro, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 11% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation, which results in pricing adjustments in certain countries). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 16% to $2,471.6 million as higher labor costs from inflation-based wage increases were more than offset by changes in currency rates, including devaluation in Venezuela, lower U.S. retirement costs ($31.2 million) and cost cutting initiatives. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 17% to $463.8 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates, including devaluation in Venezuela, lower U.S. retirement costs ($15.3 million) and cost cutting initiatives.\nConsolidated Operating Profit (Loss) Operating profit improved from a loss of $27.5 million to a profit of $56.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 lower remeasurement loss of net monetary assets ($103.5 million) as a result of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency (a $121.6 million charge in 2014 compared to an $18.1 million charge in 2015), \n \u2022 lower retirement benefit cost ($46.5 million), \n \u2022 organic profit improvement in Latin America ($38.5 million), Venezuela ($36.0 million), Mexico ($19.1 million), and Asia ($6.0 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($39.4 million) on an organic basis due to lower security costs and other cost reductions.  The positive impact of these factors was partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable currency impact due to changes in exchange rates ($100.4 million), including devaluation in Venezuela, \n \u2022 a $44.3 million gain on sale of our minority interest in a CIT business in Peru in 2014, \n \u2022 impairment charges in Venezuela ($35.3 million), and \n \u2022 organic profit decreases in EMEA ($13.6 million) and the U.S. ($7.7 million). \nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Loss from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2015 improved $45.7 million to a loss of $9.1 million primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above and lower interest expense ($4.5 million), partially offset by higher income tax expense ($29.8 million) and a lower loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ($14.6 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.19, an improvement from negative $1.12 in 2014.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2015 versus 2014\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $373.6 million or 11% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($467.2 million) and an organic decrease in EMEA ($38.0 million), partially offset by organic growth in Latin America ($58.4 million), Payment Services ($18.9 million), Asia ($18.3 million), Brazil ($17.7 million) and Mexico ($8.5 million). The reduction in non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Brazilian real and Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 3% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Latin America (including the effects of inflation and related pricing adjustments). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $32.6 million in 2015 due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic profit improvement in Latin America ($38.5 million), Mexico ($19.1 million) and Asia ($6.0 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($39.4 million) on an organic basis due to lower security costs and other cost reductions.  The positive impact of these factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates ($50.4 million) and \n \u2022 organic profit decreases in EMEA ($13.6 million) and the U.S. ($7.7 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2015 increased $34.8 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above and lower interest expense ($4.4 million), partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP tax expense ($5.4 million).

Our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the Brink's\u201d brand, so we seek to protect and build its value. Because our services focus on handling, transporting, protecting and managing valuables, we strive to understand and manage risk.\nIn order to earn an adequate return on capital, we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources in addition to our pricing discipline. We attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches, vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety, security or service.\nOperating results may vary from period to period. Because revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported, they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers. We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis. The purpose of the non-GAAP information is to report our operating profit, income from continuing operations and earnings per share without certain income and expense items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations and to reflect a constant tax rate for quarterly results equal to the full-year non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide information to assist comparability and estimates of future performance. The non-GAAP adjustments used to reconcile our GAAP results are described in detail on page 36.\nDefinition of Organic Growth Organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period, excluding the effect of: acquisitions and dispositions, changes in currency exchange rates (as described on page 22) and the accounting effects of reporting Venezuela under highly inflationary accounting.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,061.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>2,424.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,471.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>431.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>144.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,908.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,976.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating profit\n</td> <td>206.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>113.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 36-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in EMEA ($9.4 million) and France ($5.6 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), Latin America ($92.1 million), Brazil ($28.9 million), the U.S. ($22.2 million) and Mexico ($15.6 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 13% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation). See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 2% to $2,424.8 million as changes in currency rates more than offset higher labor costs from inflation-based increases. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 7% to $431.5 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $87.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 a $35.3 million charge in 2015 related to impairment of fixed assets in Venezuela, which did not reoccur in 2016, \n \u2022 an organic increase in Venezuela ($82.5 million), Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($73.3 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, \n \u2022 higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016 ($15.0 million), \n \u2022 negative impact of exiting operations in Ireland ($10.5 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million). \nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 improved $45.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($26.6 million) and higher income tax expense ($12.0 million).

See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $49.7 million in 2016 due mainly to:\n \u2022 an organic increase in Latin America ($45.1 million), Payment Services ($9.1 million), and Brazil ($6.4 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($22.4 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in the U.S. ($8.8 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $28.9 million to $113.1 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($16.8 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.24, up from $1.69 in 2015.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2016 versus 2015\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions /\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dispositions(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>431.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>424.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>270.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>153.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest 5 Markets\n</td> <td>1,919.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,908.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>369.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>444.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>157.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Markets\n</td> <td>972.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>910.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Services\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues -

Operating profit decreased $8.8 million to $6.3 million due to higher fleet and insurance costs.\nFrance Revenues decreased 2% ($7.0 million) due to volume and pricing pressure, the loss of an airport guarding contract, and unfavorable currency ($1.4 million). Operating profit increased 6% ($2.1 million) due to growth in cash management and a benefit recognized related to social charges.\nMexico Revenues decreased 11% ($37.7 million) due to unfavorable currency impact ($53.3 million), partially offset by a 5% organic increase ($15.6 million) from price and volume increases. Operating profit decreased ($3.8 million) due primarily to unfavorable currency ($3.7 million).\nBrazil Revenues increased 6% ($15.3 million) due to 11% organic growth ($28.9 million) driven by price increases, partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($13.6 million). Operating profit increased 26% ($6.3 million), driven by organic growth ($6.4 million) on a favorable tax ruling and productivity improvements.\nCanada Revenues decreased 2% ($3.5 million) primarily due to the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($5.6 million). Operating profit decreased 22% ($2.4 million) driven by inflationary cost increases and low organic revenue growth.\nGlobal Markets\nLatin America Revenues decreased 4% ($14.8 million) as the negative impact of currency exchange rates ($106.9 million) was partially offset by organic growth of 25% ($92.1 million) driven by inflation-based price increases in Argentina. Operating profit increased 18% ($13.6 million) due to higher organic results in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact ($31.5 million).\nEMEA Revenues decreased 13% ($57.3 million) due to the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), unfavorable currency ($10.8 million), and organic revenue decreases throughout the region ($9.4 million) on lower BGS volumes. Operating profit increased 12% ($4.4 million) due to the favorable impact of dispositions ($4.2 million) and slightly higher organic results ($1.1 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency ($0.9 million).\nAsia Revenues increased 6% ($10.1 million) due to mainly to organic growth in Hong Kong and Singapore. Operating profit increased 6% ($1.8 million) primarily due to revenue growth.\nPayment Services\nPayment Services Revenues increased 5% ($4.2 million) as negative currency ($5.0 million) was more than offset by 11% organic growth ($9.2 million). Operating profit increased $9.5 million, driven by revenue growth and lower marketing expenditures related to increasing cardholders in the U.S. Payments business.\nAnalysis of Results: 2015 versus 2014\nConsolidated Results\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,061.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,562.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>2,471.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,948.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>463.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,976.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,350.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating profit\n</td> <td>156.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 36-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2015 versus 2014\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $500.9 million or 14% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($891.3 million) and an organic decrease in EMEA ($38.0 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($296.8 million), Latin America ($58.4 million), Payment Services ($18.9 million), Asia ($18.3 million), Brazil ($17.7 million) and Mexico ($8.5 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in February 2015. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the euro, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America. Revenues increased 11% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Latin America (including the effects of inflation, which results in pricing adjustments in certain countries). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 16% to $2,471.6 million as higher labor costs from inflation-based wage increases were more than offset by changes in currency rates, including devaluation in Venezuela, lower U.S. retirement costs ($31.2 million) and cost cutting initiatives. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 17% to $463.8 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates, including devaluation in Venezuela, lower U.S. retirement costs ($15.3 million) and cost cutting initiatives.\nConsolidated Operating Profit (Loss) Operating profit improved from a loss of $27.5 million to a profit of $56.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 lower remeasurement loss of net monetary assets ($103.5 million) as a result of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency (a $121.6 million charge in 2014 compared to an $18.1 million charge in 2015), \n \u2022 lower retirement benefit cost ($46.5 million), \n \u2022 organic profit improvement in Latin America ($38.5 million), Venezuela ($36.0 million), Mexico ($19.1 million), and Asia ($6.0 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($39.4 million) on an organic basis due to lower security costs and other cost reductions.  The positive impact of these factors was partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable currency impact due to changes in exchange rates ($100.4 million), including devaluation in Venezuela, \n \u2022 a $44.3 million gain on sale of our minority interest in a CIT business in Peru in 2014, \n \u2022 impairment charges in Venezuela ($35.3 million), and \n \u2022 organic profit decreases in EMEA ($13.6 million) and the U.S. ($7.7 million). \nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Loss from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2015 improved $45.7 million to a loss of $9.1 million primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above and lower interest expense ($4.5 million), partially offset by higher income tax expense ($29.8 million) and a lower loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ($14.6 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.19, an improvement from negative $1.12 in 2014.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2015 versus 2014\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $373.6 million or 11% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($467.2 million) and an organic decrease in EMEA ($38.0 million), partially offset by organic growth in Latin America ($58.4 million), Payment Services ($18.9 million), Asia ($18.3 million), Brazil ($17.7 million) and Mexico ($8.5 million). The reduction in non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Brazilian real and Mexican peso and most currencies in Latin America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 3% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Latin America (including the effects of inflation and related pricing adjustments). See page 20 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $32.6 million in 2015 due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic profit improvement in Latin America ($38.5 million), Mexico ($19.1 million) and Asia ($6.0 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($39.4 million) on an organic basis due to lower security costs and other cost reductions.  The positive impact of these factors were partially offset by:\n \u2022 the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates ($50.4 million) and \n \u2022 organic profit decreases in EMEA ($13.6 million) and the U.S. ($7.7 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2015 increased $34.8 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above and lower interest expense ($4.4 million), partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP tax expense ($5.4 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.69, an improvement from $1.01 in 2014.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2015 versus 2014\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions /\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dispositions(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>727.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>France\n</td> <td>517.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico\n</td> <td>388.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazil\n</td> <td>364.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(111.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>179.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153.7\n</td>"}
