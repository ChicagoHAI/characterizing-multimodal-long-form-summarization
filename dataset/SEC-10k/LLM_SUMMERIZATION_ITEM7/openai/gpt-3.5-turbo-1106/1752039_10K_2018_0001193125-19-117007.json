MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the Company's operating results and financial condition as well as the operating results and financial condition for PPIX, PCA, and PIPE than can be obtained from reading the Financial Statements alone. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Company and \u201cItem 15. Exhibits\u201d for the financial statements and the notes thereto of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information that involves risk and uncertainties. Please see \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d for more information.\nOverview of the Company\nPositive Physicians Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d) is a newly created Pennsylvania domiciled holding company formed to be the stock holding company for Positive Physicians Insurance Company (\u201cPositive Insurance Company\u201d) following the conversions of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE from reciprocal insurance exchanges to stock insurance companies. The Company had minimal assets and liabilities and had not engaged in any operations as of December 31, 2018.\nAs part of the conversions, on March 27, 2019, PPIX merged with and into PPIX Conversion Corp., PCA merged with and into PCA Conversion Corp., and PIPE merged with and into PIPE Conversion Corp. Accordingly, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE no longer exist. Immediately thereafter, PCA Conversion Corp. and PIPE Conversion Corp. merged with and into PPIX Conversion Corp., which then changed its name to Positive Physicians Insurance Company, and became our single insurance company subsidiary and successor to PPIX, PCA and PIPE. Upon completion of the offering, the shareholders' equity of Positive Insurance Company is approximately $69.7 million. This increased capitalization should permit Positive Insurance Company to (i) increase direct premium volume to the extent competitive conditions permit, (ii) increase net premium volume by decreasing reliance on reinsurance, and (iii) enhance investment income by increasing Positive Insurance Company's investment portfolio.\nOverview of PPIX\nPPIX was an unincorporated exchange organized on April 20, 2004 and was licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a reciprocal insurance exchange. PPIX provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence, claims made plus, and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders). On October 9, 2018, Positive Physicians Captive Insurance Company, a sponsored captive insurance company, was incorporated in the State of New Jersey and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPIX. PPCIC was licensed under the New Jersey Captive Insurance Act on October 16, 2018. PPCIC has one protected unincorporated cell, Keystone Captive Group (\u201cKeystone\u201d). Keystone is owned by an insured of Positive Insurance Company.\nPPIX marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies direct to physicians and through independent producers to doctors and allied healthcare professionals who practice in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Ohio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX had direct premiums written of $15.6 million, net premiums earned of $13.1 million, and net loss of $(63,000). At December 31, 2018, PPIX had total assets of $63.6 million and a surplus of $16.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PPIX had direct premiums written of $15.3 million, net premiums earned of $12.3 million, and net loss of $(21,000). At December 31, 2017, PPIX had total assets of $67.2 million and a surplus of $17.5 million.\nPPIX was managed by Specialty Insurance Services, LLC (\u201cSIS\u201d), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, pursuant to the terms of an Attorney-In-Fact Agreement between the exchange and SIS. Pursuant to the terms of the Attorney-in-Fact Agreement, as amended, SIS provided underwriting and administrative services to PPIX based on a percentage not to exceed 25.0% of gross written premiums, less return premiums. SIS, as the attorney-in-fact, had the power to direct the activities of PPIX that most significantly impact PPIX's economic performance. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of SIS on January 1, 2017.\nOverview of PCA\nProfessional Casualty Association was an unincorporated, reciprocal insurance association organized on April 16, 2003 and formed for the purpose of insuring its subscribers against loss due to the imposition of legal liability. PCA provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders). PCA was managed by Professional Third Party, LP (\u201cPTP\u201d) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diversus, pursuant to the terms of an Attorney-in-Fact Agreement between PCA and PTP.\nPCA marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers primarily to doctors and allied healthcare providers who practice in Pennsylvania. In November 2015, PCA was granted a license to write insurance in Michigan and began writing policies in Michigan in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA had direct premiums written of $6.3 million, net premiums earned of $7.1 million, and a net loss of $(4.5) million. At December 31, 2018, PCA had total assets of $36.0 million and a surplus of $9.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PCA had direct premiums written of $7.7 million, net premiums earned of $7.5 million, and net income of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2017, PCA had total assets of $39.6 million and a surplus of $13.9 million. The net loss for PCA in 2018 is attributed to more losses and loss adjustment expenses than originally recorded as well as a decrease in direct premiums written of $1.4 million due a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewal of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PCA's direct premiums written of $4.2 million in 2017 is attributed to loss of a major client, a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewals of policies, and limited new business growth.\nPTP was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PCA pursuant to the terms of an agreement between PTP and PCA. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PTP provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PCA and paid certain expenses on behalf of PCA in exchange for 25% of the gross written premium. PTP, as the attorney-in-fact of PCA, had the power to direct the activities of PCA that most significantly impact PCA's economic performance by acting as the attorney-in-fact of PCA. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PTP on June 4, 2014.\nOverview of PIPE\nPIPE was an unincorporated exchange organized on March 14, 2005, and was licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a reciprocal insurance exchange. PIPE provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders).\nPIPE marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers to doctors and allied healthcare professionals who practice primarily in Pennsylvania.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.4 million, net premiums earned of $3.4 million, and a net loss of $(0.8) million. At December 31, 2018, PIPE had total assets of $25.0 million and a surplus of $11.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.6 million, net premiums earned of $3.1 million, and a net loss of $(60,000). At December 31, 2017, PIPE had total assets of $26.6 million and a surplus of $12.3 million. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.2 million in 2018 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.6 million in 2017 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth.\nPIPE Management was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PIPE pursuant to the terms of an attorney-in-fact agreement between PIPE Management and PIPE. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PIPMC provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PIPE and paid certain expenses on behalf of PIPE for 25% of gross written premium. PIPE Management, as the attorney-in-fact of PIPE, had the power to direct the activities of PIPE that most significantly impact PIPE's economic performance. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PIPE Management on November 23, 2015. SIS, PTP, and PIPE Management merged into Diversus Management in connection with the conversions.\nMarketplace Conditions and Trends\nThe MPLI industry is affected by recurring industry cycles known as \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d markets. A soft cycle is characterized by intense competition resulting in lower pricing in order to compete for business. A hard market, generally considered a beneficial industry trend, is characterized by reduced competition that results in higher pricing. From approximately 2001 until approximately 2007, the Pennsylvania MPLI market experienced a hard market cycle. This resulted in the creation of several alternative MPLI providers, such as PPIX, PCA, and PIPE. The MPLI market began to experience a soft cycle around the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to the large rate increases taken over the previous six years. That soft cycle has continued and has been contributed to by the restructuring of the healthcare industry, partially as a result of the Affordable Care Act. This has resulted in significant price competition as the number of medical professionals practicing independent of hospitals or large professional groups began to decline. According to a study prepared by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d), MPLI direct premiums written have declined by 25.3% on a national basis from 2006 to 2017 and have declined by 15.9% in Pennsylvania and 32.0% in New Jersey during this same time period. This has resulted in lower direct premiums written and lower operating profits for many MPLI carriers.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nPositive Insurance Company derives its revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\nGross and net premiums written\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\nPremiums earned\nPremiums earned are the earned portion of net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on MPLI policies are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. The policies written by PPIX, PCA, and PIPE typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2018, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2018 and the other half would be earned in 2019.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and debt securities. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned and net realized gains and losses on invested assets. With the adoption of an accounting standard as of January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities are included in net investment income. Prior to 2018, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities were charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by Wilmington Trust and the investment committee, who have discretion to buy and sell securities in accordance with the investment policy approved by Positive Insurance Company's board of directors.\nOur expenses consist primarily of:\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims, including legal fees.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses and underwriting and administrative expenses. Policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes, and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Underwriting and administrative expenses consist of salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately, and payments to bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals, rating plans and experience data.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with GAAP, we utilize certain financial performance measures that are used in the property and casualty insurance industry and that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These financial performance measures are the expense ratio, losses and loss adjustment expense ratio, combined ratio, and the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus.\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written, and measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and loss adjustment expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss), net income (loss) and return on equity.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses ratio\nThe losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned. Positive Insurance Company measures the loss ratio on a policy year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. A policy year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior policy years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\nExpense ratio\nThe expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering the company's insurance business.\nCombined ratio\nThe combined ratio is the sum of the losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio and the expense ratio and measures overall underwriting profit. If the combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\nUnderwriting income (loss)\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in the respective statements of operations of PPIX, PCA and PIPE.\nNet income (loss) and return on average equity\nWe use net income (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net income (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. Each exchange evaluated these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that it believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (indemnity losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss adjustment expenses). The loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported and for the future development of case reserves.\nWhen a claim is reported to Diversus Management, its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment to the extent it can be determined or estimated. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, and injury severity, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is contested or settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to resolve, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information becomes available.\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain estimates of reserves for IBNR. These reserves include estimates for the future development of case reserves. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Diversus Management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. Diversus Management may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable. We project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by using the following actuarial methodologies:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Actual versus Expected Model - The Actual versus Expected Model utilizes the actuarial point ultimate loss and defense containment cost (\u201cDCC\u201d) estimates as of the prior reserve review which were adjusted based on the difference between actual and expected loss development during that prior reserve review and the current evaluation to arrive at an updated actuarial point ultimate loss and DCC estimate. The method is dependent on the loss development factors used to determine the expected losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method (Paid and Incurred) - The Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method is a blended method that explicitly takes into account both actual loss development to date and expected future loss emergence. This method is applied on both a paid loss development method and an incurred loss development method. This method uses the selected loss development patterns from the two loss development methods to calculate the expected percentage of loss unpaid (or unreported). The expected future loss component of the method is calculated by multiplying earned premium for the given exposure period by a selected a priori (i.e. deductive) loss ratio. The resulting dollars are then multiplied by the expected percentage of unpaid (or unreported) loss described above. This provides an estimate of future paid (or reported) losses that is then added to actual paid (or incurred) loss data to produce estimated ultimate loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Expected Loss Ratio Method - The Expected Loss Ratio Method utilizes some measure of anticipated losses and does not consider actual losses. An expected loss ratio, a ratio of anticipated losses relative to some measure of exposure, is applied to that measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year. This method provides stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposure measure changes. This is offset by a lack of responsiveness to actual loss experience.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Frequency/Severity Method - The Frequency/Severity Method estimates ultimate losses by estimating a frequency and a severity component. For each year, the actuary estimates ultimate claims costs and an ultimate average severity. The actuary then multiplies these two estimates together. The method is useful when the claim count development pattern is more stable than the loss development pattern.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Incurred Loss Development Method - The Incurred Loss Development Method utilizes historical incurred loss (the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves) patterns to estimate future losses. This method is often preferred over the paid method as it includes the additional information provided by the aggregation of individual case reserves. The resulting loss development factors (LDFs) tend to be lower and more stable than those of the paid development method. However, the incurred development method may be affected by changes in case reserving practices and any unusually large individual claims. The actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various LDF selections.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiversus Management estimates IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as of the financial statement date. Diversus Management then reduces the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by losses and loss adjustment expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for the MPLI business. Finally, Diversus Management considers other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation is affected by the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expense reserves may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\nOur actuary determined a range of reasonable reserve estimates shown in the tables below, which reflect the uncertainty inherent in the loss reserve process. This range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. We believe that the actuarially-determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates, however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The range was determined after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized. The actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on its knowledge and judgment. In making these judgments the actuary typically assumed, based on its experience, that the larger the reserve the less volatility. In addition, when selecting these low and high estimates, the actuary considered:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Historical industry development experience in MPLI;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Historical company development experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Changes in the exchange's internal claims processing policies and procedures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Trends and risks in claim costs, such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related range of anticipated losses. Because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions. The method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by the actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years.\nThe width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated. The ultimate frequency or severity of the claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures.\nSpecifically, the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims, and therefore, the ultimate amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The rate of increase in medical costs that underlie insured risks; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact of changes in laws or regulations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts less than originally estimated or a reduction in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts greater than originally estimated or an increase in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (unfavorable development).\nPPIX Actuarial Ranges\nAlthough the range of loss estimates is determined by the exchange's actuary, the selection of the ultimate loss is based on information unique to each policy year and the judgment and expertise of PPIX's management.\nThe following table provides case and IBNR reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of PPIX as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018 (unaudited)\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

losses and loss adjustment expenses was $34.6 million and $38.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2018, PPIX had favorable developments of $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The favorable development of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to settlement of known claims below the amount for which they have been previously reserved, as well as additional revisions to the exchange's estimate of its ultimate losses for the 2012 through 2015 accident years. The favorable development of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reductions of the ultimate losses for the 2010, 2011, and 2015 policy years which were offset by strengthening the ultimate loss reserves for the 2016 and 2017 policy years.\nAs discussed earlier, the estimation of PPIX's reserves is based on several actuarial methods, each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions. The judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method, or combination of methods, to use for a given policy year. The ranges presented above represent the expected variability around the actuarially determined central estimate.\nRecent Variabilities of the Liability for\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance Recoverables\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dollars in thousands (unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As originally estimated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As estimated at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cumulative redundancy (deficiency)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % redundancy (deficiency)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below summarizes the impact on PPIX's equity from changes in estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reserve Range for Unpaid\nLoss and LAE\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Loss and\nLAE Reserve </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change\nin Equity (1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Low End\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High End\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Net of tax\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses were recorded at the high end of the actuarially-determined range, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses would increase by $3.6 million.

million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PCA experienced unfavorable and favorable developments of $(6.1) million and $0.4 million, respectively. The favorable development of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on all claims-made policy years. The unfavorable development of $(6.1) million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reserve strengthening in the 2015 ($400,000) occurrence policy year, the 2016 ($500,000) tail policy year and the 2017 ($400,000) and 2014 through 2017 ($4,500,000) claims-made policy years. A majority of these changes in indications were related to PCA's new claims management team and a change in reserving philosophy of setting reserves at the expected value as soon as possible when the liability is acknowledged.\nAs discussed earlier, the estimation of PCA's reserves is based on several actuarial methods, each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions. The judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method, or combination of methods, to use for a given policy year.

$11.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PIPE had unfavorable and favorable developments of $(0.9) million and $0.3 million, respectively. The favorable development of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the 2013 and 2014 policy years. The unfavorable development of $(0.9) million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reserve strengthening in the 2015 ($1,000,000) occurrence policy year and the 2013 ($500,000) claims-made policy years. PIPE did realize positive reserve development for the 2010-2012 occurrence policy years of $800,000. A majority of these changes in indications were related to PIPE's new claims management team and a change in reserving philosophy of setting reserves at the expected value as soon as possible when the liability is acknowledged.\nAs discussed earlier, the estimation of PIPE's reserves is based on several actuarial methods, each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions. The judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method, or combination of methods, to use for a given policy year. The ranges presented above represent the expected variability around the actuarially determined central estimate.\nRecent Variabilities of the Liability for\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance Recoverables\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dollars in thousands (unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As originally estimated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As estimated at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,266 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cumulative redundancy (deficiency)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(933 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % redundancy (deficiency)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The table below summarizes the impact on PIPE's equity from changes in estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reserve Range for Unpaid\nLoss and LAE\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Loss and\nLAE Reserve </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change\nin Equity (1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Low End\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High End\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Net of tax\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses were recorded at the high end of the actuarially-determined range, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses would increase by $1.4 million. This increase in reserves would have the effect of increasing net loss and decrease equity as of December 31, 2018 by $1.1 million. If the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses were recorded at the low end of the actuarially-determined range, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2017 would be reduced by $0.5 million with corresponding increases in net income and equity of $0.4 million.\nIf the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves were to adversely develop to the high end of the range, approximately $1.4 million of anticipated future payments for the losses and loss adjustment expenses would be required to be paid, thereby affecting cash flows in future periods as the payments for losses are made.\nInvestments\nThe fixed maturity investments are classified as available-for-sale and equity securities of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE are carried at estimated fair value as determined by management based upon quoted market prices or a recognized pricing service at the reporting date for those or similar investments. Limited partnership investments are measured at fair value using net asset values of the partnerships as a practical expedient. Changes in unrealized investment gains or losses on fixed maturity available-for-sale investments, net of applicable income taxes, are reflected directly in equity as a component of comprehensive income (loss) and, accordingly, have no effect on net income (loss). Beginning with January 1, 2018, changes in unrealized investment gains or losses on equity investments are reflected in net investment income. For 2017, changes in unrealized investment gains or losses on previously classified available-for-sale securities, net of applicable income taxes, are reflected directly in equity as a component of comprehensive income (loss) and, accordingly, have no effect on net income (loss). Investment income is recognized when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets to determine fair value disclosures. Fixed maturity available-for-sale securities and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FASB ASC Topic 820 \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (\u201cASC Topic 820\u201d), establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Level 1: </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets in active markets </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Level 2: </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in nonactive markets (few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time, etc., inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset (interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, default rates, etc., and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Level 3: </td> <td> </td> <td>Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. </td> </tr>\n</table> Under ASC Topic 820, we base fair values of assets on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in FASB ASC Topic 820. Fair value measurements for assets where there exists limited or no observable market data and, therefore, are based primarily upon the exchange's or other third-party's estimates, are often calculated based on the characteristics of the asset, the economic and competitive environment and other such factors. Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective period end and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of the financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each period-end. Additionally, changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations.\nWe obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (\u201cpricing service\u201d), which generally uses quoted prices or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, non-binding broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, and prepayment speeds. Because we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.\nIn instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\nPPIX

translate, respectively, into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments. The fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments also may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of other investments, the liquidity of the instrument, and other general market conditions.\nPPIX evaluated each security and took into account the severity and duration of the impairment, the current rating on the bond, and the outlook for the issuer according to independent analysts. PPIX found that the declines in fair value are most likely attributable to increases in interest rates, and there is no evidence that the likelihood of not receiving all of the contractual cash flows as expected has changed. Our fixed maturity portfolio is managed by our investment committee in concert with an outside investment manager for investment grade bond investments. By agreement, the investment manager cannot sell any security without the consent of our investment committee if such sale will result in a net realized loss.\nWe monitor our investment portfolio and review securities that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary. When assessing whether the amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered, we compare the present value of the cash flows likely to be collected, based on an evaluation of all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, to the amortized cost basis of the security. The shortfall of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is referred to as the \u201ccredit loss.\u201d If there is a credit loss, the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. If we identify that an other-than-temporary impairment loss has occurred, we then determine whether we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. If we determine that we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, the amount of the impairment loss related to the credit loss will be recorded in earnings, and the remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. If we determine that we intend to sell the security, or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses, the full amount of the other-than-temporary impairment will be recognized in earnings.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PPIX determined that none of its securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. Adverse investment market conditions, or poor operating results of underlying investments, could result in impairment charges in the future.\nPCA Investments\nIn instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. PCA's assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety required judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\nThe fair value and unrealized losses for PCA's securities that were temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

Fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates which generally translate, respectively, into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments. The fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments also may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of other investments, the liquidity of the instrument, and other general market conditions.\nPIPE evaluated each security and took into account the severity and duration of the impairment, the current rating on the bond, and the outlook for the issuer according to independent analysts. PIPE found that the declines in fair value are most likely attributable to increases in interest rates, and there is no evidence that the likelihood of not receiving all of the contractual cash flows as expected has changed.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PIPE determined that none of its securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. Adverse investment market conditions, or poor operating results of underlying investments, could result in impairment charges in the future.\nOur management reviews the reasonableness of the pricing provided by the independent pricing service by employing various analytical procedures. Our management reviews all securities to identify recent downgrades, significant changes in pricing, and pricing anomalies on individual securities relative to other similar securities. This will include looking for relative consistency across securities in common sectors, durations, and credit ratings. This review will also include all fixed maturity securities rated lower than \u201cA\u201d by Moody's or S&P. If, after this review, management does not believe the pricing for any security is a reasonable estimate of fair value, then it will seek to resolve the discrepancy through discussions with the pricing service. In its review, management did not identify any such discrepancies for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017; accordingly, no adjustments were made to the estimates provided by the pricing service for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The classification within the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, is then confirmed based on the final conclusions from the pricing review.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCertain direct acquisition costs consisting of commissions, premium taxes and certain other direct underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies as the underlying policy premiums are earned. The method followed in computing deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value, which gives effect to the premium to be earned, related investment income, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned. Future changes in estimates, the most significant of which is expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs. If the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, they would be written off.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PPIX's deferred acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unearned premium reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PCA's deferred acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unearned premium reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PIPE's deferred acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unearned premium reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,609 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Reinsurance Recoverable\nWe cede reinsurance risk to other insurance companies. This arrangement allows us to reduce the net loss potential arising from large risks. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders. Reinsurance premiums, losses, and loss adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contract.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nWe exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\nPPIX Deferred Tax Assets\nPPIX had gross deferred tax assets of $1.0 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. A valuation allowance is required to be established for any portion of the deferred tax asset for which PPIX believed it is more likely than not that it will not be realized. PPIX believed it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance had been established at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law. Most of the provisions of this bill affect corporate taxes paid in 2018 and beyond including reducing the top corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%. Under GAAP, however, deferred income taxes are estimated based upon expected tax rates enacted prior to the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, PPIX measured its deferred income taxes at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 using a tax rate of 21%. The effect on surplus was a decrease of approximately $81,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PPIX had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. Federal tax years 2015 through 2017 are open for examination.\nPCA Deferred Tax Assets\nPCA had gross deferred tax assets of $1.4 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, PCA had unused net operating loss carryforwards of $3.9 million and $0, respectively. A valuation allowance is required to be established for any portion of the deferred tax asset for which PCA believed it is more likely than not that it will not be realized. PCA believed it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance had been established at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAlthough most of the provisions of the TCJA does not affect corporate taxes paid until 2018 and beyond, under GAAP, deferred income taxes are estimated based upon expected tax rates enacted prior to the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, PCA measured its deferred income taxes at December 31,2018 and December 31, 2017 using a tax rate of 21%. The effect on surplus was a decrease of $63,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PCA had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. Federal tax years 2015 through 2017 are open for examination.\nPIPE Deferred Tax Assets\nPIPE had gross deferred tax assets of $0.4 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A valuation allowance is required to be established for any portion of the deferred tax asset for which PIPE believed it is more likely than not that it will not be realized. PIPE believed it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance had been established at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAlthough most of the provisions of the TCJA does not affect corporate taxes paid until 2018 and beyond, under GAAP deferred income taxes are estimated based upon expected tax rates enacted prior to the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, PIPE measured its deferred income taxes at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 using a tax rate of 21%. The effect on surplus was a decrease of $94,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PIPE had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. Federal tax years 2015 through 2017 are open for examination.\nResults of Operations of PPIX\nOur results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the MPLI industry in general. The operating results of the United States MPLI industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, changes in regulation, rising medical expenses, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\nOur premium levels and underwriting results have been, and continue to be, influenced by market conditions. Pricing in the MPLI industry historically has been cyclical. During a soft market cycle, price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced MPLI business. The markets we operate in, and the national MPLI markets, are currently experiencing a soft market cycle. Therefore, it is generally unlikely that insurers will be able to increase their rates or profit margins. A soft market typically has a negative effect on premium growth, which can include absolute reductions in premiums written.\nThe major components of PPIX's operating revenues and net income are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,275 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,275 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,733 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(470 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,245 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income, net of investment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized investment losses, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(281 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(260 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Premiums Written and Premiums Earned\nDirect written premium for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.6 million as compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 2% increase. Direct premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.8 million as compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 9% increase. Ceded premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.7 million as compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or an increase of 20%.\nNet Investment Income\nThe following table sets forth PPIX's average cash and invested assets and investment income for the reported periods (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Investment Income, Net of Expenses\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average monthly net investment income decreased from $87,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $28,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX adopted an accounting standard which requires that unrealized gains or losses for equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities for 2017 be recorded against earnings of the exchange. The effect of adopting the accounting standard was to reduce net investment income by $0.8 million or a reduction of the average monthly net investment income amount for 2018 by $70,000. With the exclusion of adopting the new accounting standard, the average monthly net investment income would have been $98,000 and the return on average cash and invested assets would have been 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRealized Investment Gains (Losses), Net\nPPIX had net realized investment losses of $26,000 and $66,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nPPIX's fixed maturity investments and equity investments are available-for-sale because it would, from time to time, make sales of securities that are not impaired, consistent with its investment goals and policies. At December 31, 2018, PPIX had gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of $794,000 as compared to a gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of $250,000 at December 31, 2017. Most of these unrealized losses were attributable to fluctuations in interest rates. PPIX evaluated each security and took into account the severity and duration of the impairment, the current rating on the bond, and the outlook for the issuer according to independent analysts. PPIX believed that the foregoing declines in fair value in its existing portfolio are most likely attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, and there is no evidence the entire amortized cost basis will not be recovered.\nUnderwriting Income (Loss)\nAs discussed above, we evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to using GAAP based performance measurements, we also utilize certain financial performance measures that are used widely in the property and casualty insurance industry and that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These financial performance measures are underwriting income, losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and net written premiums to statutory surplus ratio.\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pretax profitability of a company's insurance business. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these captions is presented in our statements of operations but not subtotaled. The sections below provide more insight into the variances in the categories of losses and loss adjustment expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expense, which impact underwriting profitability.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nPPIX's losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio was 51.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 63.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PPIX had favorable developments of $2.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The favorable development of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to settlement of known claims below the amount for which they have been previously reserved, as well as additional revisions to PPIX's estimate of its ultimate losses for the 2012 through 2015 accident years. The favorable development of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reductions of the ultimate losses for the 2010, 2011, and 2015 policy years which were offset by strengthening the ultimate loss reserves for the 2016 and 2017 policy years.\nAs discussed in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, the MPLI line of business is prone to variability in the loss reserving process due to the extended period of time during which claims can be made. Adjustments to our original estimates resulting from claims are not made until the period in which there is reasonable evidence that an adjustment to the reserve is appropriate.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Underwriting and Administrative Expenses\nTotal underwriting and administrative expenses, including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, were $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. PPIX had $229,000 and $0 in initial public offering and conversion costs that were expensed in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in underwriting and administrative expenses. Administrative costs are directly tied to the amount of premiums written by PPIX in a given period, because the fees payable to SIS were equal to 25% of the premiums written by PPIX.\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX had pre-tax loss of $(164,000) as compared to a pre-tax loss of $(281,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted in income tax benefits of $(101,000) and $(260,000), respectively. PPIX's effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 21% and 34%, respectively.\nNet Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX had a net loss of $(63,000) as compared to a net loss of ($21,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMandatory Assumed Reinsurance:\nWe are required to participate in Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Fund (PIGA), which was formed to pay claims on policies issued by insolvent Pennsylvania domiciled property and casualty insurers. Each Pennsylvania domiciled property and casualty insurer pays PIGA an annual assessment based on its premiums written in Pennsylvania. PPIX incurred assessment fee expense (income) of $44,000 and $(28,000) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancial Position of PPIX\nAt December 31, 2018, PPIX had total assets of $63.6 million as compared as compared to $67.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total assets of $3.6 million is primarily attributable to a decrease in total cash and invested assets by $3.5 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 due to timing of investment in securities and net unrealized losses recognized in 2018 as compared to net unrealized gains recognized in 2017. The decrease in total assets was offset by more premiums written in 2018 as compared to 2017 and an increase in premiums receivable by $0.4 million. Reinsurance receivables also decreased by $0.4 million, which are attributable mainly to the timing of payments from reinsurers.\nAt December 31, 2018, PPIX had total liabilities of $46.8 million as compared to $49.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total liabilities of $2.9 million between December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a $3.4 million decrease in the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, a $0.2 million decrease in unearned and advance premiums, and a decrease in reinsurance payable of $0.3 million, which were offset by a $0.5 million surplus note executed by PPIX during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, PPIX had total equity of $16.8 million as compared to $17.5 million at December 31, 2017. The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to comprehensive loss of $(696,000). The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to comprehensive income of $652,000.\nEffect of Conversion on PPIX\nAs a result of the conversion on March 27, 2019, PPIX merged with and into PPIX Conversion Corp., and PPIX no longer exists as a separate company. Upon completion of the conversions of PPIX, PCA and PIPE on March 27, 2019, the combination of PPIX Conversion Corp., PIPE Conversion Corp., and PCA Conversion Corp., and the offering, the pro forma shareholders' equity of Positive Insurance Company was approximately $69.7 million. This increased capitalization should permit Positive Insurance Company to (i) increase direct premium volume to the extent competitive conditions permit, (ii) increase net premium volume by decreasing reliance on reinsurance, and (iii) enhance investment income by increasing Positive Insurance Company's investment portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of PPIX\nPPIX generated sufficient funds from its operations and maintained a high degree of liquidity in its investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses. The primary sources of funds were premium collections, investment earnings and maturing investments.\nPPIX maintained investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet its obligations without forced sales of investments. PPIX maintained a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds.\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2018, PPIX's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments for continuing operations.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated gross losses & loss adjustment expense payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The timing of the amounts of the gross losses and loss adjustment expense payments is an estimate based on historical experience and the expectations of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary from the amounts stated above.\nCash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(audited) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,122 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,741 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,082 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(595 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,936 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows from operations were $(2.1) million as compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of paid losses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows from investing activities were $1.5 million as compared to $(6.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The smaller decrease in cash flows from investing activities is primarily attributable to the time necessary to reinvest maturing securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows from financing activities were $0.4 million as compared $(0.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flows from financing activities for 2018 is attributable to execution of a $500,000 surplus note between PPIX and PIPE.\nThe Company's principal source of liquidity will be dividend payments from Positive Insurance Company. Positive Insurance Company will be restricted by the insurance laws of Pennsylvania as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to the Company. Positive Insurance Company may pay dividends to us after notice to, but without prior approval of, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department in an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) 10% of the surplus of Positive Insurance Company as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, or (ii) the statutory net income of Positive Insurance Company for the period covered by such annual statement. Dividends in excess of this amount are considered \u201cextraordinary\u201d and are subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.\nThe amount available for payment of dividends from Positive Insurance Company after the conversions without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department is approximately $3.7 million based upon the estimated pro forma statutory surplus of Positive Insurance Company. Prior to its payment of any dividend, Positive Insurance Company will be required to provide notice of the dividend to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. This notice must be provided to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department 30 days prior to the payment of an extraordinary dividend and 10 days prior to the payment of an ordinary dividend. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department has the power to limit or prohibit dividends if Positive Insurance Company is in violation of any law or regulation. These restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity.\nUpon completion of the offering on March 27, 2019, the Company is a public company and is subject to the proxy solicitation, periodic reporting, insider trading and other requirements of the Exchange Act and to most of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, the Company anticipates incurring significant increases in expenses related to accounting and legal services that will be necessary to comply with such requirements. We estimate that the cost of initial compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be approximately $350,000 and that compliance with the ongoing requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will result in an increase of approximately $200,000 in annual operating expenses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPPIX had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital reserves.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that a company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities: interest rate risk, credit risk and equity risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that a company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Each exchange's exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from its significant holdings of fixed rate investments. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value of these securities.\nThe average duration of the fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolios of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE at December 31, 2018 was 3.34 years, 3.13 years, and 3.90 years, respectively. Each exchange's fixed maturity securities investments included U.S. government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities, and corporate bonds, most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates and which may experience moderate fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates. Each exchange carried these investments as available for sale. This allowed the exchange to manage its exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of its investment portfolio by its management, its investment adviser and its board of directors.\nFluctuations in near-term interest rates could have an impact on each exchange's results of operations and cash flows. Certain of these securities may have call features. In a declining interest rate environment these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates. If we are required to sell these securities in a rising interest rate environment we may recognize losses.\nAs a general matter, each exchange attempted to match the durations of its assets with the durations of its liabilities. Each exchange's investment objectives included maintaining adequate liquidity to meet its operational needs, optimizing its after-tax investment income, and its after-tax total return, all of which were subject to the exchange's tolerance for risk.\nThe table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of PPIX's fixed maturity investments measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all of its investment securities that are subject to interest rate changes) at December 31, 2018 (unaudited):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Change\nin Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hypothetical Change in\nInterest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,944 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,252 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,470 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of PCA's fixed maturity investments measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all of its investment securities that are subject to interest rate changes) at December 31, 2018 (unaudited):\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Change\nin Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hypothetical Change in\nInterest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,752 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(875 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of PIPE's fixed maturity investments measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all of its investment securities that are subject to interest rate changes) at December 31, 2018 (unaudited):\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Change\nin Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hypothetical Change in\nInterest Rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,393 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point increase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(695 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,488 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis point decrease\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Credit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer. Each exchange addressed this risk by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that were rated at least \u201cA\u201d by Moody's or an equivalent rating quality. Each exchange also independently, and through its outside investment manager, monitored the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed maturity securities in the portfolio. To limit its exposure to risk, each exchange employed diversification rules that limited the credit exposure to any single issuer or asset class.\nEquity Risk\nEquity price risk is the risk that the exchange will incur economic losses on its equity securities due to adverse changes in equity prices.\nImpact of Inflation\nIncreases in the cost of medical procedures and related services can affect the losses that we may incur in connection with resolving claims under policies that we issue. These cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not implemented on an adequate and timely basis. We, like all insurance companies, establish insurance premiums levels before the amount of loss and loss expenses, or the extent to which inflation may impact these expenses, are known. Therefore, we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation when establishing rates. Because inflation has remained relatively low in recent years, financial results have not been significantly affected by it.\nResults of Operations of PCA\nPCA's results of operations were influenced by factors affecting the MPLI industry in general. The operating results of the United States MPLI industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, regulation and changes in regulation, rising medical expenses, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\nThe major components of PCA's operating revenues and net income are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,012 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,306 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income, net of investment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized investment gains, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,978 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,468 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,510 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Premiums Written and Premiums Earned\nDirect written premium for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $6.3 million as compared to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 18% decrease. Direct premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.9 million as compared to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 11% decrease. Ceded premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 43% decrease.\nNet Investment Income\nThe following table sets forth PCA's average invested assets and investment income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Investment Income, Net of Expenses\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million as compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average monthly net investment income decreased from $48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $27,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA adopted an accounting standard which requires that unrealized gains or losses for equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities for 2017 be recorded against earnings of the exchange. The effect of adopting the accounting standard was to reduce net investment income by $0.4 million or a reduction of the average monthly net investment income amount for 2018 by $35,000. With the exclusion of adopting the new accounting standard, the average monthly net investment income would have been $62,000 and the return on average cash and invested assets would have been 2.38% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRealized Investment Gains (Losses), Net\nPCA had net realized gains of $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net realized gains of approximately $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPCA's fixed maturity investments are available-for-sale because it would, from time to time, make sales of securities that are not impaired, consistent with its investment goals and policies. At December 31, 2018, PCA had gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of approximately $531,000 as compared to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of approximately $160,000 at December 31, 2017. Most of these unrealized losses were attributable to an increase in interest rates. PCA evaluated each security and took into account the severity and duration of the impairment, the current rating on the bond, and the outlook for the issuer according to independent analysts. PCA believed that the foregoing declines in fair value in its existing portfolio are most likely attributable to short-term market trends, and there is no evidence the entire amortized cost basis will not be recovered.\nUnderwriting Income\nAs discussed above, we evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to using GAAP based performance measurements, we also utilize certain financial performance measures that are used widely in the property and casualty insurance industry. These financial performance measures are underwriting income (loss), losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and net written premiums to statutory surplus ratio.\nUnderwriting income measures the pretax profitability of a company's insurance business. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these captions is presented in our statements of operations but not subtotaled. The sections below provide more insight into the variances in the categories of losses and loss adjustment expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expense, which impact underwriting profitability.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nPCA's losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio was 140.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe favorable development of $0.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on all claims-made policy years. The unfavorable development of $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the 2015 to 2017 policy years based on changes in reserve indications from December 31, 2017. The unfavorable development of $(6.1) million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reserve strengthening in the 2015 ($400,000) occurrence policy year, the 2016 ($500,000) tail policy year and the 2017 ($400,000) and 2014 through 2017 ($4,500,000) claims-made policy years. A majority of these changes in indications were related to PCA's new claims management team and a change in reserving philosophy of setting reserves at the expected value as soon as possible when the liability is acknowledged.\nAs discussed in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, the MPL line of business is prone to variability in the loss reserving process due to the extended period of time during which claims can be made. Adjustments to our original estimates resulting from claims are not made until the period in which there is reasonable evidence that an adjustment to the reserve is appropriate.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Underwriting and Administrative Expenses\nTotal underwriting and administrative expenses, including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. PCA had $153,000 and $125,000 in initial public offering and conversion costs that were expensed in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in underwriting and administrative expenses. Administrative costs are directly tied to the amount of premiums written by PCA in a given period, because the fees payable to PTP were equal to 25% of the premiums written by PCA.\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nPCA had a pre-tax loss of $(6.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to pre-tax income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in income before income taxes between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is primary related due to a reduction in net premiums earned of $0.4 million and an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses of $6.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA had an income tax benefit of $(1.5) million as compared to an income tax expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. PCA's effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 21% and 34%, respectively.\nNet Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA had a net loss of $(4.5) million as compared to net income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMandatory Assumed Reinsurance\nEach Pennsylvania domiciled property and casualty insurer pays PIGA an annual assessment based on its direct premiums written in Pennsylvania. PCA incurred assessment expense (income) of $(11,000) and $22,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancial Position of PCA\nAt December 31, 2018, PCA had total assets of $36.0 million as compared to $39.6 million at December 31, 2017. Total assets decreased by $3.6 million from December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Total cash and invested assets decreased by $4.2 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, due to the timing of receipt of reinsurance receivables, lower premiums in 2018 as compared to 2017, an increase of loss\npayments made from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and net unrealized losses recorded for 2018 as compared to net unrealized gains for 2017. Reinsurance receivables, which are attributable mainly to the timing of payments from reinsurers, decreased by approximately $0.1 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, while premiums receivable decreased by $0.3 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, all of which were offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $1.0 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, PCA had total liabilities of $27.0 million as compared to total liabilities of $25.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in total liabilities of $1.3 million is primarily attributable to a $3.6 million increase in the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, a $2.0 million decrease in unearned and advance premium, and a decrease in due to affiliates of $0.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, PCA had total equity of $9.0 million as compared to $13.9 million at December 31, 2017. The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2018 is related to comprehensive loss of $(4.9) million. The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to comprehensive income of $0.6 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of PCA\nPCA generated sufficient funds from its operations and maintained a high degree of liquidity in its investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses. The primary sources of funds were premium collections, investment earnings, and maturing investments.\nPCA maintained investment and reinsurance programs that were intended to provide sufficient funds to meet its obligations without forced sales of investments. PCA maintained a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds.\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2018 (unaudited), PCA's future payments and estimated claims and claims related payments for continuing operations.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated gross losses and loss adjustment expense payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The timing of the amounts of the gross losses and loss adjustment expense payments is an estimate based on historical experience and the expectations of future payment patterns.

This smaller negative cash flows from operating activities was primarily caused by the timing of paid losses and less premiums written in 2018 as compared to 2017. Cash flows from investing activities were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting the time needed to reinvest funds from maturing securities. Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0 as compared to $(0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no cash flows from financing activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements of PCA\nPCA had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital reserves.\nResults of Operations of PIPE\nPIPE's results of operations were influenced by factors affecting the MPLI industry in general. The operating results of the United States MPLI industry are subject to significant variations due to competition, changes in regulation, rising medical expenses, judicial trends, fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment.\nThe major components of PIPE's operating revenues and net income are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,855 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Underwriting loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,559 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(530 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income, net of investment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized investment gains, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,165 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(366 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(799 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(60 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Premiums Written and Premiums Earned\nDirect premium written for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.4 million as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a 6% decrease. Direct premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.7 million as compared to $3.8 million for the December 31, 2017, or a 3% decrease. Direct ceded premium earned for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.3 million as compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a decrease of 51%.\nNet Investment Income\nThe following table sets forth PIPE's average cash and invested assets and investment income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,555 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>521 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average cash and invested assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Investment Income, Net of Expenses\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.4 million as compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average monthly net investment income decreased from $43,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $30,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE adopted an accounting standard which requires that unrealized gains or losses for equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities for 2017 be recorded against earnings of the exchange. The effect of adopting the accounting standard was to reduce net investment income by $0.3 million or a reduction of the average monthly net investment income amount for 2018 by $35,000. With the exclusion of adopting the new accounting standard, the average monthly net investment income would have been $55,000 and the return on average cash and invested assets would have been 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRealized Investment Gains (Losses), Net\nPIPE had net realized gains of $39,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net realized gains of $51,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPIPE's fixed maturity investments are available-for-sale because it would, from time to time, make sales of securities that are not impaired, consistent with its investment goals and policies. At December 31, 2018, PIPE had gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of approximately $453,000 as compared to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities of $188,000 at December 31, 2017. Most of these unrealized losses were attributable to fluctuations in interest rates. PIPE evaluated each security and took into account the severity and duration of the impairment, the current rating on the bond, and the outlook for the issuer according to independent analysts. PIPE believed that the foregoing declines in fair value in its existing portfolio are most likely attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, and there is no evidence the entire amortized cost basis will not be recovered.\nUnderwriting Income (Loss)\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pretax profitability of a company's insurance business. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these captions is presented in our statements of operations but not subtotaled. The sections below provide more insight into the variances in the categories of losses and loss adjustment expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expense, which impact underwriting profitability.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nPIPE's losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio was 86.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 57.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe favorable development of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the 2013 and 2014 policy years. The unfavorable development of $(0.9) million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to reserve strengthening in the 2015 ($1,000,000) occurrence policy year and the 2013 ($500,000) claims-made policy years. PIPE did realize positive reserve development for the 2010-2012 occurrence policy years of $800,000. A majority of these changes in indications were related to PIPE's new claims management team and a change in reserving philosophy of setting reserves at the expected value as soon as possible when the liability is acknowledged.\nAs discussed in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, the MPLI line of business is prone to variability in the loss reserving process due to the extended period of time during which claims can be made. Adjustments to our original estimates resulting from claims are not made until the period in which there is reasonable evidence that an adjustment to the reserve is appropriate.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Underwriting and Administrative Expenses\nTotal underwriting and administrative expenses, including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, were $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. PIPE had $151,000 and $99,000 in initial public offering and conversion costs in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in underwriting and administrative expenses. Administrative costs are directly tied to the amount of premiums written by PIPE in a given period, because the fees payable to PIPE Management were equal to 25% of the premiums written by PIPE.\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had a pre-tax loss of $(1.2) million as compared to pre-tax income of $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had an income tax benefit of $(0.4) million as compared to an income tax expense of $101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. PIPE's effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 21% and 34%, respectively.\nNet Income (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had a net loss of $(0.8) million as compared to a net loss of $(60,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMandatory Assumed Reinsurance:\nEach Pennsylvania domiciled property and casualty insurer pays PIGA an annual assessment based on its premiums written in Pennsylvania. PIPE incurred assessment expense of $3,000 and 27,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancial Position of PIPE\nAt December 31, 2018, PIPE had total assets of $24.9 million as compared to $26.6 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total assets of $1.7 million from December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in total cash and invested assets by $2.5 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, due to the timing of the receipt of reinsurance receivables, lower premium written in 2018 as compared to 2017, increased loss payments made in 2018 as compared to 2017, and net unrealized losses recorded for 2018 as compared to net unrealized gains for 2017. Premiums receivable decreased from 2017 to 2018 by $168,000 and deferred acquisitions costs decreased by $12,000, all of which were offset by an increase in reinsurance receivables, which are attributable mainly to the timing of payments from reinsurers, by $141,000, an increase in deferred income taxes of $131,000, and a surplus note receivable of $500,000 from PIPE to PPIX during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, PIPE had total liabilities of $13.8 million as compared to $14.4 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total liabilities of $0.6 million is primarily attributable to a $198,000 decrease in the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses, a $505,000 decrease in unearned and advance premiums, and a decrease in due to affiliates of $37,000, which were offset by an increase in reinsurance payable of $30,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, PIPE had total equity of $11.2 million as compared to $12.3 million at December 31, 2017. The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2018 is related to comprehensive loss of $(1.1) million. The change in equity during the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to comprehensive income of $32,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of PIPE\nPIPE generated sufficient funds from its operations and maintained a high degree of liquidity in its investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses. The primary sources of funds were premium collections, investment earnings and maturing investments.\nPIPE maintained investment and reinsurance programs that were intended to provide sufficient funds to meet its obligations without forced sales of investments. PIPE maintained a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds.\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2018 (unaudited), PIPE's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments for continuing operations.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated gross losses & loss adjustment expense payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The timing of the amounts of the gross losses and loss adjustment expense payments is an estimate based on historical experience and the expectations of future payment patterns.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash flows from investing activities were $0.2 million as compared to $(5.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The positive cash flows from investing activities is primarily attributable to the time necessary to reinvest maturing securities and the execution of the surplus note receivable between PIPE and PPIX during the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no cash flows from financing activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPIPE had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital reserves.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of Positive Physicians Holdings, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries PPIX, PCA, and PIPE.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the Company's operating results and financial condition as well as the operating results and financial condition for PPIX, PCA, and PIPE than can be obtained from reading the Financial Statements alone. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Company and \u201cItem 15. Exhibits\u201d for the financial statements and the notes thereto of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information that involves risk and uncertainties. Please see \u201cForward-Looking Information\u201d for more information.\nOverview of the Company\nPositive Physicians Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d) is a newly created Pennsylvania domiciled holding company formed to be the stock holding company for Positive Physicians Insurance Company (\u201cPositive Insurance Company\u201d) following the conversions of PPIX, PCA, and PIPE from reciprocal insurance exchanges to stock insurance companies. The Company had minimal assets and liabilities and had not engaged in any operations as of December 31, 2018.\nAs part of the conversions, on March 27, 2019, PPIX merged with and into PPIX Conversion Corp., PCA merged with and into PCA Conversion Corp., and PIPE merged with and into PIPE Conversion Corp. Accordingly, PPIX, PCA, and PIPE no longer exist. Immediately thereafter, PCA Conversion Corp. and PIPE Conversion Corp. merged with and into PPIX Conversion Corp., which then changed its name to Positive Physicians Insurance Company, and became our single insurance company subsidiary and successor to PPIX, PCA and PIPE. Upon completion of the offering, the shareholders' equity of Positive Insurance Company is approximately $69.7 million. This increased capitalization should permit Positive Insurance Company to (i) increase direct premium volume to the extent competitive conditions permit, (ii) increase net premium volume by decreasing reliance on reinsurance, and (iii) enhance investment income by increasing Positive Insurance Company's investment portfolio.\nOverview of PPIX\nPPIX was an unincorporated exchange organized on April 20, 2004 and was licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a reciprocal insurance exchange. PPIX provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence, claims made plus, and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders). On October 9, 2018, Positive Physicians Captive Insurance Company, a sponsored captive insurance company, was incorporated in the State of New Jersey and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPIX. PPCIC was licensed under the New Jersey Captive Insurance Act on October 16, 2018. PPCIC has one protected unincorporated cell, Keystone Captive Group (\u201cKeystone\u201d). Keystone is owned by an insured of Positive Insurance Company.\nPPIX marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies direct to physicians and through independent producers to doctors and allied healthcare professionals who practice in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Ohio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PPIX had direct premiums written of $15.6 million, net premiums earned of $13.1 million, and net loss of $(63,000). At December 31, 2018, PPIX had total assets of $63.6 million and a surplus of $16.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PPIX had direct premiums written of $15.3 million, net premiums earned of $12.3 million, and net loss of $(21,000). At December 31, 2017, PPIX had total assets of $67.2 million and a surplus of $17.5 million.\nPPIX was managed by Specialty Insurance Services, LLC (\u201cSIS\u201d), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, pursuant to the terms of an Attorney-In-Fact Agreement between the exchange and SIS. Pursuant to the terms of the Attorney-in-Fact Agreement, as amended, SIS provided underwriting and administrative services to PPIX based on a percentage not to exceed 25.0% of gross written premiums, less return premiums. SIS, as the attorney-in-fact, had the power to direct the activities of PPIX that most significantly impact PPIX's economic performance. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of SIS on January 1, 2017.\nOverview of PCA\nProfessional Casualty Association was an unincorporated, reciprocal insurance association organized on April 16, 2003 and formed for the purpose of insuring its subscribers against loss due to the imposition of legal liability. PCA provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders). PCA was managed by Professional Third Party, LP (\u201cPTP\u201d) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diversus, pursuant to the terms of an Attorney-in-Fact Agreement between PCA and PTP.\nPCA marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers primarily to doctors and allied healthcare providers who practice in Pennsylvania. In November 2015, PCA was granted a license to write insurance in Michigan and began writing policies in Michigan in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA had direct premiums written of $6.3 million, net premiums earned of $7.1 million, and a net loss of $(4.5) million. At December 31, 2018, PCA had total assets of $36.0 million and a surplus of $9.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PCA had direct premiums written of $7.7 million, net premiums earned of $7.5 million, and net income of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2017, PCA had total assets of $39.6 million and a surplus of $13.9 million. The net loss for PCA in 2018 is attributed to more losses and loss adjustment expenses than originally recorded as well as a decrease in direct premiums written of $1.4 million due a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewal of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PCA's direct premiums written of $4.2 million in 2017 is attributed to loss of a major client, a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewals of policies, and limited new business growth.\nPTP was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PCA pursuant to the terms of an agreement between PTP and PCA. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PTP provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PCA and paid certain expenses on behalf of PCA in exchange for 25% of the gross written premium. PTP, as the attorney-in-fact of PCA, had the power to direct the activities of PCA that most significantly impact PCA's economic performance by acting as the attorney-in-fact of PCA. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PTP on June 4, 2014.\nOverview of PIPE\nPIPE was an unincorporated exchange organized on March 14, 2005, and was licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a reciprocal insurance exchange. PIPE provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders).\nPIPE marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers to doctors and allied healthcare professionals who practice primarily in Pennsylvania.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.4 million, net premiums earned of $3.4 million, and a net loss of $(0.8) million. At December 31, 2018, PIPE had total assets of $25.0 million and a surplus of $11.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.6 million, net premiums earned of $3.1 million, and a net loss of $(60,000). At December 31, 2017, PIPE had total assets of $26.6 million and a surplus of $12.3 million. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.2 million in 2018 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.6 million in 2017 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth.\nPIPE Management was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PIPE pursuant to the terms of an attorney-in-fact agreement between PIPE Management and PIPE. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PIPMC provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PIPE and paid certain expenses on behalf of PIPE for 25% of gross written premium. PIPE Management, as the attorney-in-fact of PIPE, had the power to direct the activities of PIPE that most significantly impact PIPE's economic performance. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PIPE Management on November 23, 2015. SIS, PTP, and PIPE Management merged into Diversus Management in connection with the conversions.\nMarketplace Conditions and Trends\nThe MPLI industry is affected by recurring industry cycles known as \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d markets. A soft cycle is characterized by intense competition resulting in lower pricing in order to compete for business. A hard market, generally considered a beneficial industry trend, is characterized by reduced competition that results in higher pricing. From approximately 2001 until approximately 2007, the Pennsylvania MPLI market experienced a hard market cycle. This resulted in the creation of several alternative MPLI providers, such as PPIX, PCA, and PIPE. The MPLI market began to experience a soft cycle around the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to the large rate increases taken over the previous six years. That soft cycle has continued and has been contributed to by the restructuring of the healthcare industry, partially as a result of the Affordable Care Act. This has resulted in significant price competition as the number of medical professionals practicing independent of hospitals or large professional groups began to decline. According to a study prepared by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d), MPLI direct premiums written have declined by 25.3% on a national basis from 2006 to 2017 and have declined by 15.9% in Pennsylvania and 32.0% in New Jersey during this same time period. This has resulted in lower direct premiums written and lower operating profits for many MPLI carriers.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nPositive Insurance Company derives its revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\nGross and net premiums written\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\nPremiums earned\nPremiums earned are the earned portion of net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on MPLI policies are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. The policies written by PPIX, PCA, and PIPE typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2018, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2018 and the other half would be earned in 2019.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and debt securities. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned and net realized gains and losses on invested assets. With the adoption of an accounting standard as of January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities are included in net investment income. Prior to 2018, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities were charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by Wilmington Trust and the investment committee, who have discretion to buy and sell securities in accordance with the investment policy approved by Positive Insurance Company's board of directors.\nOur expenses consist primarily of:\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims, including legal fees.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses and underwriting and administrative expenses. Policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes, and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Underwriting and administrative expenses consist of salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately, and payments to bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals, rating plans and experience data.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with GAAP, we utilize certain financial performance measures that are used in the property and casualty insurance industry and that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These financial performance measures are the expense ratio, losses and loss adjustment expense ratio, combined ratio, and the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus.\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written, and measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and loss adjustment expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss), net income (loss) and return on equity.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses ratio\nThe losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned. Positive Insurance Company measures the loss ratio on a policy year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. A policy year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior policy years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\nExpense ratio\nThe expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering the company's insurance business.\nCombined ratio\nThe combined ratio is the sum of the losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio and the expense ratio and measures overall underwriting profit. If the combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\nUnderwriting income (loss)\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in the respective statements of operations of PPIX, PCA and PIPE.\nNet income (loss) and return on average equity\nWe use net income (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net income (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. Each exchange evaluated these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that it believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (indemnity losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss adjustment expenses). The loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported and for the future development of case reserves.\nWhen a claim is reported to Diversus Management, its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment to the extent it can be determined or estimated. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, and injury severity, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is contested or settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to resolve, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information becomes available.\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain estimates of reserves for IBNR. These reserves include estimates for the future development of case reserves. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Diversus Management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. Diversus Management may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable. We project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by using the following actuarial methodologies:\n \u2022 Actual versus Expected Model - The Actual versus Expected Model utilizes the actuarial point ultimate loss and defense containment cost (\u201cDCC\u201d) estimates as of the prior reserve review which were adjusted based on the difference between actual and expected loss development during that prior reserve review and the current evaluation to arrive at an updated actuarial point ultimate loss and DCC estimate. The method is dependent on the loss development factors used to determine the expected losses. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method (Paid and Incurred) - The Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method is a blended method that explicitly takes into account both actual loss development to date and expected future loss emergence. This method is applied on both a paid loss development method and an incurred loss development method. This method uses the selected loss development patterns from the two loss development methods to calculate the expected percentage of loss unpaid (or unreported). The expected future loss component of the method is calculated by multiplying earned premium for the given exposure period by a selected a priori (i.e. deductive) loss ratio. The resulting dollars are then multiplied by the expected percentage of unpaid (or unreported) loss described above. This provides an estimate of future paid (or reported) losses that is then added to actual paid (or incurred) loss data to produce estimated ultimate loss. \n \u2022 Expected Loss Ratio Method - The Expected Loss Ratio Method utilizes some measure of anticipated losses and does not consider actual losses. An expected loss ratio, a ratio of anticipated losses relative to some measure of exposure, is applied to that measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year. This method provides stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposure measure changes. This is offset by a lack of responsiveness to actual loss experience. \n \u2022 Frequency/Severity Method - The Frequency/Severity Method estimates ultimate losses by estimating a frequency and a severity component. For each year, the actuary estimates ultimate claims costs and an ultimate average severity. The actuary then multiplies these two estimates together. The method is useful when the claim count development pattern is more stable than the loss development pattern. \n \u2022 Incurred Loss Development Method - The Incurred Loss Development Method utilizes historical incurred loss (the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves) patterns to estimate future losses. This method is often preferred over the paid method as it includes the additional information provided by the aggregation of individual case reserves. The resulting loss development factors (LDFs) tend to be lower and more stable than those of the paid development method. However, the incurred development method may be affected by changes in case reserving practices and any unusually large individual claims. The actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various LDF selections. \nDiversus Management estimates IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as of the financial statement date. Diversus Management then reduces the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by losses and loss adjustment expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for the MPLI business. Finally, Diversus Management considers other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation is affected by the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expense reserves may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\nOur actuary determined a range of reasonable reserve estimates shown in the tables below, which reflect the uncertainty inherent in the loss reserve process. This range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. We believe that the actuarially-determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates, however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The range was determined after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized. The actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on its knowledge and judgment. In making these judgments the actuary typically assumed, based on its experience, that the larger the reserve the less volatility. In addition, when selecting these low and high estimates, the actuary considered:\n \u2022 Historical industry development experience in MPLI; \n \u2022 Historical company development experience; \n \u2022 Changes in the exchange's internal claims processing policies and procedures; and \n \u2022 Trends and risks in claim costs, such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase. \nOur actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related range of anticipated losses. Because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions. The method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by the actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years.\nThe width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated. The ultimate frequency or severity of the claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures.\nSpecifically, the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims, and therefore, the ultimate amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid:\n \u2022 The rate of increase in medical costs that underlie insured risks; and \n \u2022 Impact of changes in laws or regulations. \nThe estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts less than originally estimated or a reduction in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts greater than originally estimated or an increase in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (unfavorable development).\nPPIX Actuarial Ranges\nAlthough the range of loss estimates is determined by the exchange's actuary, the selection of the ultimate loss is based on information unique to each policy year and the judgment and expertise of PPIX's management.\nThe following table provides case and IBNR reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of PPIX as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018 (unaudited)\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of SIS on January 1, 2017.\nOverview of PCA\nProfessional Casualty Association was an unincorporated, reciprocal insurance association organized on April 16, 2003 and formed for the purpose of insuring its subscribers against loss due to the imposition of legal liability. PCA provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders). PCA was managed by Professional Third Party, LP (\u201cPTP\u201d) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diversus, pursuant to the terms of an Attorney-in-Fact Agreement between PCA and PTP.\nPCA marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers primarily to doctors and allied healthcare providers who practice in Pennsylvania. In November 2015, PCA was granted a license to write insurance in Michigan and began writing policies in Michigan in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PCA had direct premiums written of $6.3 million, net premiums earned of $7.1 million, and a net loss of $(4.5) million. At December 31, 2018, PCA had total assets of $36.0 million and a surplus of $9.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PCA had direct premiums written of $7.7 million, net premiums earned of $7.5 million, and net income of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2017, PCA had total assets of $39.6 million and a surplus of $13.9 million. The net loss for PCA in 2018 is attributed to more losses and loss adjustment expenses than originally recorded as well as a decrease in direct premiums written of $1.4 million due a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewal of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PCA's direct premiums written of $4.2 million in 2017 is attributed to loss of a major client, a decrease in extended reporting policies written and non-renewals of policies, and limited new business growth.\nPTP was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PCA pursuant to the terms of an agreement between PTP and PCA. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PTP provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PCA and paid certain expenses on behalf of PCA in exchange for 25% of the gross written premium. PTP, as the attorney-in-fact of PCA, had the power to direct the activities of PCA that most significantly impact PCA's economic performance by acting as the attorney-in-fact of PCA. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PTP on June 4, 2014.\nOverview of PIPE\nPIPE was an unincorporated exchange organized on March 14, 2005, and was licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a reciprocal insurance exchange. PIPE provided medical professional liability insurance consisting of claims-made, tail occurrence and occurrence policies to its subscribers (policyholders).\nPIPE marketed its medical professional liability insurance policies through independent producers to doctors and allied healthcare professionals who practice primarily in Pennsylvania.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.4 million, net premiums earned of $3.4 million, and a net loss of $(0.8) million. At December 31, 2018, PIPE had total assets of $25.0 million and a surplus of $11.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, PIPE had direct premiums written of $3.6 million, net premiums earned of $3.1 million, and a net loss of $(60,000). At December 31, 2017, PIPE had total assets of $26.6 million and a surplus of $12.3 million. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.2 million in 2018 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth. The loss in PIPE direct premiums written of $0.6 million in 2017 is attributable to non-renewals of policies and limited new business growth.\nPIPE Management was a Pennsylvania corporation formed to operate as the attorney-in-fact for PIPE pursuant to the terms of an attorney-in-fact agreement between PIPE Management and PIPE. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PIPMC provided salaries and benefit expenses of the employees, rent and other occupancy expenses, supplies, and data processing services to PIPE and paid certain expenses on behalf of PIPE for 25% of gross written premium. PIPE Management, as the attorney-in-fact of PIPE, had the power to direct the activities of PIPE that most significantly impact PIPE's economic performance. Diversus acquired 100% of the ownership interests of PIPE Management on November 23, 2015. SIS, PTP, and PIPE Management merged into Diversus Management in connection with the conversions.\nMarketplace Conditions and Trends\nThe MPLI industry is affected by recurring industry cycles known as \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d markets. A soft cycle is characterized by intense competition resulting in lower pricing in order to compete for business. A hard market, generally considered a beneficial industry trend, is characterized by reduced competition that results in higher pricing. From approximately 2001 until approximately 2007, the Pennsylvania MPLI market experienced a hard market cycle. This resulted in the creation of several alternative MPLI providers, such as PPIX, PCA, and PIPE. The MPLI market began to experience a soft cycle around the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to the large rate increases taken over the previous six years. That soft cycle has continued and has been contributed to by the restructuring of the healthcare industry, partially as a result of the Affordable Care Act. This has resulted in significant price competition as the number of medical professionals practicing independent of hospitals or large professional groups began to decline. According to a study prepared by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d), MPLI direct premiums written have declined by 25.3% on a national basis from 2006 to 2017 and have declined by 15.9% in Pennsylvania and 32.0% in New Jersey during this same time period. This has resulted in lower direct premiums written and lower operating profits for many MPLI carriers.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nPositive Insurance Company derives its revenue primarily from premiums earned, net investment income and net realized gains (losses) from investments.\nGross and net premiums written\nGross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance. Net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers (ceded premiums written).\nPremiums earned\nPremiums earned are the earned portion of net premiums written. Gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period. Insurance premiums on MPLI policies are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. The policies written by PPIX, PCA, and PIPE typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written on July 1, 2018, one-half of the premiums would be earned in 2018 and the other half would be earned in 2019.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments\nWe invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities (including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses) in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and debt securities. Investment income includes interest and dividends earned and net realized gains and losses on invested assets. With the adoption of an accounting standard as of January 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities are included in net investment income. Prior to 2018, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities were charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost (in the case of fixed maturity securities) and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Our portfolio of investment securities is managed by Wilmington Trust and the investment committee, who have discretion to buy and sell securities in accordance with the investment policy approved by Positive Insurance Company's board of directors.\nOur expenses consist primarily of:\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses represent the largest expense item and include: (1) claim payments made, (2) estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods, and (3) costs associated with investigating, defending and adjusting claims, including legal fees.\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses\nExpenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses and underwriting and administrative expenses. Policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses, premium taxes, and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business. These policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Underwriting and administrative expenses consist of salaries, rent, office supplies, depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately, and payments to bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals, rating plans and experience data.\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date.\nKey Financial Measures\nWe evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability. In addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with GAAP, we utilize certain financial performance measures that are used in the property and casualty insurance industry and that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers. These financial performance measures are the expense ratio, losses and loss adjustment expense ratio, combined ratio, and the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus.\nWe measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written, and measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and loss adjustment expense, underwriting expense and combined ratios. We also measure profitability by examining underwriting income (loss), net income (loss) and return on equity.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses ratio\nThe losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned. Positive Insurance Company measures the loss ratio on a policy year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability. A policy year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year, regardless of when they are reported, as a percentage of premiums earned during that year. A calendar year loss ratio measures losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior policy years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year.\nExpense ratio\nThe expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and net underwriting and administrative expenses (attributable to insurance operations) to premiums earned, and measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering the company's insurance business.\nCombined ratio\nThe combined ratio is the sum of the losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio and the expense ratio and measures overall underwriting profit. If the combined ratio is below 100%, we are making an underwriting profit. If our combined ratio is at or above 100%, we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet premiums written to statutory surplus ratio\nThe net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written, after reinsurance ceded, to statutory surplus. This ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business. The higher the ratio, the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate.\nUnderwriting income (loss)\nUnderwriting income (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums. Each of these items is presented as a caption in the respective statements of operations of PPIX, PCA and PIPE.\nNet income (loss) and return on average equity\nWe use net income (loss) to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net income. In determining return on average equity for a given year, net income (loss) is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes. Each exchange evaluated these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that it believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. We believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe maintain reserves for the payment of claims (indemnity losses) and expenses related to adjusting those claims (loss adjustment expenses). The loss reserves consist of case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported and for the future development of case reserves.\nWhen a claim is reported to Diversus Management, its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment to the extent it can be determined or estimated. The amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim-by-claim evaluation of coverage, liability, and injury severity, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. Each claim is contested or settled individually based upon its merits, and some claims may take years to resolve, especially if legal action is involved. Case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information becomes available.\nIn addition to case reserves, we maintain estimates of reserves for IBNR. These reserves include estimates for the future development of case reserves. Some claims may not be reported for several years. As a result, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment reserves includes significant estimates for IBNR.\nWe utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. This actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on established actuarial methods described below. Diversus Management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy. Diversus Management may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements.\nWe accrue liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable. We project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by using the following actuarial methodologies:\n \u2022 Actual versus Expected Model - The Actual versus Expected Model utilizes the actuarial point ultimate loss and defense containment cost (\u201cDCC\u201d) estimates as of the prior reserve review which were adjusted based on the difference between actual and expected loss development during that prior reserve review and the current evaluation to arrive at an updated actuarial point ultimate loss and DCC estimate. The method is dependent on the loss development factors used to determine the expected losses. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method (Paid and Incurred) - The Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method is a blended method that explicitly takes into account both actual loss development to date and expected future loss emergence. This method is applied on both a paid loss development method and an incurred loss development method. This method uses the selected loss development patterns from the two loss development methods to calculate the expected percentage of loss unpaid (or unreported). The expected future loss component of the method is calculated by multiplying earned premium for the given exposure period by a selected a priori (i.e. deductive) loss ratio. The resulting dollars are then multiplied by the expected percentage of unpaid (or unreported) loss described above. This provides an estimate of future paid (or reported) losses that is then added to actual paid (or incurred) loss data to produce estimated ultimate loss. \n \u2022 Expected Loss Ratio Method - The Expected Loss Ratio Method utilizes some measure of anticipated losses and does not consider actual losses. An expected loss ratio, a ratio of anticipated losses relative to some measure of exposure, is applied to that measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year. This method provides stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposure measure changes. This is offset by a lack of responsiveness to actual loss experience. \n \u2022 Frequency/Severity Method - The Frequency/Severity Method estimates ultimate losses by estimating a frequency and a severity component. For each year, the actuary estimates ultimate claims costs and an ultimate average severity. The actuary then multiplies these two estimates together. The method is useful when the claim count development pattern is more stable than the loss development pattern. \n \u2022 Incurred Loss Development Method - The Incurred Loss Development Method utilizes historical incurred loss (the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves) patterns to estimate future losses. This method is often preferred over the paid method as it includes the additional information provided by the aggregation of individual case reserves. The resulting loss development factors (LDFs) tend to be lower and more stable than those of the paid development method. However, the incurred development method may be affected by changes in case reserving practices and any unusually large individual claims. The actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various LDF selections. \nDiversus Management estimates IBNR reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as of the financial statement date. Diversus Management then reduces the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by losses and loss adjustment expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date. The actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results. The specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for the MPLI business. Finally, Diversus Management considers other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate, such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy.\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, legal trends, and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation is affected by the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. We continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, final resolution of the estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expense reserves may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\nOur actuary determined a range of reasonable reserve estimates shown in the tables below, which reflect the uncertainty inherent in the loss reserve process. This range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. We believe that the actuarially-determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates, however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The range was determined after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized. The actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on its knowledge and judgment. In making these judgments the actuary typically assumed, based on its experience, that the larger the reserve the less volatility. In addition, when selecting these low and high estimates, the actuary considered:\n \u2022 Historical industry development experience in MPLI; \n \u2022 Historical company development experience; \n \u2022 Changes in the exchange's internal claims processing policies and procedures; and \n \u2022 Trends and risks in claim costs, such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase. \nOur actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related range of anticipated losses. Because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions. The method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by the actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years.\nThe width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated. The ultimate frequency or severity of the claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures.\nSpecifically, the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims, and therefore, the ultimate amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid:\n \u2022 The rate of increase in medical costs that underlie insured risks; and \n \u2022 Impact of changes in laws or regulations. \nThe estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts less than originally estimated or a reduction in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled or resolved for amounts greater than originally estimated or an increase in the estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (unfavorable development).\nPPIX Actuarial Ranges\nAlthough the range of loss estimates is determined by the exchange's actuary, the selection of the ultimate loss is based on information unique to each policy year and the judgment and expertise of PPIX's management.\nThe following table provides case and IBNR reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of PPIX as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018 (unaudited)\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Case\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>IBNR\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actuarially Determined\nRange of Estimates </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Low </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>High </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical professional liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>"}
