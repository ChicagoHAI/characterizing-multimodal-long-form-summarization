You should review the sections titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our final prospectus (the Final Prospectus\u201d) filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on October 29, 2021.\nOverview\nOur mission is to create new possibilities for people and organizations everywhere by connecting them to the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a changing world. Our marketplace platform, with thousands of up-to-date courses in dozens of languages, provides the tools that learners, instructors, and enterprises need to achieve their goals and reach their full potential.\nWe believe traditional education and training methods are fast becoming outdated. Technological advancements and novel industries have significantly altered the types of skills required of workers, and lifelong training and continuous skills acquisition are becoming the norm. There is a clear need to expand access to learning across traditional barriers such as geography and social demographics.\nUdemy operates a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or Udemy Business, or UB, offerings. Our platform provides 49 million learners with access to over 180,000 courses in over 75 languages and 180 countries.\nUdemy courses address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze platform data to better determine our learners' needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A.\nWithin our marketplace and UB catalog, we provide learners with high-quality content by prioritizing courses based on factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement.\nKey factors impacting our performance\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for us, these factors also pose challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and enhance our results of operations.\nAbility to attract and engage new learners and Udemy Business customers\nTo grow our business, we must attract new learners and UB customers efficiently and increase engagement on our platform over time. We acquire a substantial portion of our learners via organic channels and also use paid marketing to further enhance the growth of our learner base. Our organic channels include those outside of our paid market efforts, such as a Udemy brand name internet search. Once we bring new learners onto our\nplatform, we work to create a best-in-class experience to encourage engagement and drive learning and career outcomes.\nAbility to retain and expand our existing learner and customer relationships\nOur business and results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to drive higher usage of our platform within our existing customer base and our ability to add new customers.\nOur efforts to grow our existing relationships with our consumer learners are focused on increasing their engagement and converting free learners into buyers. New learners to our platform typically begin to engage with our free courses, which serve as a funnel to grow our total learner base and drive referrals to our paid other offerings.\nOur efforts to grow our UB offering are focused primarily on corporate and government customers. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as our value is proven. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new UB customers and expand our existing UB customers' use of our platform by identifying new use cases and increasing the size of existing deployments.\nWe often enter into customized contractual arrangements with our UB customers in which we offer more favorable pricing terms in exchange for larger total contract values that accompany larger deployments. As we drive a greater portion of our revenue through our deployments with UB customers, we expect that our revenue will continue to grow significantly, but the price we charge UB customers per seat may decline, which could reduce margins in the future.\nAbility to source in-demand content from our instructors\nWe believe that learners and UB customers are attracted to Udemy largely because of the high quality and wide selection of content our instructors offer. Continuing to source in-demand content and credentials from our instructors will be an important factor in attracting learners and UB customers and growing our revenue over time. When we offer content as part of the UB and consumer subscription offerings, our instructors agree to contribute such content exclusively through our platform, which we believe demonstrates our ability to increase the value of our platform through unique content.\nAlthough we view the breadth and diverse expertise of our instructor base and the content they create as one of our competitive advantages, a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and as a result a significant portion of our revenue, is attributable to a limited number of our instructors. We experienced minimal turnover among top instructors during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nImpact of mix of consumer and enterprise segments\nOur mix of business among our Consumer and Enterprise segments is shifting, and this shift will affect our financial performance. Content costs for our Enterprise segment are lower relative to our Consumer segment. The mix of customer acquisition methods in our Consumer segment will substantially impact our financial performance. We presently expect that revenue from our Enterprise segment will grow faster than our Consumer segment, which will be beneficial to our overall margins.\nAbility to expand our international footprint\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our revenue outside North America. We see a significant opportunity to expand our offerings into regions with large underserved adult learning populations. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in personnel and marketing efforts to support our international growth and expand our international operations as part of our strategy to grow our customer and learner base, particularly among our UB customers.\nOur investment in growth\nWe are actively investing in our business as we believe that we are only beginning to penetrate our market opportunity, and we intend to continue to invest in our future growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our course catalog, expand our employee base, and invest in our technology development. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization, in encouraging the development of new content, and in expanding our platform offerings and capabilities, will occur in advance of the benefits from such investments, making it difficult to\ndetermine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nPace of adoption of cloud-based skill development solutions\nOur ability to grow our learner base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the overall demand for cloud-based skill development solutions. The market for cloud-based skill development is less mature than the market for in-person, instructor-led-training, and potential customers may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. We believe that as technology becomes increasingly critical to business operations, the need for cloud-based skill development solutions, particularly an integrated enterprise-grade platform such as ours, will increase, and our customer base and the breadth and deployment of usage in our customer base will also increase. However, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand, the future growth rate and size of the market for cloud-based skill development solutions, or the entry of competitive solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of online learning solutions, a trend we believe will continue over the long-term. We believe that this heightened demand for online learning solutions from individuals and businesses contributed in part to the significant increase in revenue we experienced beginning in the second quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (including any potential future waves of the pandemic, either domestically or globally); governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines; the effect on our learners, instructors, and UB customers; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and mobile app infrastructure that impact our learners, instructors, and customers.\nWe have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including transitioning the majority of our employees to remote work and restricting business travel, which have contributed to immaterial decreases in our operating expenses, primarily travel and entertainment expense. We believe that our ability to meet the needs of our customers, end users and instructors has not been materially affected by these precautions. We have not incurred any material increases in our operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. For more information, see Risk factors-Risks related to our business and operations-The COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways.\u201d\nComponents of results of operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from contracts with paid consumer learners and UB customers from access to our online learning platform. We recognize revenue from both our paid consumer learners and UB customers.\nConsumer revenue consists of individual course content purchases made by individual learners, as well as our consumer subscription offerings. Consumer revenue includes the gross transaction value paid by the learner at checkout, net of (a) actual and estimated refunds and (b) passthrough taxes collected from learners and remitted to governmental authorities. After a successful checkout, consumer learners receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting\nservices needed to access the content. Access to the online content on the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfill our hosting obligation to the learner. This series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over the estimated service period. Revenue from single course purchases is recognized ratably over the estimated service period, which is four months from the date of enrollment, while revenue from consumer subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nEnterprise revenue primarily relates to enterprise license subscription contracts with annual or multi-year subscription terms. Enterprise subscriptions are generally billed in advance on a quarterly or annual basis. Subscription revenue excludes any taxes to be remitted to governmental authorities. Access to the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to course content and fulfill our obligation to the UB customer over the subscription term. Because the series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nWe are the principal with respect to revenue generated from sales to consumer and UB customers as we control the performance obligation and are the primary obligor with respect to delivering access to content to our customers.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of content costs, which are the payments to our instructors. Content costs are driven by the means by which we acquired the learner consuming the content. For courses offered on Udemy's consumer marketplace, instructors earn a specific percentage of the net sale amount when a learner purchases the instructor's course. For courses offered through Udemy Business or a consumer subscription offering, instructors earn a pro-rata share of a monthly instructor payments pool for that subscription offering. Each month, Udemy calculates the revenue for each subscription offering, with a fixed percentage allocated as an instructor payments pool. Instructors whose content is included in the collection earn a prorated portion of this pool based on the number of minutes of consumption their courses achieved that month.\nContent costs as a percentage of revenue for our UB and consumer subscription offerings are lower relative to individual course content purchases in our consumer offering. As a result, shifts in the mix between our two offerings is expected to be a significant driver of future changes in gross margin. Content costs are recorded as cost of revenue in the period earned by our instructors. For consumer single course purchases, content costs are incurred at the time of purchase. As consumer course content revenue is recognized ratably over an estimated service period of four months, consumer gross margins are lower in the period of purchase, and higher in the remaining periods of the estimated service period over which revenue is recognized. For our subscription based UB offering, content costs are incurred based on monthly subscription fees, and margins are more stable from period to period.\nCost of revenue also includes payment and mobile processing fees, costs associated with hosting digital content, employee related expenses for our customer support organization, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities and other expenses, depreciation of network equipment, amortization of capitalized software, amortization of vendor relationships and developed technologies acquired through business combinations, and the portion of fees paid to certain reseller partners attributable to their providing customer support services to UB customers. We expect cost of revenue to generally decrease as a percentage of revenue as we increase the percentage of revenue derived from our UB offering.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation, and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate from period to period, we currently expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, as well as personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to customer and instructor acquisition, customer support efforts, amortization of tradenames and customer relationships acquired through business combinations, and brand marketing. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of costs incurred for hosting and customer support services related to providing our platform to free learners. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to the ongoing management, maintenance, and expansion of features and services offered on our platform. Research and development costs also include contracted services, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important to our future growth and to maintain and attract learners to our platform. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars. In addition, we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to our executive, legal, finance, and human resources departments, as well as charges for indirect tax reserves, bad debt expense, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income varies each reporting period based on our average balance of cash and cash equivalents during the period and market interest rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense recorded related to certain indirect tax reserves. Interest income and interest expense were each immaterial for the periods presented.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome tax provision\nOur income tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of these deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. The valuation allowance is driven by our overall loss position, and we will not be able to utilize any of these favorable tax attributes until we are in a taxable income position. When we begin to consistently operate in a taxable income position, we may lift portions of the valuation allowance to recognize and use those tax attributes. Until then, we expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented.

The increase in revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the 44% growth in our UB customer base.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, total Consumer revenue increased by $2.2 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year. The increase in Consumer revenue is primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in revenue recognized in the period deferred from course purchases in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a 7% decrease in monthly average buyers.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, total Enterprise revenue increased by $83.5 million, or 81%, compared to the prior year. The increase in Enterprise revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the number of UB customers, as well as net expansions in our existing UB customer base for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenue.\nCost of revenue, gross profit and gross margin\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>236,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,771 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>279,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>220,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,987 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $236.0 million, compared to $209.3 million in the prior year, which represents an increase of $26.8 million, or 13%. Content costs for the Consumer and Enterprise segments were $131.9 million and $45.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to $136.0 million and $25.4 million in the prior year, respectively. Content costs as a percentage of segment revenue for the Consumer and Enterprise segments were 40% and 24% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to 42% and 25% in the prior year, respectively. In our Consumer segment, payment processing fees decreased by $2.8 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. In our Enterprise segment, customer support costs increased by $8.5 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. Additionally, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, there was an increase of $2.4 million in amortization expense of capitalized software, amortization expense of intangible assets of $1.0 million in 2021 compared to no expense in the prior year, and an increase of $1.2 million related to stock-based compensation expense when compared to the prior year.\nGross margin was 54% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 51% for the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in mix of revenue toward our Enterprise business, which has comparatively lower content costs as a percentage of revenue relative to the Consumer segment.\nOperating expenses\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,423 </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>66,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,464 </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>64,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,627 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,514 </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were $227.0 million, compared to $192.6 million for the prior year. The $34.4 million increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily driven by higher personnel-related expenses of $22.8 million due to headcount growth to grow and support additional demand for our platform, and increased amortization expense of deferred contract costs of $10.3 million due to an expansion of our UB customer base over time. Other drivers of the change include a $2.7 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead, an increase of $1.1 million related to stock-based compensation, and an increase of $1.1 million related to software subscription costs. These changes were partially offset by a decrease of direct marketing costs of $5.7 million.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were $66.1 million, compared to $50.6 million for the prior year. The $15.5 million increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses of $9.5 million, mainly driven by additional headcount, increased software subscription costs of $1.8 million, increased stock-based compensation of $1.6 million, and increased facility- and IT-related overhead of $1.5 million.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were $64.4 million, compared to $50.8 million for the prior year. The $13.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase $9.5 million increase in professional services, mainly related to accounting and tax services to support the growth of our business, an increase of $9.3 million in personnel-related expenses, mainly driven by additional headcount, and a $1.3 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead. These changes were partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, and a $5.1 million decrease related to changes in our instructor withholding tax reserve.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) </td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,130 </td> <td> </td> <td>(99) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>(920) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(975) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1773) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(936) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,091) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other expense, net for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.9 million, compared to $1.1 million for the prior year.

The tax expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to foreign taxes.\nCertain key business metrics and non-GAAP financial metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the key business metrics and non-GAAP financial metrics identified below to help us assess the health of our community, evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly average buyers\nA buyer is a consumer who purchases a course or subscription through our direct-to-consumer offering. The number of monthly average buyers is calculated as the average of monthly buyers during a particular period, such as a fiscal year. Our monthly average buyer count is not intended as a measure of active engagement, as not all buyers are active at any given time or over any given period. We believe that the number of monthly average buyers in a given period is an important indicator of the growth of our business and potential future revenue trends. The decrease in monthly average buyers was primarily driven by benefits from the COVID-19 pandemic experienced during the year ending December 31, 2020, which caused significant growth in our\nmonthly average buyers, in comparison to more normalized results seen during the year ending December 31, 2021.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly average buyers </td> <td> </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUdemy Business customers\nWe count the total number of UB customers at the end of each period. To do so, we generally count unique customers using the concept of a domestic ultimate parent, defined as the highest business in the family tree that is in the same country as the contracted entity. In some cases, we deviate from this methodology, defining the contracted entity as a unique customer despite existence of a domestic ultimate parent. This often occurs where the domestic ultimate parent is a financial owner, government entity, or acquisition target where we have contracted directly with the subsidiary. We define a UB customer as a customer who purchases Udemy via our direct sales force, reseller partnerships or through our self-service platform. We believe that the number of UB customers and our ability to increase this number is an important indicator of the growth of our UB and future revenue trends. The increase in UB customers is primarily attributable to the continued pursuit of our global land and expand strategy, as well as growth of our enterprise sales force.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Udemy Business customers </td> <td> </td> <td>10,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUdemy Business Annual Recurring Revenue\nWe disclose our UB Annual Recurring Revenue, or ARR, as a measure of our Enterprise revenue growth. ARR represents the annualized value of our UB customer contracts on the last day of a given period. Only revenue from closed UB contracts with active seats as of the last day of the period are included. The increase in UB ARR was primarily driven by an increase in the number of UB customers, as well as an increase in the average deal size per new customer and net expansions in our existing UB customer base. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in UB ARR.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Udemy Business annual recurring revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>239,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,079 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUdemy Business Net Dollar Retention Rate\nWe disclose our UB Net Dollar Retention Rate, or NDRR, as a measure of our Enterprise revenue growth. We believe NDRR is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our UB customers. We calculate NDRR as the total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of a trailing twelve-month period divided by the total ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period for the cohort of UB customers active at the beginning of the trailing twelve-month period. Total ARR at the end of a trailing twelve-month period is calculated as ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period that is then adjusted for upsells, downsells, and churns for the same cohort of customers during that period. ARR is the total annualized run-rate revenue of all UB customers with active licenses. Our NDRR is expected to fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the\ngrowth of our revenue base, the penetration within our learner base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our UB customers.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Udemy Business net dollar retention rate </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>132 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment revenue and segment gross profit\nOur revenue is generated from our consumer and UB offerings, each of which is an individual segment of our business. Segment revenue represents the revenue recognized from each of these offerings and is a key measure of the performance of our platform, and in turn drives our financial performance. We also monitor segment gross profit as a key metric to help evaluate the financial performance of our individual segments and our business as a whole. Segment gross profit is defined as segment revenue less segment costs of revenue, which include content costs, hosting and platform costs, customer support services, and payment processing fees that are allocable to each segment. Segment gross profit excludes amortization of capitalized software, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and stock-based compensation allocated to cost of revenue as our chief operating decision maker does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Content costs, which are payments made to our instructors, are the largest individual component of segment cost of revenue. We expect to increase the percentage of our revenue derived from our Enterprise segment over time, which we expect will improve our gross margins.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in the Consumer segment gross margin was primarily due to a reduction in consumer content costs and payment processing fees as a percentage of Consumer revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Enterprise segment gross margin was consistent with the prior year, as the mix of as content costs, hosting costs, payment processing fees, and customer support services all remained a consistent percentage of Enterprise revenue when compared to the prior year.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer segment revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer segment gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer segment gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise segment revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise segment gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise segment gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP financial metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP financial metrics identified below to help us evaluate our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin\nAs adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders, adjusted to exclude:\n\u2022interest expense (income), net;\n\u2022provision for income taxes;\n\u2022depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022other expense (income), net.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,703) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted to exclude the following: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense (income), net </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>1,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>15,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>34,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,963 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td> </td> <td>920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,930) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,707) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(50,328) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides a comparison of net loss margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted EBITDA margin (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>429,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80,026) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,703) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss margin </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>515,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>429,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,930) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30,707) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(50,328) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss decreased by $2.4 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to strong revenue growth in both our consumer and UB offerings in excess of the growth of our expenses.\nNet loss increased by $7.9 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA increased by $19.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to strong revenue growth in both our consumer and UB offerings in excess of the growth of our expenses.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $536.8 million, compared to $177.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Our non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents have been earmarked for indefinite investment in our operations outside the U.S., and consequently no U.S. current or deferred taxes\nhave been accrued on such amounts. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.\nSources of funds\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through revenue, as well as proceeds from issuances of our capital stock. In October 2021, we received net proceeds of $397.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $23.1 million, from our IPO. In November 2021, underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $17.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $1.0 million.\nUse of funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding our operations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We have generated significant net losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $458.5 as of December 31, 2021. With the exception of positive operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we have historically incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations as we have invested to support the growth of our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the development of our platform and the growth of our business. We cannot be certain our revenue will grow sufficiently to offset our operating expense increases. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to support our operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,104) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,455) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52,693) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,537) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>418,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>358,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nCash used in operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred sales commissions, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period.\nOur main source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenses, instructor payments, advertising expenses, indirect taxes, and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 net cash used in operating activities was $7.1 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $80.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $68.1 million. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $66.6 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth, which was offset by a $27.0 million increase in accounts receivable, a $36.5 million increase in deferred contract costs and a $9.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $77.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $50.4 million and net cash inflows of $36.9 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $54.7 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth and an increase of $17.5 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which were offset by a $19.6 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $18.9 million increase in deferred contract costs.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $16.5 million primarily consisting of our net loss of $69.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $21.5 million and net cash inflows of $31.7 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $25.3 million increase in deferred revenue, resulting primarily from our enterprise business growth, a $26.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in accounts receivable and a $10.7 million increase in deferred contract costs.\nInvesting activities\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $52.7 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of CorpU, strategic investments, capital expenditures for property and equipment, and capitalized software costs.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million, primarily as a result of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $14.6 million, primarily as a result of net sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs.\nFinancing activities\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $418.6 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from our initial public offering, as well as issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises, offset by payments of redeemable convertible preferred stock issuance costs and deferred offering costs.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $131.1 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from our issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.3 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nDuring the period presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue recognition\nWe derive revenue from contracts with customers for access to our online learning platform and related services. We derive our revenue from consumer and UB customer arrangements.\nConsumer revenue-We generate revenue by selling access to course content on the Udemy platform to general consumers. Consumer offerings consist of (i) single course purchases and (ii) consumer subscription offerings. All contracts with consumer customers are billed in advance and require payment by the customer prior to accessing any course content.\nConsumers who purchase an individual course receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting services needed to access the content. Because consumers who purchase an individual course receive lifetime access to their purchased content, we believe the estimated service period best represents the time period during which learners access the online course content on the platform. The estimated service period for single course purchases is four months from the date of enrollment.\nConsumer subscriptions are typically one-month in duration and paid in advance, with new customers able to sign up for a 7-day free trial period. Subscribers have continuous access to enroll in and consume an unlimited number of curated courses included in the subscription catalog on our platform during the subscription term. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term.\nEnterprise revenue-We sell subscription licenses to business, government, and university customers that provide users the ability to enroll in courses and receive certifications upon completion. UB contracts are typically between one and three years in length and consist of a fixed quantity of seat licenses, which allows each seat to access an unlimited number of course enrollments during the contract term. We recognize revenue ratably over the contracted period, after access has been granted to the UB customer, as learners have unlimited access to the course content during the contracted period.\nWe have determined that we are the principal to customers who purchase access to online individual course content or through a subscription offering, as we control the promised goods or services (i.e., access to course content via the Udemy platform) before it is transferred to the customer and are primarily responsible for fulfillment with respect to delivering access to course content. We also have substantial discretion to determine the pricing of our offerings. We therefore report revenue related to these arrangements based on the gross purchase price paid by customers.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of promised services is transferred. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606 through the following five steps:\n1) Identify the contract with a customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party's rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. Consumer customers are generally required to pay in advance using a credit card. Generally, UB customers are billed upfront annually for contracts with terms of one year or longer or in advance quarterly or semi-annually for contracts with terms of less than one year.\n2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nWe offer a single, combined performance obligation, which is the customer's access to the online content on the Udemy platform, representing a series of distinct services as we continually fulfill our obligation to provide the customer access to the online licensed content with the functionality of the Udemy platform.\n3) Determine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. The prices for consumer and UB contracts are fixed at contract inception and do not contain significant estimates related to variable consideration. With respect to single course purchases, consumers may request a full refund within 30 days after the initial purchase transaction. We estimate and establish a refund reserve based on historical refund rates, which has historically been immaterial. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).\n4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligation's relative standalone selling price. As access to content is not considered distinct from the Udemy platform hosting services, the transaction price is allocated to a single performance obligation.\n5) Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We have a stand ready obligation to deliver our services continually throughout the requisite contract period, which is either lifetime access for consumer customers or the contractual subscription term for UB and consumer subscription customers. As such, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis as we satisfy our performance obligation, using an estimated service period for individual consumers enrollments and the contractual subscription term for UB and consumer subscription customers.\nCommon stock valuations\nSubsequent to our IPO in October 2021, the fair value of common stock is determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.\nPrior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards has historically been determined by our board of directors, with input from management and corroboration from contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our board of directors has the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. Given the absence of a public trading market of our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each grant date. These factors include:\n\u2022 contemporaneous valuations of our common stock performed by independent third-party specialists;\n\u2022 the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\n\u2022 the prices paid for redeemable convertible preferred stock sold to third-party investors by us and prices paid in secondary transactions of common stock, including any tender offers;\n\u2022 the lack of marketability inherent in our common stock;\n\u2022 our actual operating and financial performance;\n\u2022 our current business conditions and projections;\n\u2022 the hiring of key personnel and the experience of our management;\n\u2022 our history and the introduction of new offerings;\n\u2022 our stage of development;\n\u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, a merger, or acquisition of our company given prevailing market conditions;\n\u2022 the operational and financial performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and\n\u2022 the U.S. and global capital market conditions and overall economic conditions.\nOur board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by first determining the enterprise value of our business, and then allocating the value among the various classes of our equity securities to derive a per share value of our common stock.\nFor valuations conducted prior to March 31, 2021, the enterprise value of our business was primarily estimated by reference to the closest round of equity financing preceding the date of the valuation. Valuations conducted as of March 31, 2021, and onward utilized multiple valuation approaches, including a market approach, income approach, and a market transaction method approach considering secondary stock sale or tender offer transactions in our common stock.\nA market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar in industry and/or business model to us. This methodology uses guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples and ratios for key metrics (such as revenue), which are then applied to the corresponding financial metrics to derive enterprise value. Since no two companies are perfectly comparable, premiums or discounts may also be applied to the metrics, for example, if its position in its industry is significantly different from the position of the guideline companies. An income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows that the business is expected to generate over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a company in a similar industry or having similar operational and growth characteristics.\nFor valuations conducted prior to March 31, 2021, the enterprise value of our business as determined above was then allocated to common stock using the option-pricing method, or the OPM, which models each class of stock as a call option with a unique claim on our assets. Valuations conducted as of March 31, 2021, and onward used a combination of the OPM and probability weighted expected return method, or the PWERM, to allocate the enterprise value of our business among the various classes of stock. Under the PWERM, the value of a company's particular equity class is estimated based on an analysis of future values for the entire enterprise assuming discrete future outcomes, such as an IPO of our common stock and other non-IPO outcomes. Share value is based upon the probability-weighted present value of these expected outcomes, as well as the rights of each class of preferred and common stock. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and non-IPO outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield.\nIn addition, we considered any secondary transactions and tender offers involving our capital stock. In our evaluation of those transactions, we considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange and assigned the transactions an appropriate weighting in the valuation of our common stock. Factors considered include the nature of the transactions, the level of company involvement in the transactions, number of different buyers and sellers, transaction volume, timing relative to the valuation date, whether the transactions occurred between willing and unrelated parties, and whether the transactions involved investors with access to our financial information.\nApplication of these approaches and methodologies involves the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable public companies, and the probability of and timing associated with possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nStock-based compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation from stock-based awards using the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Stock-based awards include stock options, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), stock appreciation rights ( SARs\u201d), and restricted stock granted to employees, directors, and non-employees, and stock purchase rights granted to employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP Rights\u201d).\nWe estimate the fair value of RSUs and restricted stock based on the fair value on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock options, SARs, and ESPP Rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of the following subjective and complex assumptions:\nExpected Term-For stock options and SARs, we use the midpoint of the vesting term and contractual expiration period to compute the expected term, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. For ESPP Rights, the expected term is equal to the purchase periods in a given offering period.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the award's expected term.\nExpected Volatility-Since we do not have a sufficient trading history of its common stock, we estimate volatility based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies.\nDividend Yield-The expected dividend was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so.\nStock appreciation rights granted to employees are settled in cash upon exercise and are accounted for as a liability. Vested and outstanding SARs are subject to remeasurement using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions described above, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of expense. We adjust the fair value of the liability for vested and outstanding SARs until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the SARs.\nFor awards with only service-based vesting conditions, we recognize the resulting stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Stock-based compensation for awards that are subject to performance conditions are attributed separately for each vesting tranche of the award. The Company accounts for forfeitures in the period they occur.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nInstructor withholding tax obligations\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States and the rest of the world. We have an obligation to comply with information reporting and tax withholding requirements with regards to certain payments made to our U.S. and non-U.S. instructors. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, in the case where we withhold less than the correct amount of tax, we are liable for the correct amount that we were required to withhold, plus interest and potential penalties. We may be entitled to relief on certain payments if we can obtain documentation (e.g., taxpayer identification forms) from instructors establishing that the instructor payee qualifies for reduced withholding tax rates, or that the instructor payee reported the payments and paid the corresponding taxes owed.\nBeginning in March 2020, we began collecting appropriate taxpayer identification forms from our instructors, assessing whether the forms justified a reduced rate of withholding or withholding exemption, and remitting withholding tax payments to the IRS where required. Prior to March 2020, we had not obtained appropriate taxpayer identification forms from instructors, nor remitted applicable tax withholding amounts to the IRS where required. In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a provision for our tax exposure when it was both probable\nthat a liability had been incurred and the amount of the exposure could be reasonably estimated. Changes to the withholding tax reserve and estimated interest are recorded in general and administrative expense and interest income (expense), respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations.\nEvaluating potential outcomes for instructor withholding taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions and estimates in determining our reserves. The instructor withholding provision estimate includes several key assumptions including, but not limited to, the tax characterization of our payments made to instructors, the historical lookback practices and scoping precedents of the IRS, the methods for sourcing of instructor payments to U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and management's estimate of the relief on certain instructor payments to which we will be entitled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of our instructor withholding tax obligations may be greater or less than the amounts we have reserved.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and our reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. A valuation allowance is established if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations, and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nBusiness combinations\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the acquisition date of business combinations. The purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity interests issued, after considering any transactions that are separate from the business combination. The excess of fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer bases, acquired technology and acquired trade names, useful lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. Significant estimates in valuing deferred revenue include, but are not limited to, cost to service plus a profit markup.\nThe estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision as additional information is obtained during the measurement period for an acquisition, which may last up to one year from the acquisition date. During the measurement period, management may record adjustments to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. After the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Management tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over assets acquired in the Company's business combinations. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nJOBS Act transition period\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. It includes information on the company's operations, revenue sources, trends, key factors impacting performance, ability to attract new customers, retention of existing relationships, content sourcing, impact of COVID-19, operating expenses, and results of operations. The company's revenue increased by 20% to $515.7 million, primarily driven by the growth in the Enterprise segment. The cost of revenue increased by 13% to $236.0 million, resulting in a gross profit of $279.6 million and a gross margin of 54%. Operating expenses increased to $357.5 million, resulting in a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $80.0 million.

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our final prospectus (the Final Prospectus\u201d) filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on October 29, 2021.\nOverview\nOur mission is to create new possibilities for people and organizations everywhere by connecting them to the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a changing world. Our marketplace platform, with thousands of up-to-date courses in dozens of languages, provides the tools that learners, instructors, and enterprises need to achieve their goals and reach their full potential.\nWe believe traditional education and training methods are fast becoming outdated. Technological advancements and novel industries have significantly altered the types of skills required of workers, and lifelong training and continuous skills acquisition are becoming the norm. There is a clear need to expand access to learning across traditional barriers such as geography and social demographics.\nUdemy operates a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or Udemy Business, or UB, offerings. Our platform provides 49 million learners with access to over 180,000 courses in over 75 languages and 180 countries.\nUdemy courses address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze platform data to better determine our learners' needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A.\nWithin our marketplace and UB catalog, we provide learners with high-quality content by prioritizing courses based on factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement.\nKey factors impacting our performance\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for us, these factors also pose challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and enhance our results of operations.\nAbility to attract and engage new learners and Udemy Business customers\nTo grow our business, we must attract new learners and UB customers efficiently and increase engagement on our platform over time. We acquire a substantial portion of our learners via organic channels and also use paid marketing to further enhance the growth of our learner base. Our organic channels include those outside of our paid market efforts, such as a Udemy brand name internet search. Once we bring new learners onto our\nplatform, we work to create a best-in-class experience to encourage engagement and drive learning and career outcomes.\nAbility to retain and expand our existing learner and customer relationships\nOur business and results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to drive higher usage of our platform within our existing customer base and our ability to add new customers.\nOur efforts to grow our existing relationships with our consumer learners are focused on increasing their engagement and converting free learners into buyers. New learners to our platform typically begin to engage with our free courses, which serve as a funnel to grow our total learner base and drive referrals to our paid other offerings.\nOur efforts to grow our UB offering are focused primarily on corporate and government customers. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as our value is proven. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new UB customers and expand our existing UB customers' use of our platform by identifying new use cases and increasing the size of existing deployments.\nWe often enter into customized contractual arrangements with our UB customers in which we offer more favorable pricing terms in exchange for larger total contract values that accompany larger deployments. As we drive a greater portion of our revenue through our deployments with UB customers, we expect that our revenue will continue to grow significantly, but the price we charge UB customers per seat may decline, which could reduce margins in the future.\nAbility to source in-demand content from our instructors\nWe believe that learners and UB customers are attracted to Udemy largely because of the high quality and wide selection of content our instructors offer. Continuing to source in-demand content and credentials from our instructors will be an important factor in attracting learners and UB customers and growing our revenue over time. When we offer content as part of the UB and consumer subscription offerings, our instructors agree to contribute such content exclusively through our platform, which we believe demonstrates our ability to increase the value of our platform through unique content.\nAlthough we view the breadth and diverse expertise of our instructor base and the content they create as one of our competitive advantages, a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and as a result a significant portion of our revenue, is attributable to a limited number of our instructors. We experienced minimal turnover among top instructors during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nImpact of mix of consumer and enterprise segments\nOur mix of business among our Consumer and Enterprise segments is shifting, and this shift will affect our financial performance. Content costs for our Enterprise segment are lower relative to our Consumer segment. The mix of customer acquisition methods in our Consumer segment will substantially impact our financial performance. We presently expect that revenue from our Enterprise segment will grow faster than our Consumer segment, which will be beneficial to our overall margins.\nAbility to expand our international footprint\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our revenue outside North America. We see a significant opportunity to expand our offerings into regions with large underserved adult learning populations. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in personnel and marketing efforts to support our international growth and expand our international operations as part of our strategy to grow our customer and learner base, particularly among our UB customers.\nOur investment in growth\nWe are actively investing in our business as we believe that we are only beginning to penetrate our market opportunity, and we intend to continue to invest in our future growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our course catalog, expand our employee base, and invest in our technology development. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization, in encouraging the development of new content, and in expanding our platform offerings and capabilities, will occur in advance of the benefits from such investments, making it difficult to\ndetermine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nPace of adoption of cloud-based skill development solutions\nOur ability to grow our learner base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the overall demand for cloud-based skill development solutions. The market for cloud-based skill development is less mature than the market for in-person, instructor-led-training, and potential customers may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. We believe that as technology becomes increasingly critical to business operations, the need for cloud-based skill development solutions, particularly an integrated enterprise-grade platform such as ours, will increase, and our customer base and the breadth and deployment of usage in our customer base will also increase. However, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand, the future growth rate and size of the market for cloud-based skill development solutions, or the entry of competitive solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of online learning solutions, a trend we believe will continue over the long-term. We believe that this heightened demand for online learning solutions from individuals and businesses contributed in part to the significant increase in revenue we experienced beginning in the second quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (including any potential future waves of the pandemic, either domestically or globally); governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines; the effect on our learners, instructors, and UB customers; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and mobile app infrastructure that impact our learners, instructors, and customers.\nWe have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including transitioning the majority of our employees to remote work and restricting business travel, which have contributed to immaterial decreases in our operating expenses, primarily travel and entertainment expense. We believe that our ability to meet the needs of our customers, end users and instructors has not been materially affected by these precautions. We have not incurred any material increases in our operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. For more information, see Risk factors-Risks related to our business and operations-The COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways.\u201d\nComponents of results of operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from contracts with paid consumer learners and UB customers from access to our online learning platform. We recognize revenue from both our paid consumer learners and UB customers.\nConsumer revenue consists of individual course content purchases made by individual learners, as well as our consumer subscription offerings. Consumer revenue includes the gross transaction value paid by the learner at checkout, net of (a) actual and estimated refunds and (b) passthrough taxes collected from learners and remitted to governmental authorities. After a successful checkout, consumer learners receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting\nservices needed to access the content. Access to the online content on the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfill our hosting obligation to the learner. This series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over the estimated service period. Revenue from single course purchases is recognized ratably over the estimated service period, which is four months from the date of enrollment, while revenue from consumer subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nEnterprise revenue primarily relates to enterprise license subscription contracts with annual or multi-year subscription terms. Enterprise subscriptions are generally billed in advance on a quarterly or annual basis. Subscription revenue excludes any taxes to be remitted to governmental authorities. Access to the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to course content and fulfill our obligation to the UB customer over the subscription term. Because the series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nWe are the principal with respect to revenue generated from sales to consumer and UB customers as we control the performance obligation and are the primary obligor with respect to delivering access to content to our customers.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of content costs, which are the payments to our instructors. Content costs are driven by the means by which we acquired the learner consuming the content. For courses offered on Udemy's consumer marketplace, instructors earn a specific percentage of the net sale amount when a learner purchases the instructor's course. For courses offered through Udemy Business or a consumer subscription offering, instructors earn a pro-rata share of a monthly instructor payments pool for that subscription offering. Each month, Udemy calculates the revenue for each subscription offering, with a fixed percentage allocated as an instructor payments pool. Instructors whose content is included in the collection earn a prorated portion of this pool based on the number of minutes of consumption their courses achieved that month.\nContent costs as a percentage of revenue for our UB and consumer subscription offerings are lower relative to individual course content purchases in our consumer offering. As a result, shifts in the mix between our two offerings is expected to be a significant driver of future changes in gross margin. Content costs are recorded as cost of revenue in the period earned by our instructors. For consumer single course purchases, content costs are incurred at the time of purchase. As consumer course content revenue is recognized ratably over an estimated service period of four months, consumer gross margins are lower in the period of purchase, and higher in the remaining periods of the estimated service period over which revenue is recognized. For our subscription based UB offering, content costs are incurred based on monthly subscription fees, and margins are more stable from period to period.\nCost of revenue also includes payment and mobile processing fees, costs associated with hosting digital content, employee related expenses for our customer support organization, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities and other expenses, depreciation of network equipment, amortization of capitalized software, amortization of vendor relationships and developed technologies acquired through business combinations, and the portion of fees paid to certain reseller partners attributable to their providing customer support services to UB customers. We expect cost of revenue to generally decrease as a percentage of revenue as we increase the percentage of revenue derived from our UB offering.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation, and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate from period to period, we currently expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, as well as personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to customer and instructor acquisition, customer support efforts, amortization of tradenames and customer relationships acquired through business combinations, and brand marketing. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of costs incurred for hosting and customer support services related to providing our platform to free learners. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to the ongoing management, maintenance, and expansion of features and services offered on our platform. Research and development costs also include contracted services, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important to our future growth and to maintain and attract learners to our platform. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars. In addition, we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to our executive, legal, finance, and human resources departments, as well as charges for indirect tax reserves, bad debt expense, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income varies each reporting period based on our average balance of cash and cash equivalents during the period and market interest rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense recorded related to certain indirect tax reserves. Interest income and interest expense were each immaterial for the periods presented.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome tax provision\nOur income tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of these deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. The valuation allowance is driven by our overall loss position, and we will not be able to utilize any of these favorable tax attributes until we are in a taxable income position. When we begin to consistently operate in a taxable income position, we may lift portions of the valuation allowance to recognize and use those tax attributes. Until then, we expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented. The results below are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for future periods. Results are as follows (in thousands):\n\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\n\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\n\nComparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\n\nRevenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $515.7 million, compared to $429.9 million in the prior year. Revenue increased by $85.8 million, or 20%, compared to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Consumer and Enterprise revenue were $328.7 million and $187.0 million, respectively, representing 64% and 36% of total revenue, respectively, compared to $326.5 million and $103.4 million, respectively, representing 76% and 24% of total revenue, respectively, in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the 44% growth in our UB customer base.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, total Consumer revenue increased by $2.2 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year. The increase in Consumer revenue is primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in revenue recognized in the period deferred from course purchases in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a 7% decrease in monthly average buyers.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, total Enterprise revenue increased by $83.5 million, or 81%, compared to the prior year. The increase in Enterprise revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the number of UB customers, as well as net expansions in our existing UB customer base for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenue.\nCost of revenue, gross profit and gross margin\n\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $236.0 million, compared to $209.3 million in the prior year, which represents an increase of $26.8 million, or 13%. Content costs for the Consumer and Enterprise segments were $131.9 million and $45.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to $136.0 million and $25.4 million in the prior year, respectively.

Our organic channels include those outside of our paid market efforts, such as a Udemy brand name internet search. Once we bring new learners onto our\nplatform, we work to create a best-in-class experience to encourage engagement and drive learning and career outcomes.\nAbility to retain and expand our existing learner and customer relationships\nOur business and results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to drive higher usage of our platform within our existing customer base and our ability to add new customers.\nOur efforts to grow our existing relationships with our consumer learners are focused on increasing their engagement and converting free learners into buyers. New learners to our platform typically begin to engage with our free courses, which serve as a funnel to grow our total learner base and drive referrals to our paid other offerings.\nOur efforts to grow our UB offering are focused primarily on corporate and government customers. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as our value is proven. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new UB customers and expand our existing UB customers' use of our platform by identifying new use cases and increasing the size of existing deployments.\nWe often enter into customized contractual arrangements with our UB customers in which we offer more favorable pricing terms in exchange for larger total contract values that accompany larger deployments. As we drive a greater portion of our revenue through our deployments with UB customers, we expect that our revenue will continue to grow significantly, but the price we charge UB customers per seat may decline, which could reduce margins in the future.\nAbility to source in-demand content from our instructors\nWe believe that learners and UB customers are attracted to Udemy largely because of the high quality and wide selection of content our instructors offer. Continuing to source in-demand content and credentials from our instructors will be an important factor in attracting learners and UB customers and growing our revenue over time. When we offer content as part of the UB and consumer subscription offerings, our instructors agree to contribute such content exclusively through our platform, which we believe demonstrates our ability to increase the value of our platform through unique content.\nAlthough we view the breadth and diverse expertise of our instructor base and the content they create as one of our competitive advantages, a significant portion of the most popular content on our platform, and as a result a significant portion of our revenue, is attributable to a limited number of our instructors. We experienced minimal turnover among top instructors during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nImpact of mix of consumer and enterprise segments\nOur mix of business among our Consumer and Enterprise segments is shifting, and this shift will affect our financial performance. Content costs for our Enterprise segment are lower relative to our Consumer segment. The mix of customer acquisition methods in our Consumer segment will substantially impact our financial performance. We presently expect that revenue from our Enterprise segment will grow faster than our Consumer segment, which will be beneficial to our overall margins.\nAbility to expand our international footprint\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our revenue outside North America. We see a significant opportunity to expand our offerings into regions with large underserved adult learning populations. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in personnel and marketing efforts to support our international growth and expand our international operations as part of our strategy to grow our customer and learner base, particularly among our UB customers.\nOur investment in growth\nWe are actively investing in our business as we believe that we are only beginning to penetrate our market opportunity, and we intend to continue to invest in our future growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our course catalog, expand our employee base, and invest in our technology development. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization, in encouraging the development of new content, and in expanding our platform offerings and capabilities, will occur in advance of the benefits from such investments, making it difficult to\ndetermine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nPace of adoption of cloud-based skill development solutions\nOur ability to grow our learner base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the overall demand for cloud-based skill development solutions. The market for cloud-based skill development is less mature than the market for in-person, instructor-led-training, and potential customers may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. We believe that as technology becomes increasingly critical to business operations, the need for cloud-based skill development solutions, particularly an integrated enterprise-grade platform such as ours, will increase, and our customer base and the breadth and deployment of usage in our customer base will also increase. However, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand, the future growth rate and size of the market for cloud-based skill development solutions, or the entry of competitive solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of online learning solutions, a trend we believe will continue over the long-term. We believe that this heightened demand for online learning solutions from individuals and businesses contributed in part to the significant increase in revenue we experienced beginning in the second quarter of 2020. However, the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (including any potential future waves of the pandemic, either domestically or globally); governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines; the effect on our learners, instructors, and UB customers; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and mobile app infrastructure that impact our learners, instructors, and customers.\nWe have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including transitioning the majority of our employees to remote work and restricting business travel, which have contributed to immaterial decreases in our operating expenses, primarily travel and entertainment expense. We believe that our ability to meet the needs of our customers, end users and instructors has not been materially affected by these precautions. We have not incurred any material increases in our operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. For more information, see Risk factors-Risks related to our business and operations-The COVID-19 pandemic could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways.\u201d\nComponents of results of operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from contracts with paid consumer learners and UB customers from access to our online learning platform. We recognize revenue from both our paid consumer learners and UB customers.\nConsumer revenue consists of individual course content purchases made by individual learners, as well as our consumer subscription offerings. Consumer revenue includes the gross transaction value paid by the learner at checkout, net of (a) actual and estimated refunds and (b) passthrough taxes collected from learners and remitted to governmental authorities. After a successful checkout, consumer learners receive a non-exclusive lifetime license to the digital course content in addition to stand-ready access to the Udemy platform hosting\nservices needed to access the content. Access to the online content on the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to and fulfill our hosting obligation to the learner. This series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over the estimated service period. Revenue from single course purchases is recognized ratably over the estimated service period, which is four months from the date of enrollment, while revenue from consumer subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nEnterprise revenue primarily relates to enterprise license subscription contracts with annual or multi-year subscription terms. Enterprise subscriptions are generally billed in advance on a quarterly or annual basis. Subscription revenue excludes any taxes to be remitted to governmental authorities. Access to the Udemy platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to course content and fulfill our obligation to the UB customer over the subscription term. Because the series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual subscription term.\nWe are the principal with respect to revenue generated from sales to consumer and UB customers as we control the performance obligation and are the primary obligor with respect to delivering access to content to our customers.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of content costs, which are the payments to our instructors. Content costs are driven by the means by which we acquired the learner consuming the content. For courses offered on Udemy's consumer marketplace, instructors earn a specific percentage of the net sale amount when a learner purchases the instructor's course. For courses offered through Udemy Business or a consumer subscription offering, instructors earn a pro-rata share of a monthly instructor payments pool for that subscription offering. Each month, Udemy calculates the revenue for each subscription offering, with a fixed percentage allocated as an instructor payments pool. Instructors whose content is included in the collection earn a prorated portion of this pool based on the number of minutes of consumption their courses achieved that month.\nContent costs as a percentage of revenue for our UB and consumer subscription offerings are lower relative to individual course content purchases in our consumer offering. As a result, shifts in the mix between our two offerings is expected to be a significant driver of future changes in gross margin. Content costs are recorded as cost of revenue in the period earned by our instructors. For consumer single course purchases, content costs are incurred at the time of purchase. As consumer course content revenue is recognized ratably over an estimated service period of four months, consumer gross margins are lower in the period of purchase, and higher in the remaining periods of the estimated service period over which revenue is recognized. For our subscription based UB offering, content costs are incurred based on monthly subscription fees, and margins are more stable from period to period.\nCost of revenue also includes payment and mobile processing fees, costs associated with hosting digital content, employee related expenses for our customer support organization, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, facilities and other expenses, depreciation of network equipment, amortization of capitalized software, amortization of vendor relationships and developed technologies acquired through business combinations, and the portion of fees paid to certain reseller partners attributable to their providing customer support services to UB customers. We expect cost of revenue to generally decrease as a percentage of revenue as we increase the percentage of revenue derived from our UB offering.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation, and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate from period to period, we currently expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, as well as personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to customer and instructor acquisition, customer support efforts, amortization of tradenames and customer relationships acquired through business combinations, and brand marketing. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of costs incurred for hosting and customer support services related to providing our platform to free learners. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to the ongoing management, maintenance, and expansion of features and services offered on our platform. Research and development costs also include contracted services, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important to our future growth and to maintain and attract learners to our platform. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars. In addition, we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and costs related to our executive, legal, finance, and human resources departments, as well as charges for indirect tax reserves, bad debt expense, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. In addition, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary from period to period but generally decrease over the long term.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income varies each reporting period based on our average balance of cash and cash equivalents during the period and market interest rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense recorded related to certain indirect tax reserves. Interest income and interest expense were each immaterial for the periods presented.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nIncome tax provision\nOur income tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of these deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. The valuation allowance is driven by our overall loss position, and we will not be able to utilize any of these favorable tax attributes until we are in a taxable income position. When we begin to consistently operate in a taxable income position, we may lift portions of the valuation allowance to recognize and use those tax attributes. Until then, we expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented.

The increase in Consumer revenue is primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in revenue recognized in the period deferred from course purchases in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a 7% decrease in monthly average buyers.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, total Enterprise revenue increased by $83.5 million, or 81%, compared to the prior year. The increase in Enterprise revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the number of UB customers, as well as net expansions in our existing UB customer base for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
