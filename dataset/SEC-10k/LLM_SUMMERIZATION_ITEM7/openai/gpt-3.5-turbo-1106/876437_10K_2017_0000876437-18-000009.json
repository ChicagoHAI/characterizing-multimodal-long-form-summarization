Diluted income per share of $0.95 increased by 10% when compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted net operating income of $517.7 million for 2017 (2016: $396.3 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share of $1.36 (2016: $0.99) each increased from the prior year primarily due to lower losses incurred, net.\nLosses incurred, net were $53.7 million, down 78% as the estimated claim rate on new delinquent notices declined and we experienced higher favorable reserve development on prior year delinquencies when compared to the prior year. New delinquent notices in 2017 increased slightly compared to the prior year due to hurricane activity in the third quarter of 2017, however the estimated claim rate on new notices was approximately 10%, down from approximately 12.5% in the prior year. Our estimated claim rate on new notices primarily reflects improved cure activity due to the current economic environment, but also reflects a materially lower estimated claim rate on our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes. When excluding our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes, our new notice claim rate was approximately 10.5%.\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded during 2016 reflects the repurchases of a portion of our outstanding 2% and 5% Notes at amounts above our carrying values. The loss on debt extinguishment also reflects MGIC's purchase of a portion of our 9% Debentures for which a loss was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component on the purchase date. See Note 7 - \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for these transactions.\nThe increase in our provision for income taxes in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, the increase in income before tax, and an additional tax provision recorded for the expected settlement of our IRS\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 54\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nlitigation. See Note 12 - \"Income taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Tax Act and expected IRS settlement.\nDuring 2017, MGIC paid $140 million in dividends to our holding company.\nBusiness environment\nCurrent U.S. economic conditions continue to support favorable housing fundamentals, such as low unemployment, household formations, and appreciating home values. Given the supply and demand dynamics of the current market, home prices are expected to further appreciate in 2018. Home price appreciation can have a dampening effect on home purchase activity as it reduces affordability for some borrowers, conversely it may increase the demand for mortgage insurance and/or amount of mortgage insurance due to decreased ability of borrowers to fund a similar down payment percentage absent the appreciation. This recent period of favorable housing fundamentals, coupled with, in our view, high lending standards, has provided a favorable credit backdrop for the business we have written in recent years. In that regard, we have experienced a declining delinquent inventory and lower losses and claims paid. Our most recent book years continue to experience a low level of losses.\nThe 10 year (and other) U.S. Treasury benchmark interest rates have increased in recent quarters and mortgage interest rates in response have been, on average, higher during 2017 compared to the historically low rates of 2016. The gradual increase in mortgage interest rates benefited our business in 2017 as persistency increased, while not materially impacting affordability for first-time homebuyers. Further increases in mortgage rates may impact affordability, which could slow housing activity. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates.\nThe private mortgage insurance industry remains intensely competitive and, in some instances, companies have lower premium rates to protect or grow market share. PMI also competes against government mortgage insurance programs such as the FHA, VA, and USDA, primarily for lower FICO score business. The market share of primary mortgage insurance written by government programs continued to exceed that written by PMI in 2017, however PMI recaptured share from those programs due to writing a higher percentage of purchase originations when compared to government programs. Generally, PMI industry share is 3-4 times higher for purchase originations than refinance originations. Amongst private mortgage insurers, our market share increased slightly from the prior year to 18.3% (source: Inside Mortgage Finance).\nRefer to Mortgage Insurance Portfolio for additional discussion of the 2017 business environment and the impact it had on operating measures including NIW, IIF and RIF.\nSince December 31, 2015 we have operated under the requirements of the PMIERs of the GSEs in order to insure loans purchased by them. The PMIERs include financial requirements that require an approved mortgage insurer to have Available Assets that meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC's Available Assets under PMIERs totaled $4.8 billion, an excess of $0.8 billion over its Minimum Required Assets at December 31, 2017.\nA summary of GSE-recommended PMIERs revisions were issued to us late in the fourth quarter of 2017. Refer to \"Capital - GSEs\" below for a discussion of the impact such revisions are expected to have on our excess Available Assets at their effective date, which is expected to be no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBusiness outlook for 2018\nOur outlook for 2018 should be viewed against the backdrop of the business environment discussed above.\nNIW. Our NIW is affected by total mortgage originations, the percentage of total mortgage originations utilizing private mortgage insurance (the \"PMI penetration rate\") and our market share within the PMI industry. As of late January 2018, total mortgage originations are forecasted to decline in 2018 from 2017 levels due to declines in refinancing originations more than offsetting a slight increase in purchase originations. We expect the PMI penetration rate to increase because historically PMI has captured a share of purchase originations, which are forecast to be a higher percentage of total originations, that is estimated to be 3-4 times greater\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 55\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthan that of refinancing originations. Similar to 2017, an increase in the PMI penetration rate should serve to mitigate the decline in total mortgage originations. Although our expectation is for our 2018 NIW to increase slightly from 2017, this will be highly dependent on the actual size of the mortgage origination market, the mix of originations, and competition.\nImpact of tax reform. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Act was enacted that, among other things, reduced federal income tax rates on corporations and eliminated the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\"AMT\"). The reduction in the corporate income tax rate will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 and we expect it to be approximately 21%, compared to approximately 34% when excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement in 2017. In recent years, we have utilized NOLs to reduce our taxes payable, however we were subject to paying taxes under the AMT. The elimination of the corporate AMT eliminates any cash taxes that would have been paid in 2018. We do not expect the changes to individual income taxes included in the Tax Act to materially impact our business.\nIIF and RIF. Our book of IIF is the main driver of our revenues and earnings and its growth is driven by our ability to generate NIW and retain existing policies in force, as measured by our persistency. Interest rates influence both our NIW and persistency. In a rising rate environment, we expect cancellation rates to decline, and in turn increase persistency, although the impact generally lags the change in interest rates. Higher interest rates could reduce affordability for borrowers, which could slow housing activity, and of particular importance to our industry, slow first-time home buyer purchase activity, resulting in less NIW. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates. We expect our IIF will continue to grow in 2018 due to the level of NIW we expect to write in 2018 and our expected persistency.\nResults of operations. We expect our earned premiums growth rate in 2018 to be comparable to that experienced in 2017. The headwinds that have limited earned premium growth in recent years, even with a larger book of IIF, are expected to persist to a certain extent in 2018. Our premium yield is expected to decline in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to changing premium rates, as more fully discussed along with other factors in our \"Consolidated Results of Operations - Premium yield.\" However, we expect increasing IIF to counteract the effect on earned premium of a lower premium yield.\nIn addition to more earned premiums, our revenues are expected to include higher investment income in 2018 due to the increasing size of our investment portfolio, combined with higher average investment yields. We expect 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in the current year (2018) to be lower than the comparable amount for 2017 as we expect to receive fewer new delinquent notices in 2018. We cannot predict the amount, if any, of 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in prior years. The Tax Act will reduce our effective tax rate to approximately 21%, which will reduce the provision for income tax we record against any income before tax. Excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been approximately 34%.\nPMIERs. In December 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. We expect the revised PMIERs to be finalized in 2018 and effective no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018. See \"Capital - GSEs\" below for our discussion of the proposed changes we have received.\nCapital\nGSEs\nWe must comply with the PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In addition to their financial requirements, the PMIERs include business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our NIW. Factors that may negatively impact MGIC's ability to continue to comply with the financial requirements of PMIERs include the following:\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 56\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 18, 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. Once the PMIERs are finalized, we expect a six-month implementation period before the revised PMIERs are effective. We expect that effectiveness will not be earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the GSE-recommended changes are adopted with an effective date in the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that at the effective date, MGIC would continue to have an excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets, although this excess would be materially lower than it was at December 31, 2017 under the existing PMIERs, and that MGIC would continue to be able to pay quarterly dividends to our holding company at the $50 million quarterly rate at which they were paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we expect cash at our holding company at December 31, 2018 would increase over what it was at December 31, 2017.\nWe have non-disclosure obligations to each of the GSEs and cannot provide further comment on the specific provisions of the GSE-recommended changes other than as described above. Until the GSEs and/or FHFA provide public disclosure of proposed or final changes to the existing PMIERs, we do not plan to update or correct any of the disclosure above or provide any additional disclosure regarding any modifications that may occur in the GSE-recommended changes to PMIERs.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our future operating results may be negatively impacted by the matters discussed in our risk factors. Such matters could decrease our revenues, increase our losses or require the use of assets, thereby creating a shortfall in Available Assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources, including for repayment of debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> While on an overall basis, the amount of Available Assets MGIC must hold in order to continue to insure GSE loans increased under the PMIERs over what state regulation currently requires, our reinsurance transactions mitigate the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns.\nState Regulations\nThe insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements.\u201d While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires an MPP.\nAt December 31, 2017, MGIC's risk-to-capital ratio was 9.5 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was $2.1 billion above the required MPP of $1.2 billion. In calculating our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP, we are allowed full credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded to the reinsurers. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transaction, without penalty. At this time, we expect MGIC to continue to comply with the current State Capital Requirements; however, you should read our risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect such compliance.\nAt December 31, 2017, the risk-to-capital ratio of our combined insurance operations (which includes a reinsurance affiliate) was 10.5 to 1. Reinsurance transactions with our affiliate permit MGIC to write insurance with a higher coverage percentage than it could on its own under certain state-specific requirements.\nThe NAIC plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators has been considering since 2016 a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 57\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ninsurers, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to the capital requirements and certain items have not yet been completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk, minimum capital floors, and action level triggers. Currently we believe that the PMIERs contain the more restrictive capital requirements in most circumstances.\nGSE reform\nThe FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. In the past, members of Congress have introduced several bills intended to change the business practices of the GSEs and the FHA; however, no legislation has been enacted. The Administration has indicated that the conservatorship of the GSEs should end; however, it is unclear whether and when that would occur and how that would impact us. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including PMI, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last.\nFor additional information about the business practices of the GSEs, see our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses\u201d in Item 1A.\nLoan modifications and other similar programs\nThe federal government, including through the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the GSEs, and several lenders have modification and refinance programs to make outstanding loans more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. These programs included HAMP, which expired at the end of 2016, and HARP, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2018. The GSEs have introduced other loan modifications programs to replace HAMP.\nFrom 2008 through 2012, we were notified of modifications that cured delinquencies that, had they become paid claims, would have resulted in a material increase in our incurred losses. More recently, the number of modifications has decreased significantly. Nearly all of the reported loan modifications were for loans insured in 2009 and prior.\nWe cannot determine the total benefit we may derive from loan modification programs, particularly given the uncertainty around the re-default rates for defaulted loans that have been modified.

Many factors affect NIW, including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages from the FHA, the VA, other mortgage insurers, GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance and other alternatives to mortgage insurance. NIW does not include loans previously insured by us that are modified, such as loans modified under HARP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cancellations, which reduce IIF. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book, current home values compared to values when the loans in the in force book were insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. Home price appreciation can give homeowners the right to cancel mortgage insurance on their loans if sufficient home equity is achieved. Cancellations also result from policy rescissions, which require us to return any premiums received on the rescinded policies, and claim payments, which require us to return any premium received on the related policies from the date of default on the insured loans. Cancellations of single premium policies, which are generally non-refundable, result in immediate recognition of any remaining unearned premium.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Premium rates, which are affected by product type, competitive pressures, the risk characteristics of the insured loans and the percentage of coverage on the insured loans. The substantial majority of our monthly and annual mortgage insurance premiums are under premium plans for which, for the first ten years of the policy, the amount of premium is determined by multiplying the initial premium rate by the original loan balance; thereafter, the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. However, for loans that have utilized HARP, the initial ten-year period resets as of the date of the HARP transaction. The remainder of our monthly and annual premiums are under premium plans for which premiums are determined by a fixed percentage of the loan's amortizing balance over the life of the policy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Premiums ceded, net of a profit commission, under reinsurance agreements. See Note 9 - Reinsurance\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremiums are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period. A change in the average IIF in the current period compared to an earlier period is a factor that will increase (when the average in force is higher) or reduce (when it is lower) premiums written and earned in the current period, although this effect may be enhanced (or mitigated) by differences in the average premium rate between the two periods, as well as by premiums that are returned or expected to be returned in connection with claim payments and rescissions, and premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements. Also, NIW and cancellations during a period will generally have a greater effect on premiums written and earned in subsequent periods than in the period in which these events occur.\nInvestment income\nOur investment portfolio is composed principally of investment grade fixed income securities. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of the investment portfolio is mainly a function of cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as NPW, investment income, net claim payments and expenses, and cash provided by (or used for) non-operating activities, such as debt or stock issuances or repurchases.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 59\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLosses incurred\nLosses incurred are the current expense that reflects estimated payments that will ultimately be made as a result of delinquencies on insured loans.

The level of new delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern, with new delinquencies in the first part of the year lower than new delinquencies in the latter part of the year, though this pattern can be affected by the state of the economy and local housing markets.

Subsequent years of a book may result in either underwriting profit or underwriting losses. This pattern of results typically occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments) and increasing losses.

These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance.\nAdjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP income (loss) before tax, excluding the effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, net impairment losses recognized in income (loss) and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, where applicable.\nAdjusted net operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the after-tax effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, net impairment losses recognized in income (loss), and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, where applicable and the effects of changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax operating income (loss) are tax effected using a federal statutory tax rate of 35%.\nAdjusted net operating income (loss) per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share, by dividing (i) adjusted net operating income (loss) after making adjustments for interest expense on convertible debt, whenever the impact is dilutive, by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from unvested restricted stock units and from convertible debt when dilutive under the \"if-converted\" method.\nAlthough adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) and adjusted net operating income (loss) exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) impacted by both discretionary and other economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these adjustments. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Net realized investment gains (losses).

</tr>\n</table>\nMortgage Insurance Portfolio\nMortgage originations\nThe primary mortgage insurance market is estimated to have declined in 2017 (table t.02), due to lower refinancing originations (chart c.01). Refinance originations fell as a result of higher mortgage interest rates on average, but continued solid housing fundamentals, such as household formations, low unemployment, and low interest rates supported home purchase activity. Mortgage origination estimates indicate that the decline in refinance volume offset an increase in purchase volume in 2017 compared to the prior year. Mortgage originations in 2018 are forecast to decrease from 2017 estimated levels because of an additional decline in refinancing volume as mortgage interest rates are anticipated to trend higher. However, purchase originations are expected to increase again which generally has a greater impact on the PMI industry as historically the industry's share is 3-4 times higher for purchase originations than refinancing originations. Competition from government mortgage insurance programs, discussed below, will also continue to impact the market share of PMI. In consideration of these factors, our 2018 NIW is expected to be slightly higher than that of 2017.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Chart\n</td> <td>c.01\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nE - Estimated, F- Forecast\nSource: GSEs and MBA estimates/forecasts as of January 2018.

Includes HARP NIW.\nMortgage insurance industry (see tables t.03 and t.04)\nWe compete against five other private mortgage insurers, as well as government mortgage insurance programs such as the FHA, VA, and USDA. We believe that we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on pricing, underwriting requirements, financial strength, customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, the strength of our management team and field organization, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. Much of the competition in the industry centers on pricing practices which, in the last few years included: (i) reductions in standard filed rates on BPMI policies, (ii) use by certain competitors of a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing (commonly referred to as \"black-box\" pricing); and (iii) use of customized rates (discounted from published rates). These pricing practices were driven by both the implementation of the financial requirements of the PMIERs, as well as industry competition to maintain or grow market share. The result of pricing changes in 2016, in which we participated, generally decreased filed premium rates on higher-FICO score loans and increased rates on\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 64\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Insurance Portfolio (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nlower-FICO score loans. We also continue to use authority set forth in our rate filings to provide customized premium rates to qualified lenders. We believe our current rates allow us to compete effectively across many FICO scores; however, there is no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in our NIW and/or returns.\nThe FHA offers fixed premium rates across all FICO scores and often has lower monthly premium rates across lower FICO business, which are effectively cross-subsidized by higher-FICO score premium rates. As a result, we have seen, and expect to continue to see some lenders utilize FHA insurance for the lower-FICO score business for which we compete. However, not all lower-FICO score business is migrating to the FHA because PMI may be cancelable when FHA insurance is not, lenders value our customer service, PMI continues to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to the FHA for many borrowers, and some lenders perceive greater legal risks under FHA versus GSE programs. Any reduction in premium rates by the FHA that create a larger payment differential than at present could result in more business utilizing FHA mortgage insurance.\nEven though the PMI industry's pricing changes raised premiums on lower-FICO score loans in 2016, the PMI industry captured a greater share of the total low down payment (PMI and government programs) insured volume in 2017 and 2016, when compared to the respective prior year (see table t.03). In addition to a higher mix of purchase originations, the increases in PMI share were due in part to new 97% LTV loan offerings from lenders that sell loans to the GSEs, which provided an alternative to similar FHA loan programs for qualified borrowers, and some lenders are shifting business away from the FHA due to perceived legal risks.\nOur market share increased in 2017 when compared to 2016. The decline in our market share in 2016 from 2015 levels was due to the overall competitive environment, and we believe the decline was principally attributable to our maintaining greater pricing discipline than certain competitors in LPMI single premium policies. We plan to continue to focus on writing new insurance that meets our risk-adjusted return thresholds across the spectrum of loans we insure and providing market-leading customer service.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated primary MI market share\n</td> <td>(% of total primary MI volume)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PMI\n</td> <td>37.6%\n</td> <td>35.4%\n</td> <td>34.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHA\n</td> <td>35.6%\n</td> <td>35.5%\n</td> <td>39.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>VA\n</td> <td>24.1%\n</td> <td>26.6%\n</td> <td>23.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>USDA\n</td> <td>2.7%\n</td> <td>2.5%\n</td> <td>2.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSource: Inside Mortgage Finance - February 15, 2018.

We maintained a high percentage of monthly premium business, which is almost exclusively BPMI (see table t.07). Refinancing activity declined in 2017 compared to 2016 when it was particularly strong due to historically low mortgage interest rates that persisted for much of that year. The percentage of NIW from LTVs 95.01% and above increased due to 97% LTV programs offered by lenders, while the percentage of NIW from LTVs 90.00% down to 80.01% declined due to a lower amount of refinancing originations by borrowers whose home values increased but still were required to have PMI.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 65\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Insurance Portfolio (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary NIW by FICO score\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(% of primary NIW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>740 and greater\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>700 -

Cancellation activity is primarily due to refinancing activity, but is also impacted by rescissions, cancellations due to claim payment, and policies cancelled when borrowers achieve the required amount of home equity. Refinancing activity has historically been affected by the level of mortgage interest rates and the level of home price appreciation. Cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates, although they generally lag a change in direction.\nPersistency\nOur persistency at December 31, 2017 was 80.1% compared to 76.9% at December 31, 2016.

Our 2009 and later books possess significantly improved risk characteristics when compared to our 2005-2008 origination years. The loans we insured beginning in 2009, on average, have substantially higher FICO scores and lower LTVs than those insured in 2005-2008. The credit profile of our pre-2009 RIF has benefited from programs such as HARP. HARP allows borrowers who are not delinquent, but who may not otherwise be able to refinance their loans under the current GSE underwriting standards due to, for example, the current LTV exceeding 100%, to refinance and lower their note rate. Loans associated with 96.8% of all our HARP modifications were current as of December 31, 2017. The aggregate of our 2009-2017 books and our HARP modifications accounted for approximately 86% of our total primary RIF at December 31, 2017.\nTable t.10 presents the composition of our primary RIF as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary risk in force\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in billions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>% of RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>% of RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>% of RIF\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2009+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2005 - 2008 (HARP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other years (HARP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other years (Non-HARP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2005- 2008 (Non-HARP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Primary RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPool and other insurance\nMGIC has written no new pool insurance since 2008, however, for a variety of reasons, including responding to capital market alternatives to private mortgage insurance and customer demands, MGIC may write pool risk in the future. Our direct pool RIF was $471 million ($236 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and $235 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2017 compared to $547 million ($244 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and $303 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2016. If claim payments associated with a specific pool reach the aggregate loss limit, the remaining IIF within the pool would be cancelled and any remaining defaults under the pool would be removed from our default inventory.\nIn the second half of 2016 we participated in GSE credit risk transfer transactions through an affiliate of MGIC. Each GSE launched a new credit risk transfer offering that involved credit insurance policies with a pool structure that primarily covered loans to be delivered to the GSE in the future. The policies provide additional coverage beyond primary mortgage insurance on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with 80.01-95% LTVs. These transactions were immaterial to our financial statements in 2017 and 2016 and given the risk insured, are expected to remain immaterial to our financial statements in future periods. We did not enter into any GSE credit risk transfer transactions during 2017 and any future participation will need to be evaluated based upon the terms offered and expected returns.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 67\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>Overview\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Insurance Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated Results of Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Glossary of terms and acronyms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following section of the MD&A provides a comparative discussion of our Consolidated Results of Operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017.

NPW increased 2% from the prior year, due to a decline in premium refunds and lower ceded premiums due to a higher profit commission. Premium refunds declined and our profit commission increased due to lower losses incurred. NPE increased slightly from the prior year due to a decline in premium refunds and lower ceded premiums, which offset lower premiums from our IIF during the year as our premium yield (discussed below) decreased.\n2016 compared to 2015. NPW decreased 4% from the prior year primarily because ceded premiums were lower in 2015 due to the commutation of our 2013 QSR Transaction in the third quarter of 2015, which was a non-recurring transaction. As part of the commutation, unearned ceded premiums were remitted back to us from the reinsurers, and we returned the related ceding commissions, which had the effect of increasing our profit commission. Partially offsetting the higher 2016 ceded premiums was an increase in new business premiums in 2016 and a reduction in premium refunds due to lower claim activity.\nNPE increased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting higher earned premiums from single premium policies and lower premium refunds. The increase in earned premiums on single premium policies was driven by refinance activity as single premium policies are generally non-refundable. The decrease in premium refunds was due to lower claim activity. The increase in net premiums earned was offset in part by the effects of our 2013 QSR Transaction commutation in 2015, which resulted in a non-recurring increase in our profit commission.\nSee \"Overview - Factors Affecting Our Results\" above for additional factors that also influence the amount of net premiums written and earned in a year.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 68\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results of Operations (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremium yield\nPremium yield is NPE divided by average IIF during the year and is influenced by a number of key drivers, which have a varying impact from period to period.

Premiums are ceded on an earned and received basis under the 2015 QSR Transaction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of our NIW subject to our QSR Transactions varies from period to period due to loan level exclusion terms. For example, our 2017 QSR Transaction excludes NIW with amortization terms of 20 years or less, but allows higher limits of DTI and loan levels than our 2015 QSR Transaction. In addition, the QSR Transactions contain coverage thresholds that may be triggered depending on the mix of our risk written during the period. The number of loans we insured with DTIs greater than 45% increased in the second half of 2017 after the requirements of the GSE underwriting guidelines were made more liberal. The risk written on those loans with DTIs greater than 45% exceeded the coverage limit under our 2017 QSR Transaction resulting in the percentage of NIW covered in 2017 to decline from the prior year.\nThe effects of our QSR Transactions described and presented above result in a net pre-tax cost of the reinsurance, with respect to a covered loan, of 6% (but can be lower if losses are materially higher than we expect). This cost is derived by dividing the reduction in our pre-tax net income from such loans with reinsurance by our direct (that is, without reinsurance) premiums from such loans. Although the net cost of the reinsurance is generally constant at 6%, the effect of the reinsurance on the various components of pre-tax income discussed above will vary from period to period, depending on the level of ceded losses. Although the use of reinsurance reduces our pre-tax net income, we receive credit under the PMIERs for risk ceded under our 2017 and 2015 QSR Transactions, which mitigates the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns.\n2018 QSR Transaction\nWe expect that in the first quarter of 2018, we will enter into an agreement covering most of our NIW in 2018, on terms no less favorable than our existing QSR transactions. Compared to our 2017 QSR Transaction, the proposed 2018 QSR Transaction increases the percentage of NIW with the following loan level characteristics subject to coverage: (1) LTV ratios of 95% and greater, and (2) DTIs greater than 45%; however, the 2018 QSR Transaction excludes all NIW with LTV ratios of 85% and below. See Note 9 - \"Reinsurance\" to our consolidated financial statement for additional discussion on the terms of our proposed transaction.

The terms delinquent\u201d and default\u201d are used interchangeably by us. We consider a loan delinquent when it is two or more payments past due. Loss reserves are established based on estimating the number of loans in our default inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity.\nEstimation of losses is inherently judgmental. The conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy, including unemployment and the current and future strength of local housing markets. The actual amount of the claim payments may be substantially different than our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions, including unemployment, leading to a reduction in borrower income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, and a drop in housing values, that could result in, among other things, greater losses on loans, and may affect borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below the mortgage balance. Historically, losses incurred have followed a seasonal trend in which the second half of the year has weaker credit performance than the first half, with higher new notice activity and a lower cure rate. Our estimates are also affected by any agreements we enter into regarding our claims paying practices, such as the settlement agreements discussed in Note 17 - Litigation and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. Changes to our estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position, even in a stable economic environment.\n2017 compared to 2016. Losses incurred, net decreased 78% to $54 million compared to $240 million in 2016. The decrease was due to both a decrease in losses and LAE incurred in respect to delinquencies reported in the current year and favorable development on prior year delinquencies.

Losses incurred, net decreased 30% to $240 million compared to $344 million in 2015. The decrease was due both to a decrease in losses and LAE incurred in respect to delinquencies reported in the current year and favorable development on prior year delinquencies.

Therefore, we expect the average number of missed payments at the time a claim is received to be approximately 18 to 24 for new notices received, compared to an average of 35 missed payments for claims received in recent periods. Our loss reserves estimates take into consideration trends over time, because the development of the delinquencies may vary from period to period without establishing a meaningful trend.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 75\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results of Operations (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of loans from 2005 through 2008 (which represent 62% of the loans in the delinquent inventory) are covered by master policy terms that, except under certain circumstances, do not limit the number of years that an insured can include interest when filing a claim.

Our primary delinquent inventory was 46,556 loans at December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of 7% from 2016 and 26% from 2015. The reduction in our primary delinquent inventory is the result of the total number of delinquent loans: (1) that have cured; (2) for which claim payments have been made; or (3) that have resulted in rescission, claim denial, or removal from inventory due to settlements of claims paying disputes or commutations of coverage of pools of NPLs, collectively, exceeding the total number of new delinquencies on insured loans. In recent periods, we have experienced improved cure rates and the number of delinquencies in inventory with twelve or more missed payments has been declining. Generally, the fewer missed payments a delinquent loan has the lower the likelihood it will result in a claim. Our commutations of coverage on pools of NPLs have each been completed with amounts paid approximating the loss reserves previously established on the delinquent loans. We expect our delinquent inventory to decline in 2018 from 2017 levels.\nThe primary and pool loss reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 appear in table t.20 below.\nTable 255:

As a result, delinquencies, including in our most recent policy years, were greater than they otherwise would have been.\nThe losses we have incurred on our 2005 through 2008 books have exceeded our premiums from those books. Although uncertainty remains with respect to the ultimate losses we will experience on these books of business, as we continue to write new insurance on high-quality loans, those books are a declining percentage of our total mortgage insurance portfolio. Our 2005 through 2008 books of business represented approximately 19% and 25% of our total primary RIF at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 39% and 38% of the remaining primary RIF on our 2005 through 2008 books of business benefited from HARP as of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nOn our primary business, the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third and fourth year after the year of loan origination. However, the pattern of claims frequency can be affected by many factors, including persistency and deteriorating economic conditions. Low persistency can accelerate the period in the life of a book during which the highest claim frequency occurs. Deteriorating economic conditions can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims.

Underwriting and other expenses includes items such as employee compensation, fees for professional services, depreciation and maintenance expense, and premium taxes, and are reported net of ceding commissions. Underwriting and other expenses for 2017 increased when compared to 2016 primarily due to higher compensation, professional services, and depreciation expenses.\n2016 compared to 2015. Underwriting and other expenses for 2016 decreased when compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in ceding commissions from reinsurers, offset by increases in compensation costs and professional services.\nUnderwriting expense ratio\nThe underwriting expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the underwriting and operating expenses, net and amortization of DAC of our combined insurance operations (which excludes underwriting and operating expenses of our non-insurance operations) to NPW, and is presented in chart c.07 below for the past three years.\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Chart\n</td> <td>c.07\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2017 when compared to 2016 was due to an increase in expenses, offset in part by an increase in our NPW. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in NPW.\nInterest expense\n2017 compared to 2016. Interest expense for 2017 was relatively flat with 2016 as a full-year of interest on our 5.75% Notes issued in August 2016 offset lower interest due to the maturity of our 5% Notes and extinguishment of our 2% Notes.\n2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to MGIC's purchase of a portion of our 9% Debentures and the maturity of our 5.375% Notes. We also repurchased portions of our 5% and 2% Notes at various times during 2016, but we incurred new debt obligations to execute the repurchases thereby offsetting any reductions in interest expense from the repurchases.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment in 2016 reflects the repurchases of a portion of our outstanding 2% and 5% Notes at amounts above our carrying values. The loss on debt extinguishment from MGIC's purchase of a portion of our 9% Debentures represents the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component on the purchase date.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 81\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results of Operations (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rate\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(in millions, except rate)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(684,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effective tax provision (benefit) rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(140.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 compared to 2016. Income tax expense for 2017 increased compared to 2016. The increase was due to a remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, the increase in income before tax, and an additional tax provision recorded for the expected settlement of our IRS litigation. See Note 12 - \"Income taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Tax Act and expected IRS settlement. The difference between our statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax provision rate of 54.7% in 2017 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at the lower corporate tax rate and the additional tax provision recorded for the expected settlement of our IRS litigation. The difference between our statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax provision rate of 33.5% in 2016 was primarily due to the benefits of tax preferenced securities.\n2016 compared to 2015. Income tax expense for 2016 increased compared to 2015. This change is primarily due to the reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance in 2015 and because we were required to establish a full tax provision for 2016. The difference between our statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax provision rate of 33.5% in 2016 was primarily due to the benefits of tax preferenced securities. The difference between our statutory tax rate of 35% and our effective tax (benefit) rate on our pre-tax income of (140.3%) in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the changes in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our tax position.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 82\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>Overview\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Insurance Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated Results of Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Glossary of terms and acronyms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nAssets\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $5,619 million compared to $5,735 million in the prior year.

Against this positive macroeconomic backdrop, which includes very low unemployment, inflation pressures are seen rising. The FOMC, increased its benchmark interest rate 75 basis points during 2017 and its view is the benchmark will increase another 75 basis points in 2018. Our investment portfolio of fixed income securities is subject to interest rate risk and its fair value is likely to decline in a rising interest rate environment. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and volatility by maintaining a diverse mix of high quality securities with an intermediate duration profile. While higher interest rates may adversely impact the fair values of our fixed income securities, they present an opportunity to reinvest investment income and proceeds from security maturities into higher yielding securities. The Tax Act is expected to have implications for allocations of our fixed income securities. All other things equal, the lower corporate income tax rate reduces the benefit of owning tax-exempt fixed income securities, therefore, our overall allocation to these securities may change over time.\nDeferred income taxes\nOur deferred income taxes primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards from operating losses experienced in prior years that we expect will offset taxable income in future periods. During 2017, net deferred tax assets were remeasured to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act. The remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets was a discrete period item that increased our tax provision by $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased our deferred tax asset by a like amount. See Note 12- \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, our deferred tax asset is recorded at $234.4 million.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 84\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Analysis (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther tax matters\nWe continue to have unresolved tax matters primarily related to reviews of our 2000-2007 federal income tax returns by the IRS. We have reached agreement with the IRS on all issues for those years and in the fourth quarter of 2017, the IRS submitted documentation reflecting the terms of the agreement to the JCT for its review, which must be performed before a settlement can be completed. There is no assurance that a settlement will be completed. Our consolidated financial statements reflect our estimates of the tax contingencies discussed more fully in Note 12 - \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements. Based on information we currently have regarding the status of the dispute, we recorded a provision for additional taxes and interest of $29.0 million in 2017.\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nTotal liabilities decreased 23% to $2,465 million as of December 31, 2017 from $3,186 million as of December 31, 2016. Loss reserves, which represent our estimated liability for losses and settlement expenses under our mortgage guaranty insurance policies, net of related reinsurance balances recoverable, decreased 32% to $937 million as of December 31, 2017 from $1,388 million as of December 31, 2016. This decrease was driven by the payment of losses during 2017 and favorable development on delinquencies received in prior years, offset in part by losses incurred on new delinquency notices received in 2017. Unearned premiums increased 19% to $393 million as of December 31, 2017 (2016: $330 million), primarily due to an increase in the amount of NIW from single premium policies. Long-term debt, at carrying value, declined 30% to $830 million as of December 31, 2017 versus $1,179 million as of December 31, 2016 due to the maturity of our 5% Notes and conversion and partial redemption of our 2% Notes. See Note 7 - \"Debt\" for further discussion of these transactions. Other liabilities increased 7% to $256 million as of December 31, 2017 (2016: $238 million), primarily due to increases in our income taxes payable, primarily due to our expected IRS settlement, and in our pension plan benefit obligation, offset in part by declines in our premium refund accrual and other liabilities.\nTotal equity increased 24% to $3,155 million as of December 31, 2017 from $2,549 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase from the prior year was driven by net income generated during 2017 and the conversion of our 2% Notes to shares of our common stock.\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Chart\n</td> <td>c.09\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSTRUCTURE OF BALANCE SHEET\n% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities and equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,619,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,734,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 85\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Sheet Analysis (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBenefit plans\nWe have a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees, as well as a supplemental executive retirement plan. Retirement benefits are based on compensation and years of service. We maintain plan assets to fund our defined benefit pension plan obligations. The supplemental executive retirement plan benefits are accrued for and are paid from MGIC assets following employee retirements. As of December 31, 2017, we have accrued a $6.4 million liability related to our defined benefit pension plan as the projected obligation was in excess of plan assets, while at December 31, 2016, it had plan assets in excess of the projected obligation. Our projected benefit obligations under these plans are subject to numerous actuarial assumptions that may change in the future and as a result could substantially increase or decrease our obligations. Plan assets held to pay our defined benefit pension plan obligations are primarily invested in a portfolio of debt securities to preserve capital and to provide monthly cash flows aligned with the liability component of our obligations, with a lesser percentage invested in a mix of equity securities. If the performance of our invested plan assets differs from our expectations, the funded status of the benefit pension plan may decline, even with no significant change in the obligations.

Premiums are received at the beginning of the coverage period for single premium and annual premium policies. Our largest cash outflow is for claims that arise when a delinquency results in an insured loss. Because the payment of claims occurs after the receipt of the premium, often years later, we invest our claims paying resources in various investment securities that earn interest. We also use cash to pay for our ongoing expenses such as salaries, debt interest, and rent. We also utilize reinsurance to manage the risk we take on our insurance policies. We cede, or pay out, part of the premiums we receive to our reinsurers and collect cash back when losses subject to our reinsurance coverage are paid.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to a lower level of losses paid and an increase in net premiums written, offset in part by increases in payments for interest and other expenses.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to a lower level of losses paid. The increase was offset in part by the commutation of our 2013 QSR Transaction in 2015, which resulted in a return to us of unearned ceded premiums written and settlement of our profit commission accrued during the term of the agreement.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 87\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting activities\nThe following list highlights the major sources and uses of cash flow from investing activities:\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+\n</td> <td>Proceeds from fixed income securities sold, called or matured\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+\n</td> <td>Decreases in restricted cash\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Purchases of fixed income securities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe maintain an investment portfolio that is primarily invested in a diverse mix of fixed income securities.

The focus we place on any individual objective may change over time due to factors that include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, changes at the GSEs, competition, and alternative transactions to transfer mortgage risk.\nCapital Structure\nTable t.29 summarizes our capital structure as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except ratio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Common stock, paid-in capital, retained earnings, less treasury stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,198,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,623,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,297,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,880\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,154,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,548,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,236,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Long-term debt, par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>836,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,189,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,223,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total capital resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,991,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,738,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,459,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ratio of long-term debt to shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal shareholders' equity increased in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to net income during 2017 and conversion of substantially all of our then-remaining 2% Notes into shares of common stock.

The increase in shareholders' equity in 2016 from 2015 was due to net income in 2016, which was offset in part by the cost of repurchasing the shares of common stock issued in connection with the repurchase of a portion of our 2% Notes.\nDebt at our holding company and holding company liquidity\nDebt obligations - holding company\nChart c.10 shows the outstanding principal amount of the debt obligations of our holding company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

These resources are maintained primarily to service our debt interest expense, pay debt maturities, repurchase outstanding debt obligations as opportunities arise, and to settle intercompany obligations. We may also use available holding company cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. While these assets are held, we generate investment income that serves to offset a portion of our interest expense. Investment income and the payment of dividends from our insurance subsidiaries are the principal sources of holding company cash inflow. MGIC is the principal source of dividends, and their payment is restricted by insurance regulation. See Note 14 - \"Statutory Information\" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about MGIC's dividend restrictions. The payment of dividends from MGIC is also influenced by our view of the appropriate level of PMIERs Available Assets to maintain in excess of Minimum Required Assets. Other sources of holding company cash inflow include any unused capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility and raising capital in the public markets. The ability to raise capital in the public markets is subject to prevailing market conditions, investor demand for the securities to be issued, and our deemed creditworthiness.\nOver the next twelve months the principal demand on holding company resources will be interest payments on our 5.75% Notes and 9% Debentures approximating $60 million. We expect MGIC will continue to pay dividends of at least $50 million per quarter in 2018. Our unsecured revolving credit facility provides $175 million of borrowing capacity, of which no amount is currently drawn. We believe our holding company has sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its payment obligations for the foreseeable future.\nIn 2017, our holding company cash and investments decreased by $67 million, to $216 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash outflows included $150 million to repay our 5% Notes at maturity and $67 million of interest payments, of which approximately $12 million was paid to MGIC for the portion of our 9% Debentures owned by MGIC. Cash inflows primarily included $140 million of dividends received from MGIC.\nThe net unrealized losses on our holding company investment portfolio were approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2017 and the portfolio had a modified duration of approximately 1.8 years.\nScheduled debt maturities beyond the next twelve months include $425 million of our 5.75% Notes in 2023 and $389.5 million of our 9% Debentures in 2063, of which MGIC owns $132.7 million. The principal amount of the 9% Debentures is currently convertible, at the holder's option, at an initial conversion rate, which is subject to adjustment, of 74.0741 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $13.50 per share. We may redeem the 9% Debentures in whole or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 9% Debentures being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds $17.55 for at least 20 of the 30 trading days preceding notice of the redemption.\nSee Note 7 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the conversion terms of our 9% Debentures and the terms of our indebtedness, including our option to defer interest. The description in Note 7 - Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the notes and debentures. The terms of our 9% Debentures are contained in the Indenture dated as of March 28, 2008, between us and U.S. Bank National Association filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 12, 2008. The terms of our 5.75% Notes are contained in a Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 5, 2016, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, which is included as an exhibit to our 8-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, and in the Indenture dated as of October 15, 2000 between us and the trustee.\nAlthough not anticipated in the near term, we may also contribute funds to our insurance operations to comply with the PMIERs or the State Capital Requirements. See Overview - Capital\u201d above for a discussion of these requirements. See the discussion of our non-insurance contract underwriting services in Note 17 - Litigation and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for other possible uses of holding company resources.\nWe may from time to time acquire our debt obligations through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities. We may also from time to time acquire our common stock through cash purchases, including with\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 91\nTable 298: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nfunds provided by debt. We may make such acquisitions in open market purchases, privately negotiated acquisitions or other transactions. The amounts involved may be material.\nDebt at subsidiaries\nMGIC is a member of the FHLB. Membership in the FHLB provides MGIC access to an additional source of liquidity via a secured lending facility. MGIC has $155.0 million in the form of a fixed rate advance from the FHLB outstanding. Interest on the Advance is payable monthly at an annual rate, fixed for the term of the Advance, of 1.91%. The principal of the Advance matures on February 10, 2023. MGIC may prepay the Advance at any time. Such prepayment would be below par if interest rates have risen after the Advance was originated, or above par if interest rates have declined. The Advance is secured by eligible collateral in the form of pledged securities from the investment portfolio, whose market value must be maintained at 102% of the principal balance of the Advance.\nCapital Adequacy\nPMIERs\nWe operate under the PMIERs of the GSEs that became effective December 31, 2015. The PMIERS were most recently revised in December 2016, but the revision had no impact on our calculation of Available Assets or Minimum Required Assets, or on our operations. Refer to \"Overview - Capital - GSEs\" of this MD&A for further discussion of PMIERs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, MGIC's Available Assets under PMIERs totaled approximately $4.8 billion, an excess of approximately $0.8 billion over its Minimum Required Assets; and MGIC is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. Maintaining a sufficient level of excess Available Assets will allow MGIC to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements, including, we believe, to the extent they are revised. Our QSR Transactions provided an aggregate of approximately $0.8 billion of PMIERs capital credit as of December 31, 2017. Our 2018 QSR transaction terms are expected to be no less favorable than our 2017 and 2015 QSR transactions and will also provide PMIERs capital credit. Refer to Note 9 - \"Reinsurance\" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our QSR transactions.\nWe plan to continuously comply with the PMIERs through our operational activities or through the contribution of funds from our holding company, subject to demands on the holding company's resources, as outlined above.\nRisk-to-capital\nWe compute our risk-to-capital ratio on a separate company statutory basis, as well as on a combined insurance operations basis. The risk-to-capital ratio is our net RIF divided by our policyholders' position. Our net RIF includes both primary and pool RIF, and excludes risk on policies that are currently in default and for which loss reserves have been established and those covered by reinsurance. The risk amount includes pools of loans with contractual aggregate loss limits and without these limits. Policyholders' position consists primarily of statutory policyholders' surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve and a portion of the reserves for unearned premiums. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. A mortgage insurance company is required to make annual additions to a contingency reserve of approximately 50% of net earned premiums. These contributions must generally be maintained for a period of ten years. However, with regulatory approval a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35% of net earned premiums in a calendar year.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 92\nTable 299: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable t.30 below presents MGIC's separate company risk-to-capital calculation.\nTable 300: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-to-capital - MGIC separate company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except ratio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIF - net (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Statutory policyholders' surplus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Statutory contingency reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Statutory policyholders' position\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Risk-to-capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>RIF - net, as shown in the table above, is net of reinsurance and exposure on policies currently in default and for which loss reserves have been established.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable t.31 below presents our combined insurance companies' risk-to-capital calculation (which includes a reinsurance affiliate).

Our operating lease obligations include operating leases on certain office space, data processing equipment and autos, as discussed in Note 16 - Leases\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. Tax obligations consist primarily of amounts related to our current dispute with the IRS, as discussed in Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. Purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase items related to our ongoing infrastructure projects and information technology investments in the normal course of business. See Note 11 - Benefit Plans\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of expected benefit payments under our benefit plans.\nOur other long-term liabilities represent the loss reserves established to recognize the liability for losses and LAE related to existing defaults on insured mortgage loans. The timing of the future claim payments associated with the established loss reserves was determined primarily based on two key assumptions: the length of time it takes for a notice of delinquency to develop into a received claim and the length of time it takes for a received claim to be ultimately paid. The future claim payment periods are estimated based on historical experience, and could emerge differently than this estimate, in part, due to uncertainty regarding how certain factors, such as loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and changes in some state foreclosure laws that may include, for example, a requirement for additional review and/or mediation process.\nSee Note 8 - Loss Reserves\u201d to our consolidated financial statements and Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below for additional information on our loss reserves. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, we establish loss reserves only for delinquent loans. Because our reserving method does not take account of the impact of future losses that could occur from loans that are not delinquent, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to occur under our policies in force at any period end is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements or in the table above.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 94\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>Overview\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Mortgage Insurance Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated Results of Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance Sheet Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Glossary of terms and acronyms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies described below require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nLoss reserves\nReserves are established for reported insurance losses and LAE based on when notices of delinquency on insured mortgage loans are received. For reporting purposes, we consider a loan delinquent when it is two or more payments past due. Even though the accounting standard, ASC 944, regarding accounting and reporting by insurance entities specifically excluded mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to loss reserves, we establish loss reserves using the general principles contained in the insurance standard. However, consistent with industry standards for mortgage insurers, we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently delinquent.\nWe establish reserves using estimated claim rates and claim severities in estimating the ultimate loss.\nThe estimated claim rates and claim severities represent what we estimate will actually be paid on the delinquent loans as of the reserve date. If a policy is rescinded we do not expect that it will result in a claim payment and thus the rescission generally reduces the historical claim rate used in establishing reserves. In addition, if a loan cures its delinquency, including successful loan modifications that result in a cure being reported to us, the cure reduces the historical claim rate used in establishing reserves. Our methodology to estimate claim rates and claim amounts is based on our review of recent trends in the delinquent inventory. To establish reserves we utilize a reserving model that continually incorporates historical data into the estimated claim rate. The model also incorporates an estimate for the amount of the claim we will pay, or severity. The severity is estimated using the historical percentage of our claim paid compared to our loan exposure, as well as the RIF of the loans currently in default. We do not utilize an explicit rescission rate in our reserving methodology, but rather our reserving methodology incorporates the effects rescission activity has had on our historical claim rate and claim severities. We review recent trends in the claim rate, severity, levels of defaults by geography and average loan exposure. As a result, the process to determine reserves does not include quantitative ranges of outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur.\nThe claim rates and claim severities are affected by external events, including actual economic conditions such as changes in unemployment rate, interest rate or housing values; and natural disasters. Our estimation process does not include a correlation between claim rates and claim amounts to projected economic conditions such as changes in unemployment rate, interest rate or housing values. Our experience is that analysis of that nature would not produce reliable results as the change in one economic condition cannot be isolated to determine its sole effect on our ultimate paid losses because it is also influenced by other economic conditions at the same time. Additionally, the changes and interaction of these economic conditions are not likely homogeneous throughout the regions in which we conduct business. Each economic environment influences our ultimate paid losses differently, even if apparently similar in nature. Furthermore, changes in economic conditions may not necessarily be reflected in our loss development in the quarter or year in which the changes occur. Actual claim results often lag changes in economic conditions by at least nine to twelve months.\nOur estimates are also affected by any agreements we enter into regarding our claims paying practices, such as the settlement agreements discussed in Note 17 - Litigation and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our estimate of loss reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in our estimated claim rate or severity could have a material impact on reserves and, correspondingly, on our consolidated results of operations even in a stable economic environment. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, a $1,000 increase/decrease in the average severity reserve factor would change the reserve amount by approximately +/- $18 million. A 1 percentage point increase/decrease in the average claim rate reserve factor would change the reserve amount by approximately +/- $26 million as of December 31, 2017.

Consistent with reserves for reported defaults, IBNR reserves are established using estimated claim rates and claim severities for the estimated number of delinquencies not reported. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had IBNR reserves of approximately $35 million and $54 million, respectively.\nThe actual amount of the claim payments may be substantially different than our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions, including unemployment, leading to a reduction in borrower income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, and a drop in housing values, that could result in, among other things, greater losses on loans, and may affect borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below the mortgage balance.\nLAE\nReserves are also established for the estimated costs of settling claims, including legal and other expenses and general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nRevenue recognition\nWhen a policy term ends, the primary mortgage insurance written by us is renewable at the insured's option through continued payment of the premium in accordance with the schedule established at the inception of the policy life. We have no ability to reunderwrite or reprice these policies after issuance. Premiums written under policies having single and annual premium payments are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy life. Premiums written on policies covering more than one year are amortized over the policy life in relationship to the anticipated incurred loss pattern based on historical experience. Premiums written on annual policies are earned on a monthly pro rata basis. Premiums written on monthly policies are earned as the monthly coverage is provided. When a policy is cancelled, all premium that is non-refundable is immediately earned. Any refundable premium is returned to the servicer or borrower. Policies may be cancelled by the insured, or due to rescissions or claim payment. When a policy is rescinded, all previously collected premium is returned to the servicer and when a claim is paid, all premium collected since the date of default is returned. The liability associated with our estimate of premium to be returned is accrued for separately and this liability is included in Other liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in these liabilities and the actual return of premium affect premiums written and earned.\nFee income of our non-insurance subsidiaries is earned and recognized as the services are provided and the customer is obligated to pay.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 96\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Policies (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred insurance policy acquisition costs\nCosts directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance business, consisting of employee compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as deferred insurance policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\"). The deferred costs are net of any ceding commissions received associated with our reinsurance agreements. For each underwriting year of business, these costs are amortized to income in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies. We utilize anticipated investment income in our calculation. This includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of DAC. The estimates for each underwriting year are reviewed quarterly and updated when necessary to reflect actual experience and any changes to key variables such as persistency or loss development.\nBecause our insurance premiums are earned over time, changes in persistency result in DAC being amortized against revenue over a longer or shorter period of time. However, even a 10% change in persistency would not have a material effect on the amortization of DAC in the subsequent year.\nFair value measurements\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur entire investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale and is reported at fair value or, for certain equity securities carried at cost, amounts that approximate fair value. The related unrealized investment gains or losses are, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Realized investment gains and losses on investments are recognized in income based upon specific identification of securities sold.\nTo determine the fair value of securities available-for-sale in Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, independent pricing sources have been utilized. One price is provided per security based on observable market data. To ensure securities are appropriately classified in the fair value hierarchy, we review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing sources and believe that their policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the issue valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded. A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including data published in market research publications. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation.\nMarket indicators, industry and economic events are also considered. This information is evaluated using a multidimensional pricing model. This model combines all inputs to arrive at a value assigned to each security. Quality controls are performed by the independent pricing sources throughout this process, which include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information, data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. In addition, on a quarterly basis, we perform quality controls over values received from the pricing sources which also include reviewing tolerance reports, trading information, data changes, and directional moves compared to market moves. We have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from the independent pricing sources.\nIn accordance with fair value guidance, we applied the following fair value hierarchy in order to measure fair value for assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that we can access. Financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs primarily include U.S. Treasury securities and certain equity securities.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable in the marketplace for the financial instrument. The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value of the financial instruments. Financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs primarily include obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain municipal bonds.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 97\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Policies (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe independent pricing sources used for our Level 2 investments vary by type of investment See Note 3 - \"Significant Accounting Policies\" for further information on the independent pricing sources used.\nLevel 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable, or for certain equity securities, from their par value due to restrictions that require them to be redeemed or sold only to the security issuer at par value. The inputs used to derive the fair value of Level 3 securities reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. Our non-financial assets that are classified as Level 3 securities consist of real estate acquired through claim settlement. The fair value of real estate acquired is the lower of our acquisition cost or a percentage of the appraised value. The percentage applied to the appraised value is based upon our historical sales experience adjusted for current trends.\nUnrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\")\nEach quarter we perform reviews of our investments in order to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost were considered other-than-temporary. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to:\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>the present value of the discounted cash flows we expect to collect compared to the amortized cost basis of the security;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>extent and duration of the decline;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>change in rating below investment grade; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25aa\n</td> <td>adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our evaluation, we will record an OTTI adjustment on a security if we intend to sell the impaired security, if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, or if the present value of the discounted cash flows we expect to collect is less than the amortized costs basis of the security. If the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost at the time of our intent to sell, the security is classified as other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations. Otherwise, when a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the losses are separated into the portion of the loss that represents the credit loss; and the portion that is due to other factors. The credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations, while the loss due to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. A credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of the discounted cash flows, using the security's original yield, expected to be collected from the security is less than the cost basis of the security.\nFair Value Option\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments acquired, or issued, such as our outstanding debt obligations, for which the primary basis of accounting is not fair value.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 98\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlossary of terms and acronyms", "summary": "The report provides the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for MGIC Investment Corporation.

Hence, this Overview is qualified by the information that appears elsewhere in this Annual Report, including the other portions of the MD&A.\nThrough our subsidiary, MGIC, we are a leading provider of PMI in the United States, as measured by $194.9 billion of primary IIF on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2017.\n\n (1) See \"Explanation and Reconciliation of our use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \nSummary of 2017 financial results\nNet income of $355.8 million for 2017 increased by $13.2 million when compared to the prior year, driven by lower losses incurred, net and the absence of significant losses on debt extinguishment in the current year, partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes discussed below. Diluted income per share of $0.95 increased by 10% when compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted net operating income of $517.7 million for 2017 (2016: $396.3 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share of $1.36 (2016: $0.99) each increased from the prior year primarily due to lower losses incurred, net.\nLosses incurred, net were $53.7 million, down 78% as the estimated claim rate on new delinquent notices declined and we experienced higher favorable reserve development on prior year delinquencies when compared to the prior year. New delinquent notices in 2017 increased slightly compared to the prior year due to hurricane activity in the third quarter of 2017, however the estimated claim rate on new notices was approximately 10%, down from approximately 12.5% in the prior year. Our estimated claim rate on new notices primarily reflects improved cure activity due to the current economic environment, but also reflects a materially lower estimated claim rate on our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes. When excluding our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes, our new notice claim rate was approximately 10.5%.\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded during 2016 reflects the repurchases of a portion of our outstanding 2% and 5% Notes at amounts above our carrying values. The loss on debt extinguishment also reflects MGIC's purchase of a portion of our 9% Debentures for which a loss was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component on the purchase date. See Note 7 - \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for these transactions.\nThe increase in our provision for income taxes in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, the increase in income before tax, and an additional tax provision recorded for the expected settlement of our IRS\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 54\n\nlitigation. See Note 12 - \"Income taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Tax Act and expected IRS settlement.\nDuring 2017, MGIC paid $140 million in dividends to our holding company.\nBusiness environment\nCurrent U.S. economic conditions continue to support favorable housing fundamentals, such as low unemployment, household formations, and appreciating home values. Given the supply and demand dynamics of the current market, home prices are expected to further appreciate in 2018. Home price appreciation can have a dampening effect on home purchase activity as it reduces affordability for some borrowers, conversely it may increase the demand for mortgage insurance and/or amount of mortgage insurance due to decreased ability of borrowers to fund a similar down payment percentage absent the appreciation. This recent period of favorable housing fundamentals, coupled with, in our view, high lending standards, has provided a favorable credit backdrop for the business we have written in recent years. In that regard, we have experienced a declining delinquent inventory and lower losses and claims paid. Our most recent book years continue to experience a low level of losses.\nThe 10 year (and other) U.S. Treasury benchmark interest rates have increased in recent quarters and mortgage interest rates in response have been, on average, higher during 2017 compared to the historically low rates of 2016. The gradual increase in mortgage interest rates benefited our business in 2017 as persistency increased, while not materially impacting affordability for first-time homebuyers. Further increases in mortgage rates may impact affordability, which could slow housing activity. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates.\nThe private mortgage insurance industry remains intensely competitive and, in some instances, companies have lower premium rates to protect or grow market share. PMI also competes against government mortgage insurance programs such as the FHA, VA, and USDA, primarily for lower FICO score business. The market share of primary mortgage insurance written by government programs continued to exceed that written by PMI in 2017, however PMI recaptured share from those programs due to writing a higher percentage of purchase originations when compared to government programs. Generally, PMI industry share is 3-4 times higher for purchase originations than refinance originations. Amongst private mortgage insurers, our market share increased slightly from the prior year to 18.3% (source: Inside Mortgage Finance).\nRefer to Mortgage Insurance Portfolio for additional discussion of the 2017 business environment and the impact it had on operating measures including NIW, IIF and RIF.\nSince December 31, 2015 we have operated under the requirements of the PMIERs of the GSEs in order to insure loans purchased by them. The PMIERs include financial requirements that require an approved mortgage insurer to have Available Assets that meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC's Available Assets under PMIERs totaled $4.8 billion, an excess of $0.8 billion over its Minimum Required Assets at December 31, 2017.\nA summary of GSE-recommended PMIERs revisions were issued to us late in the fourth quarter of 2017. Refer to \"Capital - GSEs\" below for a discussion of the impact such revisions are expected to have on our excess Available Assets at their effective date, which is expected to be no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBusiness outlook for 2018\nOur outlook for 2018 should be viewed against the backdrop of the business environment discussed above.\nNIW. Our NIW is affected by total mortgage originations, the percentage of total mortgage originations utilizing private mortgage insurance (the \"PMI penetration rate\") and our market share within the PMI industry. As of late January 2018, total mortgage originations are forecasted to decline in 2018 from 2017 levels due to declines in refinancing originations more than offsetting a slight increase in purchase originations. We expect the PMI penetration rate to increase because historically PMI has captured a share of purchase originations, which are forecast to be a higher percentage of total originations, that is estimated to be 3-4 times greater\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 55\n\nthan that of refinancing originations. Similar to 2017, an increase in the PMI penetration rate should serve to mitigate the decline in total mortgage originations. Although our expectation is for our 2018 NIW to increase slightly from 2017, this will be highly dependent on the actual size of the mortgage origination market, the mix of originations, and competition.\nImpact of tax reform. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Act was enacted that, among other things, reduced federal income tax rates on corporations and eliminated the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\"AMT\"). The reduction in the corporate income tax rate will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 and we expect it to be approximately 21%, compared to approximately 34% when excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement in 2017. In recent years, we have utilized NOLs to reduce our taxes payable, however we were subject to paying taxes under the AMT. The elimination of the corporate AMT eliminates any cash taxes that would have been paid in 2018. We do not expect the changes to individual income taxes included in the Tax Act to materially impact our business.\nIIF and RIF. Our book of IIF is the main driver of our revenues and earnings and its growth is driven by our ability to generate NIW and retain existing policies in force, as measured by our persistency. Interest rates influence both our NIW and persistency. In a rising rate environment, we expect cancellation rates to decline, and in turn increase persistency, although the impact generally lags the change in interest rates. Higher interest rates could reduce affordability for borrowers, which could slow housing activity, and of particular importance to our industry, slow first-time home buyer purchase activity, resulting in less NIW. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates. We expect our IIF will continue to grow in 2018 due to the level of NIW we expect to write in 2018 and our expected persistency.\nResults of operations. We expect our earned premiums growth rate in 2018 to be comparable to that experienced in 2017. The headwinds that have limited earned premium growth in recent years, even with a larger book of IIF, are expected to persist to a certain extent in 2018. Our premium yield is expected to decline in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to changing premium rates, as more fully discussed along with other factors in our \"Consolidated Results of Operations - Premium yield.\" However, we expect increasing IIF to counteract the effect on earned premium of a lower premium yield.\nIn addition to more earned premiums, our revenues are expected to include higher investment income in 2018 due to the increasing size of our investment portfolio, combined with higher average investment yields. We expect 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in the current year (2018) to be lower than the comparable amount for 2017 as we expect to receive fewer new delinquent notices in 2018. We cannot predict the amount, if any, of 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in prior years. The Tax Act will reduce our effective tax rate to approximately 21%, which will reduce the provision for income tax we record against any income before tax. Excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been approximately 34%.\nPMIERs. In December 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. We expect the revised PMIERs to be finalized in 2018 and effective no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018. See \"Capital - GSEs\" below for our discussion of the proposed changes we have received.\nCapital\nGSEs\nWe must comply with the PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In addition to their financial requirements, the PMIERs include business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our NIW. Factors that may negatively impact MGIC's ability to continue to comply with the financial requirements of PMIERs include the following:\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 56\n\n \u2022 On December 18, 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. Once the PMIERs are finalized, we expect a six-month implementation period before the revised PMIERs are effective. We expect that effectiveness will not be earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018. \nIf the GSE-recommended changes are adopted with an effective date in the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that at the effective date, MGIC would continue to have an excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets, although this excess would be materially lower than it was at December 31, 2017 under the existing PMIERs, and that MGIC would continue to be able to pay quarterly dividends to our holding company at the $50 million quarterly rate at which they were paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we expect cash at our holding company at December 31, 2018 would increase over what it was at December 31, 2017.\nWe have non-disclosure obligations to each of the GSEs and cannot provide further comment on the specific provisions of the GSE-recommended changes other than as described above. Until the GSEs and/or FHFA provide public disclosure of proposed or final changes to the existing PMIERs, we do not plan to update or correct any of the disclosure above or provide any additional disclosure regarding any modifications that may occur in the GSE-recommended changes to PMIERs.\n \u2022 Our future operating results may be negatively impacted by the matters discussed in our risk factors. Such matters could decrease our revenues, increase our losses or require the use of assets, thereby creating a shortfall in Available Assets. \n \u2022 Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources, including for repayment of debt.  While on an overall basis, the amount of Available Assets MGIC must hold in order to continue to insure GSE loans increased under the PMIERs over what state regulation currently requires, our reinsurance transactions mitigate the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns.\nState Regulations\nThe insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements.\u201d While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires an MPP.\nAt December 31, 2017, MGIC's risk-to-capital ratio was 9.5 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was $2.1 billion above the required MPP of $1.2 billion. In calculating our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP, we are allowed full credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded to the reinsurers. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transaction, without penalty. At this time, we expect MGIC to continue to comply with the current State Capital Requirements; however, you should read our risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect such compliance.\nAt December 31, 2017, the risk-to-capital ratio of our combined insurance operations (which includes a reinsurance affiliate) was 10.5 to 1. Reinsurance transactions with our affiliate permit MGIC to write insurance with a higher coverage percentage than it could on its own under certain state-specific requirements.\nThe NAIC plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators has been considering since 2016 a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 57\n\ninsurers, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to the capital requirements and certain items have not yet been completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk, minimum capital floors, and action level triggers. Currently we believe that the PMIERs contain the more restrictive capital requirements in most circumstances.\nGSE reform\nThe FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. In the past, members of Congress have introduced several bills intended to change the business practices of the GSEs and the FHA; however, no legislation has been enacted. The Administration has indicated that the conservatorship of the GSEs should end; however, it is unclear whether and when that would occur and how that would impact us. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including PMI, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last.\nFor additional information about the business practices of the GSEs, see our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses\u201d in Item 1A.\nLoan modifications and other similar programs\nThe federal government, including through the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the GSEs, and several lenders have modification and refinance programs to make outstanding loans more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. These programs included HAMP, which expired at the end of 2016, and HARP, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2018. The GSEs have introduced other loan modifications programs to replace HAMP.\nFrom 2008 through 2012, we were notified of modifications that cured delinquencies that, had they become paid claims, would have resulted in a material increase in our incurred losses. More recently, the number of modifications has decreased significantly. Nearly all of the reported loan modifications were for loans insured in 2009 and prior.\nWe cannot determine the total benefit we may derive from loan modification programs, particularly given the uncertainty around the re-default rates for defaulted loans that have been modified. Our loss reserves do not account for potential re-defaults of current loans.\nTable t.01 shows the percentage of our primary RIF that has been modified as of December 31, 2017.\n\n (1) Includes proprietary programs that are substantially the same as HARP. \nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 58\n\nApproximately 15.5% of our total primary RIF has been modified as of December 31, 2017. Based on loan count at December 31, 2017, the loans associated with 96.8% of all HARP modifications and 75.6% of HAMP and other modifications were current.\nFactors affecting our results\nOur results of operations are affected by:\nPremiums written and earned\nPremiums written and earned in a year are influenced by:\n \u2022 NIW, which increases IIF. Many factors affect NIW, including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages from the FHA, the VA, other mortgage insurers, GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance and other alternatives to mortgage insurance. NIW does not include loans previously insured by us that are modified, such as loans modified under HARP. \n \u2022 Cancellations, which reduce IIF. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book, current home values compared to values when the loans in the in force book were insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. Home price appreciation can give homeowners the right to cancel mortgage insurance on their loans if sufficient home equity is achieved. Cancellations also result from policy rescissions, which require us to return any premiums received on the rescinded policies, and claim payments, which require us to return any premium received on the related policies from the date of default on the insured loans. Cancellations of single premium policies, which are generally non-refundable, result in immediate recognition of any remaining unearned premium. \n \u2022 Premium rates, which are affected by product type, competitive pressures, the risk characteristics of the insured loans and the percentage of coverage on the insured loans. The substantial majority of our monthly and annual mortgage insurance premiums are under premium plans for which, for the first ten years of the policy, the amount of premium is determined by multiplying the initial premium rate by the original loan balance; thereafter, the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. However, for loans that have utilized HARP, the initial ten-year period resets as of the date of the HARP transaction. The remainder of our monthly and annual premiums are under premium plans for which premiums are determined by a fixed percentage of the loan's amortizing balance over the life of the policy. \n \u2022 Premiums ceded, net of a profit commission, under reinsurance agreements. See Note 9 - Reinsurance\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance agreements. \nPremiums are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period. A change in the average IIF in the current period compared to an earlier period is a factor that will increase (when the average in force is higher) or reduce (when it is lower) premiums written and earned in the current period, although this effect may be enhanced (or mitigated) by differences in the average premium rate between the two periods, as well as by premiums that are returned or expected to be returned in connection with claim payments and rescissions, and premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements. Also, NIW and cancellations during a period will generally have a greater effect on premiums written and earned in subsequent periods than in the period in which these events occur.\nInvestment income\nOur investment portfolio is composed principally of investment grade fixed income securities. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of the investment portfolio is mainly a function of cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as NPW, investment income, net claim payments and expenses, and cash provided by (or used for) non-operating activities, such as debt or stock issuances or repurchases.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 59\n\nLosses incurred\nLosses incurred are the current expense that reflects estimated payments that will ultimately be made as a result of delinquencies on insured loans. As explained under Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below, we recognize an estimate of this expense only for delinquent loans. The level of new delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern, with new delinquencies in the first part of the year lower than new delinquencies in the latter part of the year, though this pattern can be affected by the state of the economy and local housing markets. Losses incurred are generally affected by:\n \u2022 The state of the economy, including unemployment and housing values, each of which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency. \n \u2022 The product mix of the in force book, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims. \n \u2022 The size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase losses incurred.

Diluted income per share of $0.95 increased by 10% when compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted net operating income of $517.7 million for 2017 (2016: $396.3 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share of $1.36 (2016: $0.99) each increased from the prior year primarily due to lower losses incurred, net.\nLosses incurred, net were $53.7 million, down 78% as the estimated claim rate on new delinquent notices declined and we experienced higher favorable reserve development on prior year delinquencies when compared to the prior year. New delinquent notices in 2017 increased slightly compared to the prior year due to hurricane activity in the third quarter of 2017, however the estimated claim rate on new notices was approximately 10%, down from approximately 12.5% in the prior year. Our estimated claim rate on new notices primarily reflects improved cure activity due to the current economic environment, but also reflects a materially lower estimated claim rate on our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes. When excluding our estimate of new notices caused by hurricanes, our new notice claim rate was approximately 10.5%.\nThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded during 2016 reflects the repurchases of a portion of our outstanding 2% and 5% Notes at amounts above our carrying values. The loss on debt extinguishment also reflects MGIC's purchase of a portion of our 9% Debentures for which a loss was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component on the purchase date. See Note 7 - \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for these transactions.\nThe increase in our provision for income taxes in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act, the increase in income before tax, and an additional tax provision recorded for the expected settlement of our IRS\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 54\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nlitigation.

Given the supply and demand dynamics of the current market, home prices are expected to further appreciate in 2018. Home price appreciation can have a dampening effect on home purchase activity as it reduces affordability for some borrowers, conversely it may increase the demand for mortgage insurance and/or amount of mortgage insurance due to decreased ability of borrowers to fund a similar down payment percentage absent the appreciation. This recent period of favorable housing fundamentals, coupled with, in our view, high lending standards, has provided a favorable credit backdrop for the business we have written in recent years. In that regard, we have experienced a declining delinquent inventory and lower losses and claims paid. Our most recent book years continue to experience a low level of losses.\nThe 10 year (and other) U.S. Treasury benchmark interest rates have increased in recent quarters and mortgage interest rates in response have been, on average, higher during 2017 compared to the historically low rates of 2016. The gradual increase in mortgage interest rates benefited our business in 2017 as persistency increased, while not materially impacting affordability for first-time homebuyers. Further increases in mortgage rates may impact affordability, which could slow housing activity. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates.\nThe private mortgage insurance industry remains intensely competitive and, in some instances, companies have lower premium rates to protect or grow market share. PMI also competes against government mortgage insurance programs such as the FHA, VA, and USDA, primarily for lower FICO score business. The market share of primary mortgage insurance written by government programs continued to exceed that written by PMI in 2017, however PMI recaptured share from those programs due to writing a higher percentage of purchase originations when compared to government programs. Generally, PMI industry share is 3-4 times higher for purchase originations than refinance originations. Amongst private mortgage insurers, our market share increased slightly from the prior year to 18.3% (source: Inside Mortgage Finance).\nRefer to Mortgage Insurance Portfolio for additional discussion of the 2017 business environment and the impact it had on operating measures including NIW, IIF and RIF.\nSince December 31, 2015 we have operated under the requirements of the PMIERs of the GSEs in order to insure loans purchased by them. The PMIERs include financial requirements that require an approved mortgage insurer to have Available Assets that meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC's Available Assets under PMIERs totaled $4.8 billion, an excess of $0.8 billion over its Minimum Required Assets at December 31, 2017.\nA summary of GSE-recommended PMIERs revisions were issued to us late in the fourth quarter of 2017. Refer to \"Capital - GSEs\" below for a discussion of the impact such revisions are expected to have on our excess Available Assets at their effective date, which is expected to be no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBusiness outlook for 2018\nOur outlook for 2018 should be viewed against the backdrop of the business environment discussed above.\nNIW. Our NIW is affected by total mortgage originations, the percentage of total mortgage originations utilizing private mortgage insurance (the \"PMI penetration rate\") and our market share within the PMI industry. As of late January 2018, total mortgage originations are forecasted to decline in 2018 from 2017 levels due to declines in refinancing originations more than offsetting a slight increase in purchase originations. We expect the PMI penetration rate to increase because historically PMI has captured a share of purchase originations, which are forecast to be a higher percentage of total originations, that is estimated to be 3-4 times greater\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 55\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthan that of refinancing originations. Similar to 2017, an increase in the PMI penetration rate should serve to mitigate the decline in total mortgage originations. Although our expectation is for our 2018 NIW to increase slightly from 2017, this will be highly dependent on the actual size of the mortgage origination market, the mix of originations, and competition.\nImpact of tax reform. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Act was enacted that, among other things, reduced federal income tax rates on corporations and eliminated the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\"AMT\"). The reduction in the corporate income tax rate will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 and we expect it to be approximately 21%, compared to approximately 34% when excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement in 2017. In recent years, we have utilized NOLs to reduce our taxes payable, however we were subject to paying taxes under the AMT. The elimination of the corporate AMT eliminates any cash taxes that would have been paid in 2018. We do not expect the changes to individual income taxes included in the Tax Act to materially impact our business.\nIIF and RIF. Our book of IIF is the main driver of our revenues and earnings and its growth is driven by our ability to generate NIW and retain existing policies in force, as measured by our persistency. Interest rates influence both our NIW and persistency. In a rising rate environment, we expect cancellation rates to decline, and in turn increase persistency, although the impact generally lags the change in interest rates. Higher interest rates could reduce affordability for borrowers, which could slow housing activity, and of particular importance to our industry, slow first-time home buyer purchase activity, resulting in less NIW. Historically however, purchase origination volume has been impacted more by the level and direction of consumer confidence than by changes in interest rates. We expect our IIF will continue to grow in 2018 due to the level of NIW we expect to write in 2018 and our expected persistency.\nResults of operations. We expect our earned premiums growth rate in 2018 to be comparable to that experienced in 2017. The headwinds that have limited earned premium growth in recent years, even with a larger book of IIF, are expected to persist to a certain extent in 2018. Our premium yield is expected to decline in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to changing premium rates, as more fully discussed along with other factors in our \"Consolidated Results of Operations - Premium yield.\" However, we expect increasing IIF to counteract the effect on earned premium of a lower premium yield.\nIn addition to more earned premiums, our revenues are expected to include higher investment income in 2018 due to the increasing size of our investment portfolio, combined with higher average investment yields. We expect 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in the current year (2018) to be lower than the comparable amount for 2017 as we expect to receive fewer new delinquent notices in 2018. We cannot predict the amount, if any, of 2018 losses incurred with respect to delinquent notices received in prior years. The Tax Act will reduce our effective tax rate to approximately 21%, which will reduce the provision for income tax we record against any income before tax. Excluding the impact of remeasuring our net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Act and the additional provision recorded for our expected IRS settlement, our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been approximately 34%.\nPMIERs. In December 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. We expect the revised PMIERs to be finalized in 2018 and effective no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018. See \"Capital - GSEs\" below for our discussion of the proposed changes we have received.\nCapital\nGSEs\nWe must comply with the PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In addition to their financial requirements, the PMIERs include business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our NIW. Factors that may negatively impact MGIC's ability to continue to comply with the financial requirements of PMIERs include the following:\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 56\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 On December 18, 2017, we received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs that are being recommended to the FHFA by the GSEs. Once the PMIERs are finalized, we expect a six-month implementation period before the revised PMIERs are effective. We expect that effectiveness will not be earlier than the fourth quarter of 2018. \nIf the GSE-recommended changes are adopted with an effective date in the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that at the effective date, MGIC would continue to have an excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets, although this excess would be materially lower than it was at December 31, 2017 under the existing PMIERs, and that MGIC would continue to be able to pay quarterly dividends to our holding company at the $50 million quarterly rate at which they were paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we expect cash at our holding company at December 31, 2018 would increase over what it was at December 31, 2017.\nWe have non-disclosure obligations to each of the GSEs and cannot provide further comment on the specific provisions of the GSE-recommended changes other than as described above. Until the GSEs and/or FHFA provide public disclosure of proposed or final changes to the existing PMIERs, we do not plan to update or correct any of the disclosure above or provide any additional disclosure regarding any modifications that may occur in the GSE-recommended changes to PMIERs.\n \u2022 Our future operating results may be negatively impacted by the matters discussed in our risk factors. Such matters could decrease our revenues, increase our losses or require the use of assets, thereby creating a shortfall in Available Assets. \n \u2022 Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources, including for repayment of debt.  While on an overall basis, the amount of Available Assets MGIC must hold in order to continue to insure GSE loans increased under the PMIERs over what state regulation currently requires, our reinsurance transactions mitigate the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns.\nState Regulations\nThe insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements.\u201d While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires an MPP.\nAt December 31, 2017, MGIC's risk-to-capital ratio was 9.5 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was $2.1 billion above the required MPP of $1.2 billion. In calculating our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP, we are allowed full credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded to the reinsurers. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transaction, without penalty. At this time, we expect MGIC to continue to comply with the current State Capital Requirements; however, you should read our risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect such compliance.\nAt December 31, 2017, the risk-to-capital ratio of our combined insurance operations (which includes a reinsurance affiliate) was 10.5 to 1. Reinsurance transactions with our affiliate permit MGIC to write insurance with a higher coverage percentage than it could on its own under certain state-specific requirements.\nThe NAIC plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators has been considering since 2016 a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 57\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ninsurers, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to the capital requirements and certain items have not yet been completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk, minimum capital floors, and action level triggers. Currently we believe that the PMIERs contain the more restrictive capital requirements in most circumstances.\nGSE reform\nThe FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. In the past, members of Congress have introduced several bills intended to change the business practices of the GSEs and the FHA; however, no legislation has been enacted. The Administration has indicated that the conservatorship of the GSEs should end; however, it is unclear whether and when that would occur and how that would impact us. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including PMI, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last.\nFor additional information about the business practices of the GSEs, see our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses\u201d in Item 1A.\nLoan modifications and other similar programs\nThe federal government, including through the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the GSEs, and several lenders have modification and refinance programs to make outstanding loans more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. These programs included HAMP, which expired at the end of 2016, and HARP, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2018. The GSEs have introduced other loan modifications programs to replace HAMP.\nFrom 2008 through 2012, we were notified of modifications that cured delinquencies that, had they become paid claims, would have resulted in a material increase in our incurred losses. More recently, the number of modifications has decreased significantly. Nearly all of the reported loan modifications were for loans insured in 2009 and prior.\nWe cannot determine the total benefit we may derive from loan modification programs, particularly given the uncertainty around the re-default rates for defaulted loans that have been modified. Our loss reserves do not account for potential re-defaults of current loans.\nTable t.01 shows the percentage of our primary RIF that has been modified as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Table\n</td> <td>t.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modifications\n</td> <td>Policy Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>HARP (1)\nModifications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>HAMP & Other Modifications\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2003 and Prior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2010 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes proprietary programs that are substantially the same as HARP. \nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 58\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately 15.5% of our total primary RIF has been modified as of December 31, 2017. Based on loan count at December 31, 2017, the loans associated with 96.8% of all HARP modifications and 75.6% of HAMP and other modifications were current.\nFactors affecting our results\nOur results of operations are affected by:\nPremiums written and earned\nPremiums written and earned in a year are influenced by:\n \u2022 NIW, which increases IIF. Many factors affect NIW, including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages from the FHA, the VA, other mortgage insurers, GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance and other alternatives to mortgage insurance. NIW does not include loans previously insured by us that are modified, such as loans modified under HARP. \n \u2022 Cancellations, which reduce IIF. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book, current home values compared to values when the loans in the in force book were insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. Home price appreciation can give homeowners the right to cancel mortgage insurance on their loans if sufficient home equity is achieved. Cancellations also result from policy rescissions, which require us to return any premiums received on the rescinded policies, and claim payments, which require us to return any premium received on the related policies from the date of default on the insured loans. Cancellations of single premium policies, which are generally non-refundable, result in immediate recognition of any remaining unearned premium. \n \u2022 Premium rates, which are affected by product type, competitive pressures, the risk characteristics of the insured loans and the percentage of coverage on the insured loans. The substantial majority of our monthly and annual mortgage insurance premiums are under premium plans for which, for the first ten years of the policy, the amount of premium is determined by multiplying the initial premium rate by the original loan balance; thereafter, the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. However, for loans that have utilized HARP, the initial ten-year period resets as of the date of the HARP transaction. The remainder of our monthly and annual premiums are under premium plans for which premiums are determined by a fixed percentage of the loan's amortizing balance over the life of the policy. \n \u2022 Premiums ceded, net of a profit commission, under reinsurance agreements. See Note 9 - Reinsurance\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance agreements. \nPremiums are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period. A change in the average IIF in the current period compared to an earlier period is a factor that will increase (when the average in force is higher) or reduce (when it is lower) premiums written and earned in the current period, although this effect may be enhanced (or mitigated) by differences in the average premium rate between the two periods, as well as by premiums that are returned or expected to be returned in connection with claim payments and rescissions, and premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements. Also, NIW and cancellations during a period will generally have a greater effect on premiums written and earned in subsequent periods than in the period in which these events occur.\nInvestment income\nOur investment portfolio is composed principally of investment grade fixed income securities. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of the investment portfolio is mainly a function of cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as NPW, investment income, net claim payments and expenses, and cash provided by (or used for) non-operating activities, such as debt or stock issuances or repurchases.\nMGIC Investment Corporation 2017 Form 10-K | 59\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MGIC Investment Corporation\n2017 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview (continued)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLosses incurred\nLosses incurred are the current expense that reflects estimated payments that will ultimately be made as a result of delinquencies on insured loans. As explained under Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below, we recognize an estimate of this expense only for delinquent loans. The level of new delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern, with new delinquencies in the first part of the year lower than new delinquencies in the latter part of the year, though this pattern can be affected by the state of the economy and local housing markets. Losses incurred are generally affected by:\n \u2022 The state of the economy, including unemployment and housing values, each of which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency. \n \u2022 The product mix of the in force book, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims. \n \u2022 The size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase losses incurred.
