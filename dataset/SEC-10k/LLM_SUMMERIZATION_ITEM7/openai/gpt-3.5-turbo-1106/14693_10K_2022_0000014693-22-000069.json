Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader better understand Brown-Forman, our operations, our financial results, and our current business environment. Please read this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d (the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Page </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Presentation basis </td> <td>30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant developments </td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Executive summary </td> <td>36\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of operations </td> <td>38\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and capital resources </td> <td>45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical accounting policies and estimates </td> <td>46\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPresentation Basis\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use some financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under GAAP. Other companies may not define or calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way.\nOrganic change\u201d in measures of statements of operations. We present changes in certain measures, or line items, of the statements of operations that are adjusted to an organic\u201d basis. We use organic change\u201d for the following measures of the statements of operations: (a) organic net sales; (b) organic cost of sales; (c) organic gross profit; (d) organic advertising expenses; (e) organic selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses; (f) organic other expense (income) net; (g) organic operating expenses2; and (h) organic operating income. To calculate these measures, we adjust, as applicable, for (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) foreign exchange, (3) impairment charges, and (4) a commitment to our charitable foundation. We explain these adjustments below.\n\u2022 Acquisitions and divestitures.\u201d This adjustment removes (a) the gain or loss recognized on sale of divested brands, (b) any non-recurring effects related to our acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., transaction, transition, and integration costs or income), and (c) the effects of operating activity related to acquired and divested brands for periods not comparable year over year (non-comparable periods). Excluding non-comparable periods allows us to include the effects of acquired and divested brands only to the extent that results are comparable year over year.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $127 million, and entered into a related transition services agreement (TSA) for these brands. Also, during fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThis adjustment removes (a) transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions and divestitures, (b) the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets, (c) operating activity for the non-comparable period for Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood, which is activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, (d) the net sales and operating expenses recognized pursuant to the TSA related to (i) contract bottling services and (ii) distribution services in certain markets, and (e) operating activity for Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited for the non-comparable period, which is primarily activity in the first two quarters of fiscal 2022. We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foreign exchange.\u201d We calculate the percentage change in certain line items of the statements of operations in accordance with GAAP and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. Adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the organic\n2 Operating expenses include advertising expense, SG&A expense, and other expense (income), net.\ntrend both positively and negatively. (In this report, dollar\u201d always means the U.S. dollar unless stated otherwise.) To eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current-year results at prior-year rates and remove transactional and hedging foreign exchange gains and losses from current- and prior-year periods.\n\u2022 Impairment Charges.\u201d This adjustment removes the impact of impairment charges from our results of operations.\nDuring the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $9 million for certain fixed assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for our Finlandia brand name. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foundation.\u201d During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we committed $20 million to the Brown-Forman Foundation (the Foundation) to support the communities where our employees live and work. This adjustment removes the $20 million commitment to the Foundation from our organic SG&A expenses and organic operating income to present our organic results on a comparable basis.\nWe use the non-GAAP measure organic change\u201d, along with other metrics, to: (a) understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis; (b) compare our performance to that of our competitors; (c) calculate components of management incentive compensation; (d) plan and forecast; and (e) communicate our financial performance to the Board of Directors, stockholders, and investment community. We provide reconciliations of the organic change\u201d in certain line items of the statements of operations to their nearest GAAP measures in the tables under Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Highlights\u201d and Results of Operations - Year-Over-Year Comparisons.\u201d We have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to readers and investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.\nAs of the third quarter ended January 31, 2022, we changed certain non-GAAP financial measures that we have historically used. We no longer report underlying changes\u201d in certain measures of the statements of operations; instead, we now report organic change\u201d for certain measures of the statements of operations. Organic change\u201d includes all of the non-GAAP adjustments that we have historically made in adjusting GAAP to underlying change\u201d results, except that organic change\u201d does not include an adjustment for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d which reflected the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on changes in certain line items of the statements of operations. This change to our non-GAAP financial measures was in response to comments from and discussions with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAlthough we no longer provide non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d we still believe that our results are affected by changes in distributor inventories, particularly in our largest market, the United States, where the spirits industry is subject to regulations that essentially mandate a so-called three-tier system,\u201d with a value chain that includes suppliers, distributors and retailers. Accordingly, we continue to provide information concerning fluctuations in distributor inventories. We believe such information is useful in understanding our performance and trends as it provides relevant information regarding customers' demand for our products.\nReturn on average invested capital.\u201d This measure refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt, and is calculated using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. After-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. We use this non-GAAP measure because we consider it to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we invest capital in our business.\nDefinitions\nAggregations.\nFrom time to time, to explain our results of operations or to highlight trends and uncertainties affecting our business, we aggregate markets according to stage of economic development as defined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we aggregate brands by beverage alcohol category. Below, we define the geographic and brand aggregations used in this report.\nGeographic Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Market Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest markets ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to markets listed by country name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Developed International\u201d markets are advanced economies\u201d as defined by the IMF, excluding the United States. In fiscal 2022, our largest developed international markets were Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Emerging\u201d markets are emerging and developing economies\u201d as defined by the IMF. In fiscal 2022, our largest emerging markets were Mexico, Poland, Brazil, Russia, and Chile. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Travel Retail\u201d represents our net sales of branded products to global duty-free customers, other travel retail customers, and the U.S. military, regardless of customer location.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine, regardless of customer location.\nBrand Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Brand Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest brands ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to brands listed by name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Whiskey\u201d includes all whiskey spirits and whiskey-based flavored liqueurs, ready-to-drink (RTD), and ready-to-pour products (RTP). The brands included in this category are the Jack Daniel's family of brands, the Woodford Reserve family of brands (Woodford Reserve), the Old Forester family of brands (Old Forester), GlenDronach, Benriach, Glenglassaugh, Slane Irish Whiskey, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 American whiskey\u201d includes the Jack Daniel's family of brands and premium bourbons (defined below).\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's family of brands\u201d includes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey (JDTW), Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP products (JD RTD/RTP), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey (JDTH), Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire (JDTF), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple (JDTA), Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Collection (JDSB), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye Whiskey (JDTR), Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select, Jack Daniel's Bonded, Jack Daniel's No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Bottled-in-Bond, Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old, and Jack Daniel's Triple Mash.\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP\u201d products include all RTD line extensions of Jack Daniel's, such as Jack Daniel's & Cola, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, Jack Daniel's Double Jack, and other malt- and spirit-based Jack Daniel's RTDs along with Jack Daniel's Winter Jack RTP.\n\u2022 Premium bourbons\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 Super-premium American whiskey\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack, and other super-premium Jack Daniel's expressions.\n\u2022 Tequila\u201d includes the Herradura family of brands (Herradura), el Jimador, New Mix, and other tequilas.\n\u2022 Wine\u201d includes Korbel Champagnes and Sonoma-Cutrer wines.\n\u2022 Vodka\u201d includes Finlandia.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine.\nOther Metrics.\n\u2022 Shipments.\u201d We generally record revenues when we ship or deliver our products to our customers. In this report, unless otherwise specified, we refer to shipments when discussing volume.\n\u2022 Depletions.\u201d This is a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry to describe volume. Depending on the context, depletions usually means either (a) where Brown-Forman is the distributor, shipments directly to retail or wholesale customers or (b) where Brown-Forman is not the distributor, shipments from distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. We believe that depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do.\n\u2022 Consumer takeaway.\u201d When discussing trends in the market, we refer to consumer takeaway, a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry that refers to the purchase of product by consumers from retail outlets, including products purchased through e-commerce channels, as measured by volume or retail sales value. This information is provided by\nthird parties, such as Nielsen and the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association (NABCA). Our estimates of market share or changes in market share are derived from consumer takeaway data using the retail sales value metric. We believe consumer takeaway is a leading indicator of consumer demand trends.\n\u2022 Estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d We generally recognize revenue when our products are shipped or delivered to customers. In the United States and certain other markets, our customers are distributors that sell downstream to retailers and consumers. We believe that our distributors' downstream sales more closely reflect actual consumer demand than do our shipments to distributors. Our shipments increase distributors' inventories, while distributors' depletions (as described above) reduce their inventories. Therefore, it is possible that our shipments do not coincide with distributors' downstream depletions and merely reflect changes in distributors' inventories. Because changes in distributors' inventories could affect our trends, we believe it is useful for investors to understand those changes in the context of our operating results.\nWe perform the following calculation to determine the estimated net change in distributor inventories\u201d:\n\u2022For both the current-year period and the comparable prior-year period, we calculate a depletion-based\u201d amount by (a) dividing the organic dollar amount (e.g. organic net sales) by the corresponding shipment volumes to arrive at a shipment per case amount, and (b) multiplying the resulting shipment per case amount by the corresponding depletion volumes. We subtract the year-over-year percentage change of the depletion-based\u201d amount from the year-over-year percentage change of the organic amount to calculate the estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d\n\u2022A positive difference is interpreted as a net increase in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could decrease as distributors' reduce inventories; whereas, a negative difference is interpreted as a net decrease in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could increase as distributors rebuild inventories.\nSignificant Developments\nBelow we discuss the significant developments in our business during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These developments relate to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19), supply chain disruptions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, innovation, and capital deployment.\nCOVID-19\nWe experienced strong, broad-based reported net sales growth across all of our geographic clusters and Travel Retail channel due to the gradual re-opening of the on-premise channel, some degree of travel and tourism returning, and growing premiumization trends. While the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to measure, we believe the timing and pace of global vaccination rates, governmental actions to lower or eliminate restrictions in certain economies around the world, and the post-pandemic economic recovery positively impacted our results when compared to the same prior-year period. We further discuss the effect of COVID-19 on our results where relevant below.\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nOur results were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions, largely related to glass supply. These disruptions curtailed our ability to fully meet demand and therefore negatively affected our net sales. Additionally, we incurred higher input and transportation costs due to the supply chain disruptions. We further discuss the effect of supply chain disruptions on our results where relevant below.\nRussia's Invasion of Ukraine\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, had a negative effect on our fiscal 2022 operating results. The most significant effect was the $52 million non-cash impairment charge for our Finlandia brand name (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information), which reflects a decline in our long-term outlook for Finlandia due to the suspension of operations in Russia, a key market for the brand. Additionally, operating income was negatively affected by other items attributable to the conflict such as (a) the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine, (b) bad debt expense, (c) inventory write-offs, and (d) severance expense. These negative effects were partially offset by the gain on terminated Russian ruble hedge contracts.\nAlthough reported net sales were negatively affected by the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine as a result of the conflict, the overall impact was not material to our consolidated full-year reported net sales growth rate, because (a) Russia and Ukraine represent a small share of total reported net sales and (b) the impact occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Prior to the onset of the conflict, Russia and Ukraine represented approximately 2% of our reported net sales. We expect the conflict to have a more significant negative effect on our fiscal 2023 reported net sales results, reflecting a full-year impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, and the ongoing disruption of our business in Ukraine. We further discuss the effect of the conflict on our fiscal 2022 results where relevant below.\nInnovation\n\u2022Jack Daniel's family of brands. Innovation within the Jack Daniel's family of brands has contributed to our growth in the last two years as described below.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we continued the international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, expanding to certain developed international and emerging markets.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021, we introduced new spirit-based RTD products in the United States.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2022, we launched Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old in the United States.\n\u2022Tequila brands. Tequila continues to be an attractive category, particularly in the United States, with both Herradura and el Jimador contributing significantly to our overall net sales growth. In fiscal 2021, we introduced Herradura Legend in the United States.\nCapital Deployment\n\u2022We have focused our capital deployment initiatives on (a) ensuring adequate liquidity and flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) fully investing in our existing business, (c) continued execution of our acquisitions and divestitures strategy, and (d) returning cash to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\n\u2022Investments. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures totaled $200 million and focused on enabling the growth of our premium whiskey brands:\n\u25e6During fiscal 2021, a $125 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our bourbon-making capacity in Kentucky to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6During fiscal 2022, a $50 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our scotch-making capacity to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6To support the continued growth of JDTW, we built an additional barrel warehouse at our Jack Daniel's distillery during fiscal 2022.\n\u2022Acquisitions and divestitures. During fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets. Also in fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\u2022Cash returned to stockholders. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we returned $1.2 billion to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\nExecutive Summary\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\n\u2022We delivered reported net sales of $3.9 billion, an increase of 14% compared to fiscal 2021. Reported net sales growth was driven by higher volumes and favorable price/mix, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales. Organic net sales increased 17% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\u25e6From a brand perspective, reported net sales growth was driven by JDTW, our tequilas, and premium bourbons.\n\u25e6From a geographic perspective, the United States, emerging markets, developed international markets, and the Travel Retail channel all contributed significantly to reported net sales growth.\nSupply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022We delivered reported operating income of $1.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in reported operating income was driven by reported net sales growth and the absence of the $20 million commitment to the Foundation in fiscal 2021, partially offset by (a) the effect of acquisitions and divestitures (primarily the fiscal 2021 gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood), (b) impairment charges, and (c) the negative effect of foreign exchange. Organic operating income increased 27% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\u2022We delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.74, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2021, due to higher income taxes, partially offset by an increase in reported operating income. Earnings per share in fiscal 2021 included an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\n\u2022Our return on average invested capital decreased to 17.7% in fiscal 2022, compared to 19.6% in fiscal 2021, driven primarily by higher income taxes. Return on average invested capital in fiscal 2021 benefited from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\nSummary of Operating Performance Fiscal 2021 and

by comparisons against COVID-19-related declines during fiscal 2021. See Significant Developments - COVID-19\u201d above for more information on the impact of COVID-19 on our results.\nThe United States, our most important market, grew reported net sales 10%, led by (a) JDTW, fueled by higher volumes and a favorable channel mix shift to the on-premise channel; (b) our premium bourbons, due to higher volumes and prices of Woodford Reserve and Old Forester; (c) our tequilas, driven by higher volumes of Herradura and el Jimador; and (d) volumetric growth of Sonoma-Cutrer. An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales. This growth was partially offset by the effect of acquisitions and divestitures along with lower volumes of JDTH. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\nDeveloped International\n\u2022Germany's reported net sales increased 11%, fueled by volumetric gains of JDTW and JD RTDs, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange.\n\u2022Australia's reported net sales increased 5%, driven primarily by higher pricing of JD RTDs, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange.\n\u2022The United Kingdom's reported net sales increased 7%, led by volumetric growth of JDTW, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022Reported net sales in the Rest of Developed International increased 32%, fueled by JDTW growth in Spain, Japan, and Korea, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\nEmerging\n\u2022Mexico's reported net sales increased 19%, driven by broad-based growth across our portfolio of brands, led by Herradura and JDTW, along with the positive effect of foreign exchange. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022Poland's reported net sales increased 9%, led by JDTW and Finlandia, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022Brazil's reported net sales increased 22%, fueled by the launch of JDTA, favorable price/mix of JDTW, and higher volumes of JDTH. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022Russia's reported net sales increased 7%, led by the launch of JDTA and higher pricing of Finlandia, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. Our fiscal 2022 reported net sales were adversely impacted by the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our fiscal 2023 outlook reflects the expected impact of a full-year suspension of our commercial operations in Russia.\n\u2022Chile's reported net sales increased 64%, driven by broad-based growth across much of our portfolio, led by higher volumes of JDTW and the launch of JDTA. Supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022Reported net sales in the Rest of Emerging increased 34%, driven primarily by JDTW gains, led by Turkey, Romania, and the United Arab Emirates. This growth was partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange (reflecting the strengthening of the dollar primarily against the Turkish lira). An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales.\nTravel Retail reported net sales increased 65%, fueled by higher volumes across much of our portfolio, led by JDTW, as we cycled against significant declines during the same prior-year period, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix.\nNon-branded and bulk reported net sales increased 6%, driven by higher volumes for used barrels.\nFiscal 2022 Brand Highlights\nThe following table highlights the global results of our largest brands for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.

Unfavorable cost/mix reflects (a) a shift in portfolio mix toward our higher-cost brands, (b) higher costs related to supply chain disruptions, (c) higher input costs related to grain and agave, and (d) inventory write-offs attributable to the impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change versus the prior fiscal year ended April 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in reported gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in organic gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Results may differ due to rounding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal year ended April 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior year gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price/mix </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost/mix </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Results may differ due to rounding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReported gross profit of $2.4 billion increased $297 million, or 14%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.

This increase in spend was partially offset by the absence of the $20 million commitment to the Foundation in fiscal 2021 and the positive effect of foreign exchange.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change versus the prior fiscal year ended April 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in reported operating income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foundation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in organic operating income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note: Results may differ due to rounding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReported operating income was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022, an increase of $38 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2021. Operating margin declined 3.1 percentage points to 30.6% in fiscal 2022 from 33.7% in fiscal 2021 driven by (a) the effect of acquisitions and divestitures (primarily the fiscal 2021 gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets), (b) unfavorable cost/mix, (c) impairment charges (primarily the non-cash impairment charge for our Finlandia brand name), and (d) the negative effect of foreign exchange. These factors were partially offset by (a) favorable price/mix, (b) operating expense (excluding impairment charges) leverage, and (c) the absence of the $20 million commitment to the Foundation in fiscal 2021.\nInterest expense (net) decreased $2 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, due to higher interest income driven by higher interest rates on our interest-bearing investments.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 24.8% compared to 16.5% in fiscal 2021. The increase in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by (a) the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in the prior-year related to an intercompany transfer of assets, (b) the impact of prior intercompany sales of inventory taxed at rates higher than current statutory tax rates, (c) increased expense from true-ups of prior-year tax liabilities, tax rate changes and other permanent differences; and (d) decreased benefit from stock-based compensation. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details.\nDiluted earnings per share were $1.74 in fiscal 2022, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2021 due to higher income taxes, partially offset by an increase in reported operating income. Earnings per share in fiscal 2021 included an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\nFiscal 2023 Outlook\nBelow we discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023 which reflects the trends, developments, and uncertainties, including those described above, we expect to affect our business. When we provide guidance for organic change in certain measures of the statements of operations we do not provide guidance for the corresponding GAAP change because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, such as foreign exchange, which could have a significant impact to our GAAP income statement measures.\nThe company anticipates continued growth in fiscal 2023 despite global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Accordingly, we expect the following in fiscal 2023:\n\u2022Reflecting the strength of our portfolio of brands and strong consumer demand, we expect organic net sales growth in the mid-single digit range.\n\u2022Considering the net effect of inflation and the removal of the European Union and United Kingdom tariffs on American whiskey, we project reported gross margin to increase slightly.\n\u2022Based on the above expectations, we anticipate mid-single digit organic operating income growth.\n\u2022We expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 22% to 23%.\n\u2022Capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $190 to $210 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate strong cash flows from operations, which enable us to meet current obligations, fund capital expenditures, and return cash to our stockholders through regular dividends and, from time to time, through share repurchases and special dividends. We believe our investment-grade credit ratings (A1 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's) provide us with financial flexibility when accessing global debt capital markets and allow us to reserve adequate debt capacity for investment opportunities and unforeseen events.\nOur cash flow from operations is supplemented by our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as access to other liquidity sources. Cash and cash equivalents were $1,150 million at April 30, 2021, and $868 million at April 30, 2022. As of April 30, 2022, approximately 71% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we expect to reinvest indefinitely outside of the United States. We continue to evaluate our future cash deployment and may decide to repatriate additional cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, which may require us to provide for and pay additional taxes.\nWe have an $800 million commercial paper program that we use, together with our cash flow from operations, to fund our short-term operational needs. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for outstanding commercial paper balances, interest rates, and days to maturity at April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2022. The average balances, interest rates, and original maturities during the periods ended April 30, 2021 and 2022, are presented below.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in millions) </td> <td>Three Months Average </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Average </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average commercial paper </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average days to maturity at issuance </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur commercial paper program is supported by available commitments under our $800 million bank credit facility. The credit facility, which was extended for an additional year in November 2021, is scheduled to expire in November 2024. At April 30, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. Although unlikely, under extreme market conditions, one or more participating banks may not be able to fund its commitments under our credit facility. To manage this counterparty credit risk, we partner with banks that have investment grade credit ratings, limit the amount of exposure we have with each bank, and monitor the financial conditions of each bank.\nOur most significant short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding our operations (such as expenditures for raw materials, production and distribution, advertising and promotion, and current taxes), repayment of our note maturing in 2023, and capital investments. Our most significant longer-term cash requirements primarily include payments related to our long-term debt, employee benefit obligations, and deferred tax liabilities (see Notes 6, 9 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nWhile we expect to meet our planned short-term liquidity needs largely through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program, a sustained market deterioration resulting in declines in net sales and profit could require us to evaluate alternative sources of liquidity. If we have additional liquidity needs, we believe that we could access financing in the debt capital markets.\nWe believe our current liquidity position, supplemented by our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future, and our ample debt capacity enabled by our strong short-term and long-term credit ratings, will be sufficient to meet all of our expected future financial commitments.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the last two years:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to property, plant, and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(138) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(127) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in short-term borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(196) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regular dividend payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(352) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special dividend payment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(479) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(485) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,038) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operations of $936 million increased $119 million from fiscal 2021, reflecting improved operating results and the impact of changes in working capital, which included the collection in December 2021 of approximately $62 million of accounts receivable from Bacardi that had been withheld since fiscal 2021. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about the Bacardi matter.)\nCash flows from investing activities decreased $127 million during fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $98 million during the prior year. The $225 million change largely reflects (a) the proceeds of $177 million received in the prior-year period from our divestiture of the Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets and (b) a $76 million increase in capital expenditures.\nCash used for financing activities was $1,038 million during fiscal 2022, compared to $485 million for fiscal 2021. The $553 million increase largely reflects a special cash dividend payment of $479 million in December 2021 and a $70 million increase in net repayments of short-term borrowings.\nA discussion of our cash flows for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 may be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2021.\nDividends\nAs announced in November 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.1885 per share from $0.1795 per share, effective with the regular quarterly dividend paid on December 28, 2021. As a result, the indicated annual cash dividend increased from $0.7180 per share to $0.7540 per share. The Board also declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share on our Class A and Class B common stock, which was paid on December 29, 2021.\nAs announced on May 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B common stock of $0.1885 per share. Stockholders of record on June 8, 2022, will receive the dividend on July 1, 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements reflect some estimates involved in applying the following critical accounting policies that entail uncertainties and subjectivity. Using different estimates or policies could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe have obtained most of our brands by acquiring other companies. When we acquire another company, we first allocate the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible brand names and trademarks ( brand names\u201d), based on estimated fair value. We then record any remaining purchase price as goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. We consider all of our brand names to have indefinite lives.\nWe assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the goodwill by the amount of the excess (limited to the carrying amount of the goodwill). We estimate the reporting unit's fair value using discounted estimated future cash flows or market information. Similarly, a brand name is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we write down the brand name to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a brand name using the relief from royalty\u201d method. We also consider market values for similar assets when available. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including making assumptions about future cash flows, net sales, discount rates, and royalty rates.\nWe have the option, before quantifying the fair value of a reporting unit or brand name, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill or brand names are impaired. If we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. That assessment also takes considerable management judgment.\nBased on our assumptions, we believe none of our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired as of April 30, 2022. Further, we estimate the fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets substantially exceed their carrying amounts, except for our Finlandia brand name. As of April 30, 2022, the carrying amount of the Finlandia brand name is $181 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for the Finlandia brand name. The impairment reflects a decline in our long-term outlook for Finlandia due to our suspension of operations in Russia, a key market for the brand. We determined Finlandia's fair value based on the relief from royalty\u201d method, using current assumptions. Reasonably possible changes in those assumptions could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. For example, we estimate that, all else equal, (a) a 15% decline in projected future net sales would result in an impairment charge of approximately $19 million or (b) a 1 percentage point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $29 million.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits. Benefits are based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. We expense the benefits expected to be paid over employees' expected service. This requires us to make assumptions to determine the net benefit costs and obligations, such as discount rates, return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases, expected service, and health care cost trend rates. We review these assumptions annually and modify them based on current rates and trends when appropriate. The assumptions also reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. We believe the discount rates and expected return on plan assets are the most significant assumptions.\nThe discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations is determined at the beginning of each fiscal year using a yield curve based on the interest rates of high-quality debt securities with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of our benefit payments. The service cost and interest cost components are measured by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve. The expected return on pension plan assets reflects expected capital market returns for each asset class that are based on historical returns, adjusted for the expected effects of diversification.\nThe following table compares the assumed discount rates and expected return on assets used in determining net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2022 to those to be used in determining that cost for fiscal 2023.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>Medical and Life\nInsurance Benefits </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate for service cost </td> <td>3.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate for interest cost </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUsing these assumptions, we estimate our pension and other postretirement benefit cost for fiscal 2023 will be approximately $21 million, compared to $28 million (excluding settlement charges) for fiscal 2022. Decreasing/increasing the\nassumed discount rates by 50 basis points would increase/decrease the total fiscal 2023 cost by approximately $6 million. Decreasing/increasing the assumed return on plan assets by 50 basis points would increase/decrease the total fiscal 2023 cost by approximately $4 million.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. We establish liabilities when some positions are likely to be challenged and may not succeed, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. We believe current liabilities are appropriate for all known contingencies, but this situation could change.\nYears can elapse before we can resolve a particular matter for which we may have established a tax liability. Although predicting the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter can be difficult, we believe our liabilities reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could require use of our cash and increase our effective tax rate. Conversely, a favorable resolution could result in reduced cash tax payments, the reversal of previously established liabilities, or some combination of these results, which could reduce our effective tax rate.", "summary": "The MD&A report provides an overview of Brown-Forman's financial condition and results of operations.

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader better understand Brown-Forman, our operations, our financial results, and our current business environment. Please read this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d (the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\n\nPresentation Basis\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use some financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under GAAP. Other companies may not define or calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way.\nOrganic change\u201d in measures of statements of operations. We present changes in certain measures, or line items, of the statements of operations that are adjusted to an organic\u201d basis. We use organic change\u201d for the following measures of the statements of operations: (a) organic net sales; (b) organic cost of sales; (c) organic gross profit; (d) organic advertising expenses; (e) organic selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses; (f) organic other expense (income) net; (g) organic operating expenses2; and (h) organic operating income. To calculate these measures, we adjust, as applicable, for (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) foreign exchange, (3) impairment charges, and (4) a commitment to our charitable foundation. We explain these adjustments below.\n\u2022 Acquisitions and divestitures.\u201d This adjustment removes (a) the gain or loss recognized on sale of divested brands, (b) any non-recurring effects related to our acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., transaction, transition, and integration costs or income), and (c) the effects of operating activity related to acquired and divested brands for periods not comparable year over year (non-comparable periods). Excluding non-comparable periods allows us to include the effects of acquired and divested brands only to the extent that results are comparable year over year.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $127 million, and entered into a related transition services agreement (TSA) for these brands. Also, during fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThis adjustment removes (a) transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions and divestitures, (b) the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets, (c) operating activity for the non-comparable period for Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood, which is activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, (d) the net sales and operating expenses recognized pursuant to the TSA related to (i) contract bottling services and (ii) distribution services in certain markets, and (e) operating activity for Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited for the non-comparable period, which is primarily activity in the first two quarters of fiscal 2022. We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foreign exchange.\u201d We calculate the percentage change in certain line items of the statements of operations in accordance with GAAP and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. Adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the organic\n2 Operating expenses include advertising expense, SG&A expense, and other expense (income), net.\ntrend both positively and negatively. (In this report, dollar\u201d always means the U.S. dollar unless stated otherwise.) To eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current-year results at prior-year rates and remove transactional and hedging foreign exchange gains and losses from current- and prior-year periods.\n\u2022 Impairment Charges.\u201d This adjustment removes the impact of impairment charges from our results of operations.\nDuring the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $9 million for certain fixed assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for our Finlandia brand name. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foundation.\u201d During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we committed $20 million to the Brown-Forman Foundation (the Foundation) to support the communities where our employees live and work. This adjustment removes the $20 million commitment to the Foundation from our organic SG&A expenses and organic operating income to present our organic results on a comparable basis.\nWe use the non-GAAP measure organic change\u201d, along with other metrics, to: (a) understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis; (b) compare our performance to that of our competitors; (c) calculate components of management incentive compensation; (d) plan and forecast; and (e) communicate our financial performance to the Board of Directors, stockholders, and investment community. We provide reconciliations of the organic change\u201d in certain line items of the statements of operations to their nearest GAAP measures in the tables under Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Highlights\u201d and Results of Operations - Year-Over-Year Comparisons.\u201d We have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to readers and investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.\nAs of the third quarter ended January 31, 2022, we changed certain non-GAAP financial measures that we have historically used. We no longer report underlying changes\u201d in certain measures of the statements of operations; instead, we now report organic change\u201d for certain measures of the statements of operations. Organic change\u201d includes all of the non-GAAP adjustments that we have historically made in adjusting GAAP to underlying change\u201d results, except that organic change\u201d does not include an adjustment for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d which reflected the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on changes in certain line items of the statements of operations. This change to our non-GAAP financial measures was in response to comments from and discussions with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAlthough we no longer provide non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d we still believe that our results are affected by changes in distributor inventories, particularly in our largest market, the United States, where the spirits industry is subject to regulations that essentially mandate a so-called three-tier system,\u201d with a value chain that includes suppliers, distributors and retailers. Accordingly, we continue to provide information concerning fluctuations in distributor inventories. We believe such information is useful in understanding our performance and trends as it provides relevant information regarding customers' demand for our products.\nReturn on average invested capital.\u201d This measure refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt, and is calculated using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. After-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. We use this non-GAAP measure because we consider it to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we invest capital in our business.\nDefinitions\nAggregations.\nFrom time to time, to explain our results of operations or to highlight trends and uncertainties affecting our business, we aggregate markets according to stage of economic development as defined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we aggregate brands by beverage alcohol category. Below, we define the geographic and brand aggregations used in this report.\nGeographic Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Market Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest markets ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to markets listed by country name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Developed International\u201d markets are advanced economies\u201d as defined by the IMF, excluding the United States. In fiscal 2022, our largest developed international markets were Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Emerging\u201d markets are emerging and developing economies\u201d as defined by the IMF. In fiscal 2022, our largest emerging markets were Mexico, Poland, Brazil, Russia, and Chile. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Travel Retail\u201d represents our net sales of branded products to global duty-free customers, other travel retail customers, and the U.S. military, regardless of customer location.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine, regardless of customer location.\nBrand Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Brand Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest brands ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to brands listed by name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Whiskey\u201d includes all whiskey spirits and whiskey-based flavored liqueurs, ready-to-drink (RTD), and ready-to-pour products (RTP). The brands included in this category are the Jack Daniel's family of brands, the Woodford Reserve family of brands (Woodford Reserve), the Old Forester family of brands (Old Forester), GlenDronach, Benriach, Glenglassaugh, Slane Irish Whiskey, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 American whiskey\u201d includes the Jack Daniel's family of brands and premium bourbons (defined below).\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's family of brands\u201d includes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey (JDTW), Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP products (JD RTD/RTP), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey (JDTH), Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire (JDTF), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple (JDTA), Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Collection (JDSB), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye Whiskey (JDTR), Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select, Jack Daniel's Bonded, Jack Daniel's No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Bottled-in-Bond, Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old, and Jack Daniel's Triple Mash.\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP\u201d products include all RTD line extensions of Jack Daniel's, such as Jack Daniel's & Cola, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, Jack Daniel's Double Jack, and other malt- and spirit-based Jack Daniel's RTDs along with Jack Daniel's Winter Jack RTP.\n\u2022 Premium bourbons\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 Super-premium American whiskey\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack, and other super-premium Jack Daniel's expressions.\n\u2022 Tequila\u201d includes the Herradura family of brands (Herradura), el Jimador, New Mix, and other tequilas.\n\u2022 Wine\u201d includes Korbel Champagnes and Sonoma-Cutrer wines.\n\u2022 Vodka\u201d includes Finlandia.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine.\nOther Metrics.\n\u2022 Shipments.\u201d We generally record revenues when we ship or deliver our products to our customers. In this report, unless otherwise specified, we refer to shipments when discussing volume.\n\u2022 Depletions.\u201d This is a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry to describe volume. Depending on the context, depletions usually means either (a) where Brown-Forman is the distributor, shipments directly to retail or wholesale customers or (b) where Brown-Forman is not the distributor, shipments from distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. We believe that depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do.\n\u2022 Consumer takeaway.\u201d When discussing trends in the market, we refer to consumer takeaway, a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry that refers to the purchase of product by consumers from retail outlets, including products purchased through e-commerce channels, as measured by volume or retail sales value. This information is provided by\nthird parties, such as Nielsen and the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association (NABCA). Our estimates of market share or changes in market share are derived from consumer takeaway data using the retail sales value metric. We believe consumer takeaway is a leading indicator of consumer demand trends.\n\u2022 Estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d We generally recognize revenue when our products are shipped or delivered to customers. In the United States and certain other markets, our customers are distributors that sell downstream to retailers and consumers. We believe that our distributors' downstream sales more closely reflect actual consumer demand than do our shipments to distributors. Our shipments increase distributors' inventories, while distributors' depletions (as described above) reduce their inventories. Therefore, it is possible that our shipments do not coincide with distributors' downstream depletions and merely reflect changes in distributors' inventories. Because changes in distributors' inventories could affect our trends, we believe it is useful for investors to understand those changes in the context of our operating results.\nWe perform the following calculation to determine the estimated net change in distributor inventories\u201d:\n\u2022For both the current-year period and the comparable prior-year period, we calculate a depletion-based\u201d amount by (a) dividing the organic dollar amount (e.g. organic net sales) by the corresponding shipment volumes to arrive at a shipment per case amount, and (b) multiplying the resulting shipment per case amount by the corresponding depletion volumes. We subtract the year-over-year percentage change of the depletion-based\u201d amount from the year-over-year percentage change of the organic amount to calculate the estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d\n\u2022A positive difference is interpreted as a net increase in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could decrease as distributors' reduce inventories; whereas, a negative difference is interpreted as a net decrease in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could increase as distributors rebuild inventories.\nSignificant Developments\nBelow we discuss the significant developments in our business during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These developments relate to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19), supply chain disruptions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, innovation, and capital deployment.\nCOVID-19\nWe experienced strong, broad-based reported net sales growth across all of our geographic clusters and Travel Retail channel due to the gradual re-opening of the on-premise channel, some degree of travel and tourism returning, and growing premiumization trends. While the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to measure, we believe the timing and pace of global vaccination rates, governmental actions to lower or eliminate restrictions in certain economies around the world, and the post-pandemic economic recovery positively impacted our results when compared to the same prior-year period. We further discuss the effect of COVID-19 on our results where relevant below.\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nOur results were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions, largely related to glass supply. These disruptions curtailed our ability to fully meet demand and therefore negatively affected our net sales. Additionally, we incurred higher input and transportation costs due to the supply chain disruptions. We further discuss the effect of supply chain disruptions on our results where relevant below.\nRussia's Invasion of Ukraine\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, had a negative effect on our fiscal 2022 operating results. The most significant effect was the $52 million non-cash impairment charge for our Finlandia brand name (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information), which reflects a decline in our long-term outlook for Finlandia due to the suspension of operations in Russia, a key market for the brand. Additionally, operating income was negatively affected by other items attributable to the conflict such as (a) the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine, (b) bad debt expense, (c) inventory write-offs, and (d) severance expense. These negative effects were partially offset by the gain on terminated Russian ruble hedge contracts.\nAlthough reported net sales were negatively affected by the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine as a result of the conflict, the overall impact was not material to our consolidated full-year reported net sales growth rate, because (a) Russia and Ukraine represent a small share of total reported net sales and (b) the impact occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Prior to the onset of the conflict, Russia and Ukraine represented approximately 2% of our reported net sales. We expect the conflict to have a more significant negative effect on our fiscal 2023 reported net sales results, reflecting a full-year impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, and the ongoing disruption of our business in Ukraine. We further discuss the effect of the conflict on our fiscal 2022 results where relevant below.\nInnovation\n\u2022Jack Daniel's family of brands. Innovation within the Jack Daniel's family of brands has contributed to our growth in the last two years as described below.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we continued the international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, expanding to certain developed international and emerging markets.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021, we introduced new spirit-based RTD products in the United States.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2022, we launched Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old in the United States.\n\u2022Tequila brands. Tequila continues to be an attractive category, particularly in the United States, with both Herradura and el Jimador contributing significantly to our overall net sales growth. In fiscal 2021, we introduced Herradura Legend in the United States.\nCapital Deployment\n\u2022We have focused our capital deployment initiatives on (a) ensuring adequate liquidity and flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) fully investing in our existing business, (c) continued execution of our acquisitions and divestitures strategy, and (d) returning cash to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\n\u2022Investments. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures totaled $200 million and focused on enabling the growth of our premium whiskey brands:\n\u25e6During fiscal 2021, a $125 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our bourbon-making capacity in Kentucky to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6During fiscal 2022, a $50 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our scotch-making capacity to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6To support the continued growth of JDTW, we built an additional barrel warehouse at our Jack Daniel's distillery during fiscal 2022.\n\u2022Acquisitions and divestitures. During fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets. Also in fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\u2022Cash returned to stockholders. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we returned $1.2 billion to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\nExecutive Summary\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\n\u2022We delivered reported net sales of $3.9 billion, an increase of 14% compared to fiscal 2021. Reported net sales growth was driven by higher volumes and favorable price/mix, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales. Organic net sales increased 17% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\u25e6From a brand perspective, reported net sales growth was driven by JDTW, our tequilas, and premium bourbons.\n\u25e6From a geographic perspective, the United States, emerging markets, developed international markets, and the Travel Retail channel all contributed significantly to reported net sales growth.\nSupply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on results.\n\u2022We delivered reported operating income of $1.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in reported operating income was driven by reported net sales growth and the absence of the $20 million commitment to the Foundation in fiscal 2021, partially offset by (a) the effect of acquisitions and divestitures (primarily the fiscal 2021 gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood), (b) impairment charges, and (c) the negative effect of foreign exchange. Organic operating income increased 27% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\u2022We delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.74, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2021, due to higher income taxes, partially offset by an increase in reported operating income. Earnings per share in fiscal 2021 included an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\n\u2022Our return on average invested capital decreased to 17.7% in fiscal 2022, compared to 19.6% in fiscal 2021, driven primarily by higher income taxes. Return on average invested capital in fiscal 2021 benefited from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\nSummary of Operating Performance Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022 \n \n1See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above for details on our use of organic change\u201d and return on average invested capital,\u201d including how we calculate these measures and why we think this information is useful to readers.\n2Operating expenses include advertising expense, SG&A expense, and other expense (income), net.\n3Year-over-year changes in percentages are reported in percentage points (pp).\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2022 Market Highlights\nThe following table shows net sales results for our largest markets, summarized by geographic area, for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. We discuss results of the markets most affecting our performance below the table.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader better understand Brown-Forman, our operations, our financial results, and our current business environment. Please read this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d (the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Page </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Presentation basis </td> <td>30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant developments </td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Executive summary </td> <td>36\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of operations </td> <td>38\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and capital resources </td> <td>45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical accounting policies and estimates </td> <td>46\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPresentation Basis\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use some financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under GAAP. Other companies may not define or calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way.\nOrganic change\u201d in measures of statements of operations. We present changes in certain measures, or line items, of the statements of operations that are adjusted to an organic\u201d basis. We use organic change\u201d for the following measures of the statements of operations: (a) organic net sales; (b) organic cost of sales; (c) organic gross profit; (d) organic advertising expenses; (e) organic selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses; (f) organic other expense (income) net; (g) organic operating expenses2; and (h) organic operating income. To calculate these measures, we adjust, as applicable, for (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) foreign exchange, (3) impairment charges, and (4) a commitment to our charitable foundation. We explain these adjustments below.\n\u2022 Acquisitions and divestitures.\u201d This adjustment removes (a) the gain or loss recognized on sale of divested brands, (b) any non-recurring effects related to our acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., transaction, transition, and integration costs or income), and (c) the effects of operating activity related to acquired and divested brands for periods not comparable year over year (non-comparable periods). Excluding non-comparable periods allows us to include the effects of acquired and divested brands only to the extent that results are comparable year over year.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $127 million, and entered into a related transition services agreement (TSA) for these brands. Also, during fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThis adjustment removes (a) transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions and divestitures, (b) the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets, (c) operating activity for the non-comparable period for Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood, which is activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, (d) the net sales and operating expenses recognized pursuant to the TSA related to (i) contract bottling services and (ii) distribution services in certain markets, and (e) operating activity for Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited for the non-comparable period, which is primarily activity in the first two quarters of fiscal 2022. We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foreign exchange.\u201d We calculate the percentage change in certain line items of the statements of operations in accordance with GAAP and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. Adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the organic\n2 Operating expenses include advertising expense, SG&A expense, and other expense (income), net.\ntrend both positively and negatively. (In this report, dollar\u201d always means the U.S. dollar unless stated otherwise.) To eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current-year results at prior-year rates and remove transactional and hedging foreign exchange gains and losses from current- and prior-year periods.\n\u2022 Impairment Charges.\u201d This adjustment removes the impact of impairment charges from our results of operations.\nDuring the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $9 million for certain fixed assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $52 million for our Finlandia brand name. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.We believe that these adjustments allow for us to better understand our organic results on a comparable basis.\n\u2022 Foundation.\u201d During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we committed $20 million to the Brown-Forman Foundation (the Foundation) to support the communities where our employees live and work. This adjustment removes the $20 million commitment to the Foundation from our organic SG&A expenses and organic operating income to present our organic results on a comparable basis.\nWe use the non-GAAP measure organic change\u201d, along with other metrics, to: (a) understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis; (b) compare our performance to that of our competitors; (c) calculate components of management incentive compensation; (d) plan and forecast; and (e) communicate our financial performance to the Board of Directors, stockholders, and investment community. We provide reconciliations of the organic change\u201d in certain line items of the statements of operations to their nearest GAAP measures in the tables under Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Highlights\u201d and Results of Operations - Year-Over-Year Comparisons.\u201d We have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to readers and investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.\nAs of the third quarter ended January 31, 2022, we changed certain non-GAAP financial measures that we have historically used. We no longer report underlying changes\u201d in certain measures of the statements of operations; instead, we now report organic change\u201d for certain measures of the statements of operations. Organic change\u201d includes all of the non-GAAP adjustments that we have historically made in adjusting GAAP to underlying change\u201d results, except that organic change\u201d does not include an adjustment for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d which reflected the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on changes in certain line items of the statements of operations. This change to our non-GAAP financial measures was in response to comments from and discussions with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAlthough we no longer provide non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for estimated net change in distributor inventories,\u201d we still believe that our results are affected by changes in distributor inventories, particularly in our largest market, the United States, where the spirits industry is subject to regulations that essentially mandate a so-called three-tier system,\u201d with a value chain that includes suppliers, distributors and retailers. Accordingly, we continue to provide information concerning fluctuations in distributor inventories. We believe such information is useful in understanding our performance and trends as it provides relevant information regarding customers' demand for our products.\nReturn on average invested capital.\u201d This measure refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt, and is calculated using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. After-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. We use this non-GAAP measure because we consider it to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we invest capital in our business.\nDefinitions\nAggregations.\nFrom time to time, to explain our results of operations or to highlight trends and uncertainties affecting our business, we aggregate markets according to stage of economic development as defined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we aggregate brands by beverage alcohol category. Below, we define the geographic and brand aggregations used in this report.\nGeographic Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Market Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest markets ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to markets listed by country name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Developed International\u201d markets are advanced economies\u201d as defined by the IMF, excluding the United States. In fiscal 2022, our largest developed international markets were Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Emerging\u201d markets are emerging and developing economies\u201d as defined by the IMF. In fiscal 2022, our largest emerging markets were Mexico, Poland, Brazil, Russia, and Chile. This aggregation represents our net sales of branded products to these markets.\n\u2022 Travel Retail\u201d represents our net sales of branded products to global duty-free customers, other travel retail customers, and the U.S. military, regardless of customer location.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine, regardless of customer location.\nBrand Aggregations.\nIn Results of Operations - Fiscal 2022 Brand Highlights,\u201d we provide supplemental information for our largest brands ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2022 net sales. In addition to brands listed by name, we include the following aggregations:\n\u2022 Whiskey\u201d includes all whiskey spirits and whiskey-based flavored liqueurs, ready-to-drink (RTD), and ready-to-pour products (RTP). The brands included in this category are the Jack Daniel's family of brands, the Woodford Reserve family of brands (Woodford Reserve), the Old Forester family of brands (Old Forester), GlenDronach, Benriach, Glenglassaugh, Slane Irish Whiskey, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 American whiskey\u201d includes the Jack Daniel's family of brands and premium bourbons (defined below).\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's family of brands\u201d includes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey (JDTW), Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP products (JD RTD/RTP), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey (JDTH), Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire (JDTF), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple (JDTA), Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Collection (JDSB), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye Whiskey (JDTR), Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select, Jack Daniel's Bonded, Jack Daniel's No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Bottled-in-Bond, Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old, and Jack Daniel's Triple Mash.\n\u2022 Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP\u201d products include all RTD line extensions of Jack Daniel's, such as Jack Daniel's & Cola, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, Jack Daniel's Double Jack, and other malt- and spirit-based Jack Daniel's RTDs along with Jack Daniel's Winter Jack RTP.\n\u2022 Premium bourbons\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, and Coopers' Craft.\n\u2022 Super-premium American whiskey\u201d includes Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack, and other super-premium Jack Daniel's expressions.\n\u2022 Tequila\u201d includes the Herradura family of brands (Herradura), el Jimador, New Mix, and other tequilas.\n\u2022 Wine\u201d includes Korbel Champagnes and Sonoma-Cutrer wines.\n\u2022 Vodka\u201d includes Finlandia.\n\u2022 Non-branded and bulk\u201d includes our net sales of used barrels, contract bottling, and bulk whiskey and wine.\nOther Metrics.\n\u2022 Shipments.\u201d We generally record revenues when we ship or deliver our products to our customers. In this report, unless otherwise specified, we refer to shipments when discussing volume.\n\u2022 Depletions.\u201d This is a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry to describe volume. Depending on the context, depletions usually means either (a) where Brown-Forman is the distributor, shipments directly to retail or wholesale customers or (b) where Brown-Forman is not the distributor, shipments from distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. We believe that depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do.\n\u2022 Consumer takeaway.\u201d When discussing trends in the market, we refer to consumer takeaway, a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry that refers to the purchase of product by consumers from retail outlets, including products purchased through e-commerce channels, as measured by volume or retail sales value. This information is provided by\nthird parties, such as Nielsen and the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association (NABCA). Our estimates of market share or changes in market share are derived from consumer takeaway data using the retail sales value metric. We believe consumer takeaway is a leading indicator of consumer demand trends.\n\u2022 Estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d We generally recognize revenue when our products are shipped or delivered to customers. In the United States and certain other markets, our customers are distributors that sell downstream to retailers and consumers. We believe that our distributors' downstream sales more closely reflect actual consumer demand than do our shipments to distributors. Our shipments increase distributors' inventories, while distributors' depletions (as described above) reduce their inventories. Therefore, it is possible that our shipments do not coincide with distributors' downstream depletions and merely reflect changes in distributors' inventories. Because changes in distributors' inventories could affect our trends, we believe it is useful for investors to understand those changes in the context of our operating results.\nWe perform the following calculation to determine the estimated net change in distributor inventories\u201d:\n\u2022For both the current-year period and the comparable prior-year period, we calculate a depletion-based\u201d amount by (a) dividing the organic dollar amount (e.g. organic net sales) by the corresponding shipment volumes to arrive at a shipment per case amount, and (b) multiplying the resulting shipment per case amount by the corresponding depletion volumes. We subtract the year-over-year percentage change of the depletion-based\u201d amount from the year-over-year percentage change of the organic amount to calculate the estimated net change in distributor inventories.\u201d\n\u2022A positive difference is interpreted as a net increase in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could decrease as distributors' reduce inventories; whereas, a negative difference is interpreted as a net decrease in distributors' inventories, which implies that organic trends could increase as distributors rebuild inventories.\nSignificant Developments\nBelow we discuss the significant developments in our business during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These developments relate to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19), supply chain disruptions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, innovation, and capital deployment.\nCOVID-19\nWe experienced strong, broad-based reported net sales growth across all of our geographic clusters and Travel Retail channel due to the gradual re-opening of the on-premise channel, some degree of travel and tourism returning, and growing premiumization trends. While the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to measure, we believe the timing and pace of global vaccination rates, governmental actions to lower or eliminate restrictions in certain economies around the world, and the post-pandemic economic recovery positively impacted our results when compared to the same prior-year period. We further discuss the effect of COVID-19 on our results where relevant below.\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nOur results were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions, largely related to glass supply. These disruptions curtailed our ability to fully meet demand and therefore negatively affected our net sales. Additionally, we incurred higher input and transportation costs due to the supply chain disruptions. We further discuss the effect of supply chain disruptions on our results where relevant below.\nRussia's Invasion of Ukraine\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, had a negative effect on our fiscal 2022 operating results. The most significant effect was the $52 million non-cash impairment charge for our Finlandia brand name (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information), which reflects a decline in our long-term outlook for Finlandia due to the suspension of operations in Russia, a key market for the brand. Additionally, operating income was negatively affected by other items attributable to the conflict such as (a) the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine, (b) bad debt expense, (c) inventory write-offs, and (d) severance expense. These negative effects were partially offset by the gain on terminated Russian ruble hedge contracts.\nAlthough reported net sales were negatively affected by the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and our diminished ability to conduct business in Ukraine as a result of the conflict, the overall impact was not material to our consolidated full-year reported net sales growth rate, because (a) Russia and Ukraine represent a small share of total reported net sales and (b) the impact occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Prior to the onset of the conflict, Russia and Ukraine represented approximately 2% of our reported net sales. We expect the conflict to have a more significant negative effect on our fiscal 2023 reported net sales results, reflecting a full-year impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, and the ongoing disruption of our business in Ukraine. We further discuss the effect of the conflict on our fiscal 2022 results where relevant below.\nInnovation\n\u2022Jack Daniel's family of brands. Innovation within the Jack Daniel's family of brands has contributed to our growth in the last two years as described below.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we continued the international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, expanding to certain developed international and emerging markets.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2021, we introduced new spirit-based RTD products in the United States.\n\u25e6In fiscal 2022, we launched Jack Daniel's 10 Year Old in the United States.\n\u2022Tequila brands. Tequila continues to be an attractive category, particularly in the United States, with both Herradura and el Jimador contributing significantly to our overall net sales growth. In fiscal 2021, we introduced Herradura Legend in the United States.\nCapital Deployment\n\u2022We have focused our capital deployment initiatives on (a) ensuring adequate liquidity and flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) fully investing in our existing business, (c) continued execution of our acquisitions and divestitures strategy, and (d) returning cash to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\n\u2022Investments. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures totaled $200 million and focused on enabling the growth of our premium whiskey brands:\n\u25e6During fiscal 2021, a $125 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our bourbon-making capacity in Kentucky to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6During fiscal 2022, a $50 million capital investment was approved by our Board of Directors to expand our scotch-making capacity to meet anticipated future consumer demand.\n\u25e6To support the continued growth of JDTW, we built an additional barrel warehouse at our Jack Daniel's distillery during fiscal 2022.\n\u2022Acquisitions and divestitures. During fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood brands and related assets. Also in fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time Rangers Holdings Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\u2022Cash returned to stockholders. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we returned $1.2 billion to our stockholders through regular and special dividends.\nExecutive Summary\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\n\u2022We delivered reported net sales of $3.9 billion, an increase of 14% compared to fiscal 2021. Reported net sales growth was driven by higher volumes and favorable price/mix, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. An estimated net increase in distributor inventories positively impacted reported net sales.

The increase in reported operating income was driven by reported net sales growth and the absence of the $20 million commitment to the Foundation in fiscal 2021, partially offset by (a) the effect of acquisitions and divestitures (primarily the fiscal 2021 gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood), (b) impairment charges, and (c) the negative effect of foreign exchange. Organic operating income increased 27% compared to fiscal 2021.\n\u2022We delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.74, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2021, due to higher income taxes, partially offset by an increase in reported operating income. Earnings per share in fiscal 2021 included an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\n\u2022Our return on average invested capital decreased to 17.7% in fiscal 2022, compared to 19.6% in fiscal 2021, driven primarily by higher income taxes. Return on average invested capital in fiscal 2021 benefited from the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood and related assets.\nSummary of Operating Performance Fiscal 2021 and
