Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming.\nFor additional information on the competition our businesses face, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the Competition\u201d discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively\u201d and Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\u201d\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations.

Certain assets in our Cable Communications segment have relatively short estimated useful lives, which also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in 2018 and 2017 and will continue to increase depreciation expense in 2019.

We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net.

Our effective income tax rate in 2018 was 22.2%, which included the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and also an income tax benefit of $128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018, which were partially offset by higher taxable income from operations and $148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. We recognized an income tax benefit of $244 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of Sky. See Note 5 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on tax reform.\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 49.3%. The enactment of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a net income tax benefit of $12.7 billion in 2017, primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 33.3%.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of $297 million in 2017. Our income tax benefit also increased $121 million due to the impact of an internal legal reorganization in the third quarter of 2017, which was partially offset by a decrease of $53 million due to changes in state tax laws. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 was an expense of 37.0%.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2018 was primarily due to the noncontrolling interest holders' share of the loss related to Universal Beijing Resort. In 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China and obtained a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort. See Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on noncontrolling interest related to Universal Beijing Resort. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2017 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interests in Universal Studios Japan that we did not already own in April 2017.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Operating Results\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax benefit (expense), investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure. We reconcile the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nTo be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2017 and 2016

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. For multiple dwelling units ( MDUs\u201d), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video ( HD\u201d) or digital video recorder ( DVR\u201d) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. In 2017, we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of December 31, 2018 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 135,000 and 5,000, respectively. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. Single product, double product, and triple and quad product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three and four of our cable services, respectively.\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $153.95 and $152.70, respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship.\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $62.67 and $60.62, respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services.\nCable Communications Segment - Revenue\nCable Communications is one of the nation's largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice and security and automation services ( cable services\u201d) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services. Our Cable Communications segment also generates revenue from selling through our allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that is received as part of distribution agreements with these networks to local, regional and national advertisers.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHigh-Speed Internet\nCable Communications offers high-speed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second ( Gbps\u201d) and fiber-based speeds that range up to 2 Gbps.

We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments.\nVoice\nCable Communications offers voice services that provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.\nVoice revenue decreased 3.2% in 2018 primarily due to:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decline in the number of residential voice customers\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the amount allocated to voice revenue for bundled services\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Voice revenue decreased 1.7% in 2017 primarily due to:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the amount allocated to voice revenue for bundled services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decline in the number of residential voice customers\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline.\nBusiness Services\nCable Communications offers a variety of products and services to businesses. Small business services offerings primarily include high-speed internet services, as well as voice and video services. Cable Communications also offers Ethernet network services to medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, as well as advanced voice services, along with video solutions that serve hotels and other large venues. In addition, cellular backhaul services are provided to mobile network operators to help them manage their network bandwidth.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCable Communications has expanded its enterprise service offerings to include a software-defined networking product for our medium-sized and enterprise customers. Enterprise customers may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. Enterprise service offerings are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations.\nBusiness services revenue increased 10.7% and 12.8% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in the number of customers receiving our small and medium-sized business services offerings\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in average rates\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenue from our small business services offerings represented the majority of our total business services revenue. We believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing. We expect that the contribution to our growth rate from medium-sized and enterprise customers will increase relative to that of our small-business customers as small business service matures.\nAdvertising\nAs part of Cable Communications' distribution agreements with cable networks, it generally receives an allocation of scheduled advertising time that is sold through its advertising business to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. In some cases, it works with representation firms as an extension of its sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to it. Cable Communications also represents the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. In addition, it generates revenue from the sale of advertising on its digital platforms. It also provides technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry, which allow advertisers to more effectively engage with their target audiences. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market, general economic conditions, and cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising.\nAdvertising revenue increased 14.1% in 2018 primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue. Advertising revenue decreased 6.7% in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue. Excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising increased 1.7% and 0.3% in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn 2018, 4% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments, compared to 5% in both 2017 and 2016. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.\nOther\nOther revenue primarily includes revenue related to residential customer late fees. We also receive revenue related to fees from other services, such as our security and automation services.\nOther revenue increased 7.9% and 5.2% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in revenue related to the licensing of our X1 platform to other multichannel video providers\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in revenue from our security and automation services\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cable Communications Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming Expenses\nProgramming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our video customers. These expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide.\nProgramming expenses increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in programming license fees, including retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in 2017 due to the timing of contract renewals\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may be at rates higher than those experienced recently, due to the timing of contract renewals in the future.\nTechnical and Product Support Expenses\nTechnical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning.\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTechnical and product support expenses increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased expenses related to the continued development, deployment and support of our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased expenses related to the continued growth in business services and security and automation services\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Customer Service Expenses\nCustomer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\nCustomer service expenses decreased in 2018 primarily due to lower personnel costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\nCustomer service expenses decreased slightly in 2017 primarily due to reduced call volume, which were partially offset by increased personnel costs.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion expenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion expenses were relatively flat in 2018 and 2017.\nFranchise and Other Regulatory Fees\nCable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities under the terms of our cable franchise agreements. Franchise and other regulatory fees decreased in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the revenue to which the fees apply. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the revenue to which the fees apply.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nOther operating costs and expenses increased in 2018 due to an increase in costs to support our advertising sales business. Other operating costs and expenses remained relatively flat in 2017.\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\nOur Cable Communications segment operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The most significant operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 2.7% and 11.5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We will continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, particularly residential high-speed internet and business services, and on overall operating cost management.\nOur Cable Communications segment operating margin was 40.7%, 39.7% and 39.6% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NBCUniversal Segments

networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties. Advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings and the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers, and the number of advertising units we can place in our broadcast networks' and owned local television stations' programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national and local advertising markets, general economic conditions, cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising, and the success and ratings of our programming.\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2017 to 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising, excluding 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, 2018 Super Bowl and 2016 Rio Olympics\n</td> <td>5,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdvertising revenue increased in 2018 primarily due to:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and 2018 Super Bowl\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase due to higher prices for advertising units sold\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the impact of continued declines in audience ratings\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Advertising revenue decreased in 2017 primarily due to:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the absence of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the impact of continued declines in audience ratings\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase due to higher prices for advertising units sold\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Content Licensing\nContent licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks, and to subscription video on demand services. In addition, our broadcast television studio production operations develop and produce original content that they license to broadcast networks, cable networks and local broadcast television stations owned by us and third parties, as well as to subscription video on demand services. The production and distribution costs related to our owned programming generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial network license, which means the subsequent licensing of our owned programming series following the initial network license is critical to their financial success.\nContent licensing revenue increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements.\nDistribution and Other\nWe generate distribution and other revenue primarily from fees for retransmission consent of our owned local broadcast television stations and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. The sale of our owned programming is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and therefore fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. Distribution and other revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games.\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2017 to 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution and other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution and other, excluding 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and 2016 Rio Olympics\n</td> <td>2,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistribution and other revenue increased in 2018 primarily due to:\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in revenue from our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Distribution and other revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to:\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decrease due to the absence of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Broadcast Television Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nProgramming and production costs relate to content that originates on our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, as well as owned content that is licensed to third parties.

Theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms.\nTheatrical revenue decreased in 2018 primarily due to the timing of releases and the strong performance of prior year releases, which were partially offset by successful releases in the current year.

Home entertainment revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our releases and their acceptance by consumers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases. The overall DVD market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the DVD format from increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distribution services and subscription rental services, both of which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales, as well as due to piracy.\nHome entertainment revenue decreased in 2018 primarily due to higher sales of 2017 releases in the prior year period, which were partially offset by sales of 2018 releases in the current year period.

Transactional revenue includes the purchase of physical and digital content, OTT daily, weekly and monthly passes, and pay-per-view programming.\nContent\nContent revenue is derived from the distribution of Sky's owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned programming to third-party video providers.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue is derived from the sale of advertising and sponsorships across Sky's owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels.\nSky Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nProgramming and production costs primarily relate to content originating on Sky's channels. These costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on-air talent costs. These expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties, which are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided.\nDirect Network Costs\nDirect network costs primarily include costs directly related to the supply of high-speed internet and voice services, including wireless phone services, to Sky's customers. This includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with our network. In addition, it includes the cost of mobile handsets sold to customers.\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther\nOther expenses include costs related to marketing, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2017 to 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n2016 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>3,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for legal settlement\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs\n</td> <td>(355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,545\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(61.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other -

It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>3,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other (income) loss, net\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>3,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>8,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>2,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating gains\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(442\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment for legal settlement\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities.

We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe also maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. See Note 7 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Comcast, NBCUniversal Enterprise and Sky revolving credit facilities and the related guarantees. As of December 31, 2018, amounts available under our consolidated revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit, totaled $9.2 billion, which included $0.9 billion available under the NBCUniversal Enterprise revolving credit facility and $0.7 billion available under the Sky revolving credit facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a 100% interest in Sky for total cash consideration of \u00a330.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). To finance the acquisition, we used funds from unsecured term loans and senior unsecured fixed and floating rate notes. The unsecured term loans and senior notes are guaranteed by Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. The remaining amount of consideration was funded using cash on hand. As of October 9, 2018, Sky had outstanding indebtedness that is now consolidated in our financial statements with an aggregate fair value of approximately $11.2 billion using the exchange rates as of such date, which is not guaranteed by us, Comcast Cable or NBCUniversal as of December 31, 2018.\nWe, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. The financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. We test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2018, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. We do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. In addition, the Sky revolving credit facility contains two financial covenants, a ratio of net debt to EBITDA and a ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable, as defined in the Sky credit facility. The Universal Studios Japan term loans also contain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2018, Sky and Universal Studios Japan were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and other operating gains\n</td> <td>10,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncash share-based compensation\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(1,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,404\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of interest\n</td> <td>(2,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,820\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments of income taxes\n</td> <td>(2,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from investments and other\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to the timing of film and television costs at Sky, our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and continued growth in our wireless phone service offering, partially offset by our broadcast of the 2018 Super Bowl.

This decrease was partially offset by higher taxable income from operations in the current year. The increase in income tax payments in 2017 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations and payments associated with tax disputes, partially offset by tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange and additional depreciation deductions allowed under the 2017 Tax Act.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, cash paid for capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and purchases of investments.

Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks.\nCash Paid for Intangible Assets\nIn 2018, cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of expenditures for software in our Cable Communication segment, and to a lesser extent, our NBCUniversal segment. Cash paid for intangible assets in 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of expenditures in our Cable Communications segment.\nAcquisitions and Construction of Real Estate Properties\nAcquisitions and construction of real estate properties in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily included the construction of the Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort in 2018 and 2017 primarily included costs related to the construction of the Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China.\nProceeds from Sales of Businesses and Investments\nProceeds from sales of businesses and investments in 2016 were primarily related to the sale of our investment in The Weather Channel's product and technology business.\nPurchases of Investments\nPurchases of investments in 2018 were primarily related to capital contributions to Atairos and NBCUniversal's capital contributions to Hulu. Purchases of investments in 2017 were primarily related to capital contributions to Atairos, our investment in Snap Inc. and NBCUniversal's capital contributions in Hulu. Purchases of investments in 2016 were primarily related to capital contributions to Atairos and NBCUniversal's investment in BuzzFeed, Inc.\nDeposits\nOn April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC\u201d) announced the results of its spectrum auction. In connection with the auction, we acquired the rights to $1.7 billion of spectrum. We had previously made a deposit of $1.8 billion to participate in the auction in 2016 and received a refund for amounts in excess of the purchase price in 2017.\nOther\nOther investing activities in 2018 were primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of an investment and proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts. Other investing activities in 2017 were primarily related to proceeds of $482 million received by NBCUniversal in the FCC auction for the relinquishment of spectrum rights (see Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 7 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings, including the financing of the Sky acquisition, which were partially offset by repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, and dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities in 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our repurchase program and employee plans, and dividend payments, which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions, including Sky in 2018, and debt repayments. Net cash used in financing activities in 2017 also included the purchase of the remaining 49% noncontrolling interests in Universal Studios Japan. Net cash used in financing activities in 2016 also included our purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Comcast Spectacor.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Note 7 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 6 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nIn 2018, we repurchased a total of 140 million shares of our Class A common stock for $5.0 billion under our share repurchase program authorization. Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to a total of $12.0 billion, which does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion remained under this authorization. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We plan to pause our common stock repurchase program in 2019 to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky.\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $3.5 billion in 2018. We paid dividends of $3.4 billion in 2018. In January 2019, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.84 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nThe chart below summarizes our share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, we paid $320 million, $435 million and $352 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share Repurchases Under Share Repurchase Program Authorization and Dividends Paid\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in billions)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2018 (in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>5,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(b)\n</td> <td>78,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(c)\n</td> <td>6,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(d)(e)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 7 and Note 17 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements.\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Excludes interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions.

We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the Sky transaction, one additional area has been identified as critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The one additional critical accounting judgment and estimate is the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. See Notes 4, 8 and 12 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items.\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Cable Franchise Rights\nOur cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States.\nWe have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but we assess their carrying values annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value ( impairment testing\u201d).\nFor the purpose of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.\nThe annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nIn 2018, we performed a quantitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. Based on this assessment, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the Northeast, Central and West divisions by 29%, 46% and 58%, respectively.\nSince the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights.\nWe could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. Assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights. In addition, a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nFilm and Television Costs\nWe capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period's revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources ( ultimate revenue\u201d). Estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. These estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production,\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\nWe capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own, including rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming, at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use. We amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. We generally amortize multiyear, live-event sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract.\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. If the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production's fair value. The fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nFair Value of Acquisition-Related Assets and Liabilities\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. Management's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. As part of the estimation process, third-party valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities.\nOur judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of acquired assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For instance, the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nDue to the timing of the Sky acquisition, the allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimates and is subject to change. Below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain of Sky's assets and liabilities for which preliminary estimates were determined. Other assets, such as property and equipment, have been recorded based on historical cost as no better estimate was available as of December 31, 2018.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finite-lived customer relationships, and indefinite-lived trade names.\nCustomer relationships were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about future events, including attrition, contract renewal estimates and technology changes.\nIn determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finite-lived intangibles, we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.\nTrade names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market assumptions, when available.", "summary": "The report covers Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of a global media and technology company.

\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to enhance the understanding of our operations and our present business environment. Components of the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section include:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measure \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates \n Overview \nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the NBCUniversal segments\u201d); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a 100% interest in Sky through a series of transactions, and Sky's results of operations for the period October 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018 are included in our consolidated results of operations. For more information about our company's operations, see Item 1: Business.\nWe adopted the updated accounting guidance related to revenue recognition on January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis, which required us to reflect the impact of the updated guidance for all periods presented (see Note 9 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\n \n\n\n \n 34 Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K \n (a) Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d section on page 54 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA.  2018 Developments\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2018:\nCable Communications Segment\n \u2022 An increase in revenue of 3.9% to $55.1 billion was primarily driven by increases in high-speed internet, business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by a decline in video and voice revenue \n \u2022 An increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 6.5% to $22.4 billion \n \u2022 An increase in operating margin from 39.7% to 40.7% that reflects increases in revenue from high-speed internet and business services, partially offset by higher programming expenses \n \u2022 A decrease in capital expenditures of 3.0% to $7.7 billion that reflects: \n \u25e6 decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital \n \u25e6 an increase in investments in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity \n \u25e6 an increase in investments in line extensions, primarily for the expansion of our business services  NBCUniversal Segments\n \u2022 An increase in total NBCUniversal revenue of 8.9% to $35.8 billion and an increase in total NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA of 4.6% to $8.6 billion, including the impact of our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and 2018 Super Bowl \n \u2022 An increase in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments revenue of 12.2% and 19.6%, respectively, including the impact of our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and 2018 Super Bowl; excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the 2018 Super Bowl, revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments increased 8.6% and 7.1%, respectively, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue \n \u2022 A decrease in Filmed Entertainment segment revenue of 5.8% reflecting lower home entertainment, theatrical, other and content licensing revenue \n \u2022 An increase in Theme Parks segment revenue of 4.4% reflecting higher guest spending, driven by increased ticket prices and merchandise, food and beverage spend, partially offset by the impact of inclement weather conditions and natural disasters in Japan  Sky Segment\n \u2022 We acquired Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 through a series of transactions with total cash consideration of \u00a330.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates) \n \u2022 For the period October 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018, Sky's total revenue was $4.6 billion and Adjusted EBITDA was $692 million  Corporate and Other\n \u2022 An increase in Corporate and Other revenue of 17.5% to $1.4 billion primarily due to revenue associated with our wireless phone service \n \u2022 An increase in Adjusted EBITDA losses of 12.6% to $1.5 billion primarily due to losses associated with our wireless phone service of $743 million \n \u2022 Cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $282 million; as of December 31, 2018, our total investment in Atairos is $2.7 billion \n \u2022 An effective tax rate of 22.2% and a reduction in income tax payments of $824 million primarily due to federal income tax overpayments related to the 2017 tax year that were applied to reduce tax payments in the current year, as well as a reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018 \n Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 35 \nCompetition\nThe results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information products and services to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming.\nFor additional information on the competition our businesses face, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the Competition\u201d discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively\u201d and Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\u201d\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations.

Capital expenditures increased in our Cable Communications segment as we continue to invest in network capacity and in customer premise equipment, primarily for our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways. Certain assets in our Cable Communications segment have relatively short estimated useful lives, which also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in 2018 and 2017 and will continue to increase depreciation expense in 2019. NBCUniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to our continued investment in new attractions in our Theme Parks segment,\n 38 Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K \nincluding for Universal Studios Japan. Sky depreciation and amortization expense is related primarily to property and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets.\nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $1.1 billion, $824 million and $790 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011, and 2018 included $267 million related to our preliminary estimates of Sky customer relationship intangible assets for the period October 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Amounts related to Sky are estimates and subject to change as we finalize acquisition accounting (see Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information).\nConsolidated Other Operating Gains\nConsolidated other operating gains for 2018 included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in Corporate and other and $141 million related to the sale of a business in our Filmed Entertainment segment (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements). Consolidated other operating gains for 2017 included $337 million related to NBCUniversal's relinquishment of spectrum rights (see Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 7 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements) and $105 million related to the sale of a business in Corporate and other (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements).\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding and financing costs resulting from the Sky transaction. Interest expense increased in 2017 primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding.\nConsolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net \nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net\nThe changes in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to our equity method investments in Atairos Group, Inc. and Hulu, LLC. Atairos, which commenced operations in 2016, follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. The losses at Hulu were driven by its higher programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. The table below summarizes the equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nRealized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net\nThe change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the adoption of updated accounting guidance for our marketable equity securities, which primarily relates to our investment in Snap (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 9 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net for 2018 and 2017 primarily included interest and dividend income.\nOther income (loss), net for 2016 included $225 million recognized in connection with the settlement of amounts owed to us under an agency agreement that had provided for, among other things, Verizon Wireless' sale of our cable services and $108 million related to the sale of our investment in The Weather Channel's product and technology business to IBM.\n Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 39 \n Consolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit \nIncome tax (expense) benefit reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate in 2018 was 22.2%, which included the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and also an income tax benefit of $128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018, which were partially offset by higher taxable income from operations and $148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. We recognized an income tax benefit of $244 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of Sky. See Note 5 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on tax reform.\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 49.3%. The enactment of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a net income tax benefit of $12.7 billion in 2017, primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 33.3%.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of $297 million in 2017. Our income tax benefit also increased $121 million due to the impact of an internal legal reorganization in the third quarter of 2017, which was partially offset by a decrease of $53 million due to changes in state tax laws. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 was an expense of 37.0%.\n Consolidated Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock \nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2018 was primarily due to the noncontrolling interest holders' share of the loss related to Universal Beijing Resort. In 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China and obtained a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort. See Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on noncontrolling interest related to Universal Beijing Resort. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2017 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interests in Universal Studios Japan that we did not already own in April 2017.\n Segment Operating Results \nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax benefit (expense), investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure. We reconcile the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nTo be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified within the Cable Communications segment and certain 2018, 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment.\n 40 Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K \n Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations \n\n \n\n Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 41 \n\nCustomer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. For multiple dwelling units ( MDUs\u201d), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video ( HD\u201d) or digital video recorder ( DVR\u201d) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. In 2017, we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of December 31, 2018 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 135,000 and 5,000, respectively. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. Single product, double product, and triple and quad product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three and four of our cable services, respectively.\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $153.95 and $152.70, respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship.\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $62.67 and $60.62, respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings.

Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming.\nFor additional information on the competition our businesses face, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the Competition\u201d discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively\u201d and Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\u201d\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations.

current year period and increases in capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for software, in our Cable Communications segment in recent years. Capital expenditures increased in our Cable Communications segment as we continue to invest in network capacity and in customer premise equipment, primarily for our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways. Certain assets in our Cable Communications segment have relatively short estimated useful lives, which also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense in 2018 and 2017 and will continue to increase depreciation expense in 2019. NBCUniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to our continued investment in new attractions in our Theme Parks segment,\n 38 Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K \nincluding for Universal Studios Japan. Sky depreciation and amortization expense is related primarily to property and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets.\nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $1.1 billion, $824 million and $790 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011, and 2018 included $267 million related to our preliminary estimates of Sky customer relationship intangible assets for the period October 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Amounts related to Sky are estimates and subject to change as we finalize acquisition accounting (see Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information).\nConsolidated Other Operating Gains\nConsolidated other operating gains for 2018 included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in Corporate and other and $141 million related to the sale of a business in our Filmed Entertainment segment (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements). Consolidated other operating gains for 2017 included $337 million related to NBCUniversal's relinquishment of spectrum rights (see Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 7 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements) and $105 million related to the sale of a business in Corporate and other (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements).\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding and financing costs resulting from the Sky transaction. Interest expense increased in 2017 primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding.\nConsolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Table 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (loss), net\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment and other income (loss), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(225\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net\nThe changes in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to our equity method investments in Atairos Group, Inc. and Hulu, LLC. Atairos, which commenced operations in 2016, follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. The losses at Hulu were driven by its higher programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. The table below summarizes the equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Atairos\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hulu\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRealized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net\nThe change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the adoption of updated accounting guidance for our marketable equity securities, which primarily relates to our investment in Snap (see Note 10 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and Note 9 to NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net for 2018 and 2017 primarily included interest and dividend income.\nOther income (loss), net for 2016 included $225 million recognized in connection with the settlement of amounts owed to us under an agency agreement that had provided for, among other things, Verizon Wireless' sale of our cable services and $108 million related to the sale of our investment in The Weather Channel's product and technology business to IBM.\n Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 39 \n Consolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit \nIncome tax (expense) benefit reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate in 2018 was 22.2%, which included the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and also an income tax benefit of $128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018, which were partially offset by higher taxable income from operations and $148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. We recognized an income tax benefit of $244 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of Sky. See Note 5 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on tax reform.\nOur effective income tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 49.3%. The enactment of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a net income tax benefit of $12.7 billion in 2017, primarily related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 33.3%.\nAdditionally, in 2017, we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of $297 million in 2017. Our income tax benefit also increased $121 million due to the impact of an internal legal reorganization in the third quarter of 2017, which was partially offset by a decrease of $53 million due to changes in state tax laws. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 was an expense of 37.0%.\n Consolidated Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock \nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2018 was primarily due to the noncontrolling interest holders' share of the loss related to Universal Beijing Resort. In 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China and obtained a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort. See Note 8 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements for further discussion on noncontrolling interest related to Universal Beijing Resort. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2017 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interests in Universal Studios Japan that we did not already own in April 2017.\n Segment Operating Results \nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax benefit (expense), investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure. We reconcile the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to Comcast's consolidated financial statements and NBCUniversal's consolidated financial statements).\nTo be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified within the Cable Communications segment and certain 2018, 2017 and 2016 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. For multiple dwelling units ( MDUs\u201d), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video ( HD\u201d) or digital video recorder ( DVR\u201d) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. In 2017, we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of December 31, 2018 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 135,000 and 5,000, respectively. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. Single product, double product, and triple and quad product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three and four of our cable services, respectively.\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $153.95 and $152.70, respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship.\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for 2018 and 2017 was $62.67 and $60.62, respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this"}
