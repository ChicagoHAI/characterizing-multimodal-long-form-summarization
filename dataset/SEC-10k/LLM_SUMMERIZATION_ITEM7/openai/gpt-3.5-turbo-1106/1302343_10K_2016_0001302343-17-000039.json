Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the risk factors included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a self-managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of high-quality collegiate housing communities. We also provide collegiate housing management and development consulting services to universities, charitable foundations and other third parties. We believe that we are one of the largest private owners, developers and managers of high-quality collegiate housing communities in the United States in terms of total beds both owned and under management.\nWe earn revenue from rental payments we receive as a result of our ownership of collegiate housing communities. We also earn revenue by performing property management services and development consulting services for third parties through our Management Company and our Development Company, respectively.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nOur Business Segments\nWe define business segments by their distinct customer base and the service provided. Management has identified three reportable segments: collegiate housing leasing, development consulting services and management services. We evaluate each segment's performance based on net operating income, which is defined as income before depreciation, amortization, ground leases, impairment losses, interest expense (income), gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCollegiate housing leasing\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue represented 97.9% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnlike multi-family housing where apartments are leased by the unit, collegiate-housing communities are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis. Individual lease liability limits each resident's liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate's rent. The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units occupied. A parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income and/or pays a deposit, which is usually equal to two months rent.\nDue to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations and individual lease liability, the high level of student-oriented amenities and the fact that most units are furnished and typically rent includes utilities, cable television and internet service, we\nbelieve our communities in most cases can command higher per-unit and per-square foot rental rates than most multi-family communities in the same geographic markets. We are also typically able to command higher rental rates than other on-campus collegiate housing, which tends to offer fewer amenities.\nThe majority of our leases commence in mid-August of each year and terminate the last day of July of each year. These dates generally coincide with the commencement of the universities' fall academic term and the completion of the subsequent summer school session. As such, we are required to re-lease each community in its entirety each year, resulting in significant turnover in our resident population from year to year. For the 2016-2017 leasing cycle and the 2015-2016 cycle, approximately 77.9% and 74.3%, respectively, of our beds were leased to students who were first-time residents at our communities. As a result, we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in October and ends in August of each year. Our communities' occupancy rates are therefore typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year.\nPrior to the commencement of each new lease period, primarily during the first two weeks of August, but also during September at some communities, we prepare the units for new incoming residents. Other than revenue generated by in-place leases for renewing residents, we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as Turn,\u201d as we have no leases in place. In addition, we incur significant expenses during Turn to make our units ready for occupancy. These expenses are recognized when incurred. This Turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year. In addition, several of our properties (University Towers, The Berk, University Village on Colvin and all UK properties) operate under an eight or nine month lease. During certain periods in the summer months, no rent revenue is recognized, resulting in seasonality in our operating results during that time.\nDevelopment consulting services\nIn 2016, revenue from our development consulting services represented 0.8% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide development consulting services primarily to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus collegiate housing communities, to other third-party investors and to our collegiate housing leasing segment in order to develop communities for our ownership. Our development consulting services typically include the following:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market analysis and evaluation of collegiate housing needs and options;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cooperation with college or university in architectural design;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>negotiation of ground lease, development agreement, construction contract, architectural contract and bond documents;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>oversight of architectural design process;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>coordination of governmental and university plan approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>oversight of construction process;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>design, purchase and installation of furniture;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pre-opening marketing to students; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtaining final approvals of construction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFees for these services are typically 3 - 5% of the total cost of a project and are payable over the life of the construction period, which in most cases is one to two years in length. Occasionally, the development consulting contracts include a provision whereby we can participate in project savings resulting from successful cost management efforts. These revenues are recognized once all contractual terms have been satisfied and no future performance requirements exist. This typically occurs after construction is complete. As part of the development agreements, there are certain costs we pay on behalf of universities or third-party investors. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the universities or third-party investors. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our development consulting services business.\nManagement services\nIn 2016, revenue from our management services segment represented 1.3% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions, charitable foundations, ourselves and others. Our management services typically cover all aspects of community operations, including residence life and student development, marketing, leasing administration, strategic relationships, information systems and accounting services. We provide these services pursuant to multi-year management agreements under which management fees are typically 3 - 5% of leasing revenue. These agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of like terms. As part of the management agreements, there are certain payroll and related expenses we pay on behalf of the property owners. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the property owners. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our management services business.\nTrends and Outlook\nRents and occupancy\nWe manage our communities to maximize revenues, which are primarily driven by two components: rental rates and occupancy. We customarily adjust rental rates in order to maximize revenues, which in some cases results in lower occupancy, but in most cases results in stable or increasing revenue from the community. As a result, a decrease in occupancy may be offset by an increase in rental rates and may not be material to our operations. Periodically, certain of our markets experience increases in new on-campus collegiate housing provided by colleges and universities and off-campus collegiate housing provided by private owners. This additional collegiate housing both on- and off-campus can create competitive pressure on rental rates and occupancy.\nAfter three consecutive years of declining new supply, we currently anticipate the volume of new supply in our markets to be greater in 2017 than it was in 2016. However, the rate of new supply is projected to exceed enrollment growth by only 30 basis points. This difference is consistent with what we experienced over the last four years, during which we averaged 3.8% annual increases in same-community revenue. We believe these results are reflective of both the quality of our portfolio, which includes communities that are generally newer and better-located than other collegiate housing communities in our markets, as well as the modernization that continues to occur our the industry. We do not believe that the growth characteristics of our well-located portfolio, which has produced a compounded annual revenue growth of 3.6% over the last six years, has changed significantly.\nWe define our same-community portfolio as properties that were owned and operating for the full year as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and are not conducting substantial development or redevelopment activities and were not sold during the respective periods. During 2016, we sold three properties, which are excluded from same-community results (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nOur community occupancy rates are typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year. Management reviews both occupancy and rate per occupied bed to assess markets and, combined, overall revenue growth. In 2016, same-community revenue per occupied bed increased to $803 and same-community physical occupancy increased to 91.2%, compared to same-community revenue per occupied bed of $775 and same-community physical occupancy of 91.8% in 2015. The results represent averages across the same-community portfolio, which are not necessarily indicative of every community in the portfolio. Individual communities can and do perform both above and below these averages, and, at times, an individual community may experience a decline in total revenue due to changes in local university student housing policies and economic conditions. Our management focus is to assess these situations and address them quickly in an effort to minimize the exposure and reverse any negative trends.\nThe same-community leasing portfolio opened the 2016-2017 lease term with a 2.3% increase in rental revenue. Opening occupancy was down 111 basis points to 96.7% and net rental rates opened the term 3.4% above the prior year. New-communities opened the 2016-2017 lease term with an average occupancy of 88.8%.\nNorth Carolina State University announced a requirement that all freshmen live on campus beginning in September 2017. This announcement will likely negatively impact leasing of our University Towers collegiate housing property beginning with the 2017/2018 lease year as the beds have historically been primarily leased to freshmen. We will continue to monitor the impact of\nthis change in university policy, as it could negatively impact the property's results of operations and the valuation of the property.\nDevelopment consulting services\nThird-party development consulting services\nIn 2016 and 2015, third-party development revenue was $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. In recent years, we have had approximately two to three third-party development consulting projects per year. As more universities are turning toward private industry to fund and own new collegiate housing projects, we expect to see an increase in equity deals and future third-party fee volume to remain around these levels. We recently delivered third-party projects at Clarion University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley. We are currently providing third-party development services with a project under construction at East Stroudsburg University - Pennsylvania Phase II, Texas A&M - Commerce and Shepherd University with delivery targeted for the summer of 2017.\nONE PlanSM developments\nWe develop collegiate housing communities on- and off-campus for our ownership, which we expect to be a significant part of our external growth going forward. The ONE PlanSM is our private equity program that allows universities to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects. This program is designed to provide our equity to solve a university's housing needs through a ground lease structure where we typically own the land improvements and operate the community. Others in the industry have similar programs and to date we have 16 ONE PlanSM projects representing 21 communities completed or underway. In December 2011, we were selected by the University of Kentucky (\"UK\") to negotiate the potential revitalization of UK's entire campus housing portfolio and expansion of UK's campus housing portfolio to more than 9,000 beds within five to seven years. We refer to this project as the UK Campus Housing Revitalization Plan. To date, we have delivered 5,733 beds for $348.3 million of development costs in the four phases at UK. Construction on the 2017 deliveries is on-track to deliver 1,117 beds for a total cost of $101.0 million. We view our entry into the partnership with UK as a defining moment, not only for EdR, but also for our industry. Most state universities face many of the same challenges as UK, including reduced support from constrained state budgets, aging on-campus housing and demands on institutional funds for academic and support services. We believe declining state support for higher education will continue to be the norm rather than the exception. These external factors provide a great opportunity for the Trust. As universities see the progress of the UK Campus Revitalization Plan, the volume of discussions we are having with other universities continues to increase as they investigate this type of structure to replace their aging on-campus housing stock.\nWhile considering the possible shift in the types of projects universities pursue, the amount and timing of future revenue from development consulting services will be contingent upon our ability to successfully compete in public colleges and universities' competitive procurement processes, our ability to successfully structure financing of these projects and our ability to ensure completion of construction within committed timelines and budgets. To date, we have completed construction on all of our development consulting projects in time for their targeted occupancy dates.\nCollegiate housing operating costs\nIn 2015, 2014, and 2013, same-community operating expenses increased 5.0%, 2.6%, and 4.2%, respectively. In 2016, same-community operating expenses increased approximately 2.6%. This increase was mainly driven by higher real estate taxes. We expect full year same-community operating expenses to increase between 3.0-4.0% going forward, which we believe is a reasonable level of growth for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes costs such as payroll, home office rent, training, professional and legal fees and other public company costs. Costs directly associated with the management of our owned portfolio along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in collegiate housing leasing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nCosts directly associated with our management and development services along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in development and management services on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nUnallocated general and administrative costs in 2016 were $10.4 million (excluding development pursuit costs and acquisition costs of $1.2 million), an increase of $1.4 million, or 16%, when compared to 2015. This increase during 2016 is consistent with our growth in assets and revenue and allows us to appropriately prepare for future growth, including our announced development pipeline. While we expect general and administrative costs to continue with double digit increases, we expect our growth rate to moderate going forward.\nAsset repositioning and capital recycling\nSince 2009, we have acquired $1.2 billion of collegiate housing communities, completed $832.7 million of developments and disposed of $486.9 million of collegiate housing communities. Starting in 2010, we made a concerted effort to reposition and improve our owned portfolio with a significant part of the process completed prior to 2013. These transactions have improved our median distance to campus to 0.1 miles and increased our average rental rate to $801. Currently, 83% of our beds and 88% of our community NOI are located on or pedestrian to campus.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of five collegiate housing properties for $287.1 million, resulting in an increase to our portfolio of 1,737 beds. We also sold three housing communities consisting of 1,728 beds for a combined gross sales price of $96.6 million. The Trust received net proceeds of $95.0 million after deducting closing costs and recognized a $24.0 million gain on these dispositions.\nIn January and February 2017, we acquired the following collegiate housing properties:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contract Price (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Retreat at Corvallis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oregon State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>319 Bragg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Auburn University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the fall of 2016, we completed the following development projects (dollars in thousands):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project\n</td> <td>Project Type\n</td> <td>Bed Count\n</td> <td>Total Project Development Cost Upon Opening\n</td> <td>EdR's Ownership Percentage\n</td> <td>EdR's Share of Development Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University of Kentucky - Holmes Hall and Boyd Hall\n</td> <td>ONE Plan\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia Tech - Retreat at Blacksburg - Phases I & II\n</td> <td>Wholly Owned (1)\n</td> <td>829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75%\n</td> <td>48,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University of Mississippi - Retreat at Oxford - Phase II\n</td> <td>Wholly Owned\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>26,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total - August 2016 Delivered Communities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The Retreat at Blacksburg was initially a joint venture.

In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue recognition\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue is comprised of all revenues related to the leasing activities at our collegiate housing communities and includes revenues from leasing apartments by the bed, food services, parking space rentals and certain ancillary services.\nStudents are required to execute lease contracts with payment schedules that vary from per semester to monthly. Generally, a parental guarantee must accompany each executed contract. Receivables are recorded when due, while leasing revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts.\nCollegiate housing property acquisitions and dispositions\nLand, land improvements, buildings and improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 15 to 40 years, land improvements are depreciated over 15 years and furniture, fixtures, and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 7 years. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.\nResults of operations for acquired collegiate housing communities are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. Appraisals, estimates of cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land, land improvements, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangibles such as amounts related to in-place leases.\nManagement assesses impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset based on its intended use to determine whether the carrying value is recoverable. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Management estimates fair value using discounted cash flow models, market appraisals if available, and other market participant data.\nWhen a collegiate housing community has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the fair value less cost to sell such asset is estimated. Based on past experience, we consider the sale of an asset to be probable and that the plan to sell the asset will not be withdrawn once a non-refundable deposit has been received, which typically occurs at the end of a due diligence period, thus triggering held for sale classification. If fair value less cost to sell the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the estimated loss. Depreciation expense is no longer recorded once a collegiate housing community has met the held for sale criteria. Operations of collegiate housing communities that are sold or classified as held for sale were recorded as part of discontinued operations prior to January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 related to the presentation of discontinued operations. Prospectively, only dispositions that represent a strategic shift in our business will qualify for treatment as discontinued operations. The property dispositions in 2015 and 2016 did not qualify for treatment as discontinued operations and, as a result, the operations of the properties are included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nRepairs and maintenance\nThe costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred. Major improvements that extend the life of an asset beyond one year are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed.\nUse of estimates\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the recognition of third-party development consulting revenue under the percentage of completion method, useful lives of collegiate housing assets, the initial valuations and underlying allocations of purchase price in connection with collegiate housing property acquisitions, and the determination of fair value for impairment assessments and derivative valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe review our assets, including our collegiate housing communities and communities under development for potential impairment indicators whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, declines in our market capitalization, overall market factors, changes in cash flows, significant decreases in net operating income and occupancies at our operating properties, changes in projected completion dates of our development projects and sustainability of development projects. Our tests for impairment are based on the most current information available and if conditions change or if our plans regarding our assets change, it could result in additional impairment charges in the future. However, based on our plans with respect to our operating properties and those under development, we believe the carrying amounts are recoverable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December

At the beginning of each calendar year, the same-community portfolio mix changes when all properties owned and managed for the entire previous calendar year are moved into the same-community portfolio. The increase from the 2015 acquisitions and deliveries relates to a full 12 months of revenue recognized in the current year compared to a shorter period in prior year. In 2016, we recognized revenue on the 2016 acquisitions and deliveries, with no revenue on these properties recognized in the prior year. Revenue on the sold-communities is reflected up to the point of sale of the respective property.\nSame-community operating expenses increased $2.3 million, or 2.6%, over prior year and is mainly due to increased rates in real estate taxes, increased maintenance and repair costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses.We also experienced an increase in operating expenses related to 2015 and 2016 acquisitions and developments, offset by a decrease in operating expenses on sold-communities of $4.6 million.\nDevelopment consulting services\nThe following table represents the development consulting revenue recognized by project for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable (Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clarion University of Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East Stroudsburg University - Pennsylvania Ph II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Athens - Georgia Heights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wichita State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bowles Hall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shepherd University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas A&M - Commerce\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southeastern Louisiana University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pre-development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchasing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchasing fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party development consulting services total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThird-party development consulting services revenue increased $0.1 million to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Third-party development consulting services revenue fluctuates based on the number and timing of development projects. There were no revenues associated with cost savings for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the segment decreased $0.8 million, or 27.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the the same period in the prior year. Gross general and administrative expenses generally fluctuate based on the number and timing of development projects, both owned and third-party. This decrease in general and administrative expenses allocated to third-party development consulting services is correlated to the increase in the volume of owned developments, and thus a lower allocation of costs to third-party development consulting services.\nManagement services\nTotal management services revenue decreased $0.1 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to the lost revenue from properties we no longer manage.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for our management services segment decreased $0.5 million, or 18.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease correlates to the decrease in the number of managed communities over the prior year and is partially due to the continued growth of our owned portfolio and the a reduction in general and administrative expenses allocated to third-party management services.\nOther unallocated general and administrative expenses\nOther unallocated general and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million, or 17.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 over the same period in the prior year. The increase includes approximately $0.7 million in acquisition and development pursuit costs, with the remainder related primarily to payroll costs as a result of growth in our portfolio and increased on- and off- campus development pursuit activity.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $13.4 million, or 19.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase relates primarily to 16 new communities (acquisitions or developments placed in service) opened since January 1, 2015, partially offset by sold communities. Additionally, $2.9 million of accelerated depreciation was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the change in estimated useful life due to the redevelopment of Players Club (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $3.9 million of amortization of in-place leases related to the 2016 acquisitions (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nGround lease expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of ground leases increased $1.2 million, or 10.6%, compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase relates primarily to the opening of three new communities in 2015 for which a full 12 months of expense is included in 2016 results and two new communities in 2016 on the campus of the University of Kentucky. Except for ground leases that are structured as purely contingent rent, we recognize ground lease expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the related ground lease.\nLoss on impairment of collegiate housing properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment losses of $2.5 million related to collegiate housing communities. One asset was determined to be impaired due to a change in circumstances that indicated its carrying value may not be recoverable (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded no impairment losses.\nNonoperating expenses\nNonoperating expenses consist of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>(1,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>(10,611\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonoperating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,728\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal nonoperating expenses increased $0.6 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.2 million represents costs incurred in connection with the payoff of $183.9 million of mortgage debt (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) offset by a $9.0 million decrease in interest expense over prior year directly related to the payoff of mortgage and construction debt during 2015 and 2016.\nResults of

At the beginning of each calendar year, the same-community portfolio mix changes when all properties owned and managed for the entire previous calendar year are moved into the same-community portfolio. The increase from the 2014 acquisitions and deliveries relates to a full 12 months of revenue recognized in the current year compared to a shorter period in the prior year. In 2015, we recognized revenue on the 2015 acquisitions and deliveries, with no revenue on these properties recognized in the prior year. Revenue on the sold-communities is reflected up to the point of sale of the respective property.\nSame-community operating expenses increased $5.3 million, or 6.9%, over the prior year, mainly due to increased rates in real estate taxes and a $0.8 million real estate charge relating to the settlement of an assessment dispute with a local school board at one community covering several prior assessment years. We also experienced an increase in operating expenses related to the 2014 and 2015 acquisitions and developments, offset by a decrease in operating expenses on sold-communities of $8.5 million.\nDevelopment consulting services\nThe following table represents the development consulting revenue recognized by project for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable (Unfavorable)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clarion University of Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Chester University of Pennsylvania - Phase II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Athens - Georgia Heights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mansfield University of Pennsylvania Phase II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wichita State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bowles Hall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous consulting fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development Consulting fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party development consulting services total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThird-party development consulting services revenue decreased $2.0 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Third-party development consulting services revenue fluctuates based on the number and timing of development projects.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the segment increased $0.4 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. General and administrative expenses generally fluctuate based on the number and timing of development projects; however, a portion of general and administrative expenses are incurred prior to the commencement of\nconstruction of the development as they include such costs necessary to propose, negotiate and structure the third-party development deals.\nManagement services\nTotal management services revenue decreased $0.3 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease is due primarily to the lost revenue from properties we no longer manage.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for our management services segment increased $0.2 million, or 8.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to general inflation-related increases.\nOther unallocated general and administrative expenses\nOther unallocated general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 over the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to general inflation-related increases.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $9.0 million, or 15.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase relates primarily to the 17 new properties (acquisitions or developments) opened since January 1, 2014.\nGround lease expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the cost of ground leases increased $2.3 million, or 25.4%, compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase relates primarily to the opening of eight communities on the campus of the University of Kentucky in 2014 and 2015. Except for ground leases that are structured as purely contingent rent, we recognize ground lease expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the related ground lease.\nLoss on impairment of collegiate housing properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded impairment losses of $12.7 million related to collegiate housing communities. The assets were determined to be impaired due to a change in circumstances that indicated their carrying values may not be recoverable (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The change in circumstances for the properties was generally attributable to changes in property-specific market conditions, changes in anticipated future use and/or leasing results or a combination of these factors. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded no impairment losses.\nNonoperating expenses\nNonoperating expenses consist of the following for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>(2,089\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantee fee income from Participating Development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on loan to Participating Development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>(403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on insurance settlement\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonoperating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,728\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $3.8 million, or 18.4%, to $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense includes approximately $10.3 million of additional expense related to the Unsecured Senior Notes issued during November 2014 (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), offset by a decrease in interest\nexpense on mortgage and construction related debt of $5.5 million due to the prepayment of mortgage and construction debt during the year.\nThe $3.0 million guarantee fee income from Participating Development was recognized in the third quarter of 2014 when the guaranteed debt was repaid by the owner of the project. The $6.5 million of interest on loan to Participating Development recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents interest income on the $18.0 million mezzanine loan advanced by us, which was previously deferred due to continuing involvement in the Johns Hopkins development (see further discussion above and Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $3.5 million represents costs incurred in connection with the early retirement of $190.1 million of mortgage and construction debt in 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we settled the insurance claims related to the July 2012 fire at 3949 Lindell, and recognized a gain of $8.1 million (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash flows\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $34.5 million of cash on hand compared to $33.7 million of cash on hand as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2016, we generated $132.6 million of cash from operations compared to $99.9 million in 2015. This increase of $32.7 million is primarily attributable to the increase in combined community net operating income of $23.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $525.5 million of cash in investing activities compared to $246.8 million over the same period in 2015. This increase in cash used for investing activities of $278.8 million is attributable primarily to the following:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash used to acquire collegiate housing properties of $209.5 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash spent on development activities of $147.5 million, partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash generated from the disposition of collegiate housing properties of $82.6 million (three dispositions in 2016 and one in 2015).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $393.6 million of cash from financing activities compared to $162.2 million during the same period in 2015.

We generally expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through existing cash provided by operations, draws on our revolving credit facility or other new debt, debt refinancing, recycling capital through potential asset sales and equity market activity, including sales of EdR common stock under our ATM Program or Forward Agreements. We believe that these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our short-term capital needs. We have managed our balance sheet so that all capital needs, including announced and committed development deals, are pre-funded by our balance sheet capacity. During November 2014, we obtained investment grade credit ratings and completed our inaugural public offering of Unsecured Senior Notes, as further discussed below. We will continue to monitor both the debt and equity markets and in the future anticipate accessing capital through our at-the-market equity offering program, additional follow on equity offerings or additional public offerings of unsecured notes.\nIn November 2015, we completed a follow-on equity offering selling 8.1 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $270.1 million. This offering, and a subsequent offering in January 2016, where we sold an additional 6.3 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $215.1 million, improved our leverage metrics and provided additional balance sheet capacity to fund our current development pipeline and future acquisitions and development opportunities.\nThe Operating Partnership used $85.1 million of the proceeds from the January 2016 follow-on equity offering to prepay the two remaining notes under the secured credit facility with Fannie Mae (the \"Master Secured Credit Facility\"). One of the notes prepaid had a principal balance of $21.3 million at December 31, 2015, was set to mature on January 1, 2020 and had a fixed interest rate of 5.67%. The second note prepaid had a principal balance of $54.5 million, was set to mature on January 1, 2019 and had a fixed interest rate of 6.02%. The Operating Partnership incurred prepayment penalties of $9.3 million in connection with the prepayment of these notes. In addition, the Operating Partnership repaid in full fixed-rate mortgage debt of $22.3 million that was collateralized by The Centre at Overton Park collegiate housing community. The interest rate was equal to 5.60% and the mortgage debt was scheduled to mature on January 1, 2017.\nOn June 30, 2016, the Operating Partnership repaid in full variable rate construction debt with an outstanding principal balance of $35.7 million related to the development of The Retreat at Louisville. The effective interest rate at the repayment date was 2.5% and the loan was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2017. On September 27, 2016, the Operating Partnership repaid in full variable rate construction debt with an outstanding principal balance of $49.3 million related to the development of The Retreat at Blacksburg. The effective interest rate at the repayment date was 2.6% and the loan was scheduled to mature on February 4, 2019.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership repaid in full variable rate mortgage debt with an outstanding principal balance of $33.0 million secured by the University Towers collegiate housing community. The loan was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2017.\nDistributions for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $103.4 million, or $1.50 per share to our stockholders and $0.5 million, or $1.50 per OP Unit, to the limited partners in the Operating Partnership, compared to cash provided by operations of $132.6 million, or $1.81 per weighted average share/unit.\nBased on our closing share price of $42.30 on December 31, 2016, our total enterprise value was $3.6 billion. With net debt (total debt less cash) of $485.6 million as of December 31, 2016, our debt to enterprise value was 13.5% compared to 22% as of December 31, 2015. With gross assets of $2.8 billion, which excludes accumulated depreciation of $311.1 million, our debt to gross assets ratio was 18.5% as of December 31, 2016 as compared to 28.3% as of December 31, 2015.\nATM Program\nDuring October 2014, the Trust entered into equity distribution agreements to establish an at-the-market equity offering program (\"ATM Program\") whereby EdR was authorized to sell a maximum of $150.0 million in shares of its common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold approximately 2.3 million, 0.7 million and 0.5 million shares pursuant the ATM Program, and received net proceeds of $93.5 million, $26.7 million and $18.1 million, respectively, which exhausted the ATM Program. The Trust used the net proceeds to repay debt, fund our development pipeline and for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 2, 2016, the Trust entered into equity distribution agreements to establish a new ATM Program whereby EdR was authorized to sell a maximum of $300.0 million in shares of its common stock. The Trust sold approximately 7.0 million shares under these distribution agreements during the year ended December 31, 2016 and received net proceeds of approximately $296.2 million, which exhausted this $300.0 million ATM Program.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Trust entered into equity distribution agreements to establish a new ATM Program whereby EdR is authorized to sell a maximum of $300.0 million in shares of its common stock. Under these agreements, EdR may make sales of common stock through at-the-market transactions or pursuant to the Forward Agreements. In connection with any Forward Agreement, the relevant forward purchaser will borrow from third parties, and through the relevant sales agent, sell a number of shares of EdR common stock underlying the particular Forward Agreement. The Trust does not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Trust entered into six Forward Agreements to sell an aggregate of 6.8 million shares of EdR common stock at a weighted average initial forward price of $42.77 per share, net of offering fees and discounts. The final sales price and proceeds to be received by the Trust from the sales under each Forward Agreement will be determined on the applicable date of settlement, with adjustments during the term of the contract for dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the federal funds rate. The Trust generally has the\nability to determine the dates and method of settlement, subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. The Trust currently expects to fully physically settle each Forward Agreement on one or more dates specified by the Trust prior to the maturity date of the applicable Forward Agreement, in which case the Trust will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares of common stock underlying the applicable Forward Agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Trust may also elect, in its discretion, to cash settle or net share settle a particular Forward Agreement, in which case the Trust may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and the Trust may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of EdR common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant counterparty. Settlement of each Forward Agreement currently in place will occur on one or more dates not later than December 29, 2017. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the accounting treatment of the Forward Agreements.\nRevolving credit facility\nAs described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on November 19, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amended Revolver\u201d), which has a maximum availability of $500.0 million and an accordion feature to $1.0 billion. The Fifth Amended Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and financial covenants, including restrictions on distributions. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants and had availability of $480.0 million as $20.0 million was outstanding. The interest rate applicable to the Fifth Amended Revolver was 1.90% at December 31, 2016. As of February 28, 2017, $245.0 million had been drawn on the Fifth Amended Revolver, and we had remaining availability of $255.0 million.\nUnsecured term loan facility\nOn January 13, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into an unsecured term loan facility, which was subsequently amended and restated on November 19, 2014 (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), at which time EROP became the sole borrower. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), the unsecured term loans have an aggregate principal amount of $187.5 million (with an accordion feature to $250.0 million), consisting of a $122.5 million Tranche A term loan with a seven-year maturity and a $65.0 million Tranche B term loan with a five-year maturity (collectively, the Term Loans\u201d).\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants substantially similar to those contained in the Fifth Amended Revolver. EdR serves as the guarantor for any funds borrowed by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, the Operating Partnership entered into multiple interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $187.5 million to hedge the interest payments on the LIBOR-based Term Loans (see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2016, the effective interest rate on the Tranche A term loan was 3.85% (weighted average swap rate of 2.30% plus the current margin of 1.55%) and the effective interest rate on the Tranche B term loan was 2.86% (weighted average swap rate of 1.66% plus the current margin of 1.20%).\nOn January 18, 2017, the Operating Partnership entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d). The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated that certain First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 19, 2014 (the Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Term Loan Facility solely (i) to lower the interest rate on the $187.5 million Tranche A term loan under the Term Loan Facility by 35 basis points from LIBOR plus a margin range from 155 to 225 basis points to LIBOR plus a margin a range of 120 basis points to 190 basis points, and (ii) to extend the maturity of the $65 million Tranche B term loan under the Term Loan Facility from January 13, 2019 to January 18, 2022. The provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are otherwise identical to the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We also entered into a forward starting interest rate swap concurrently with the extension of the Tranche B term loan.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nOn November 24, 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the public offering of $250.0 million unsecured senior notes (the \"Unsecured Senior Notes\") (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The 10-year Unsecured Senior Notes were issued at 99.991% of par value with a coupon of 4.6% per annum and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by EdR. Interest on the Unsecured Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year,\nwith the first payment beginning on June 15, 2015. The Unsecured Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024. Net proceeds from the sale of the Unsecured Senior Notes were approximately $247.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by the Operating Partnership. The terms of Unsecured Senior Notes contain certain covenants that restrict the ability of the Trust and the Operating Partnership to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. In addition, the Operating Partnership must maintain a minimum ratio of unencumbered asset value to unsecured debt, as well as minimum interest coverage level. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAcquisition, disposition and development activity\nAn additional source of capital, subject to appropriate market conditions, is the targeted disposition of non-strategic properties. We continually assess all of our communities, the markets in which they are located and the colleges and universities they serve, to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate. The net proceeds from the sale of any asset would provide additional capital that would most likely be used to pay down debt and possibly finance acquisition/development growth or other operational needs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold the 605 West collegiate housing community located in Durham, North Carolina, which serves Duke University, The Reserve at Athens located in Athens, Georgia, which serves the University of Georgia, and The Commons at Tallahassee located in Tallahassee, Florida, which serves Florida State University. These three communities were sold for a combined gross sales price of approximately $96.6 million (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). We received combined net proceeds of approximately $95.0 million after deducting closing costs and recognized a $24.0 million gain on these dispositions as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2015, we sold Cape Trails collegiate housing community located in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, serving Southeast Missouri State University, for a sales price of $12.9 million. The Trust received proceeds of $12.3 million after closing costs and recognized a $2.8 million gain on this disposition as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2015. This property was built in 2000, acquired by the Trust in 2005 and was 0.1 miles from campus.\nWe intend to invest in additional communities only as suitable opportunities arise. We also plan to develop communities for our ownership and management. In the short term, we intend to fund any acquisitions or developments with cash on hand, working capital, borrowings under construction loans, our Fifth Amended Revolver or secured debt. We intend to finance property acquisitions and development projects over the longer term with cash from operations, the proceeds from potential asset sales, additional issuances of common or preferred stock, private capital in the form of joint ventures, debt financing or issuances of OP Units. There can be no assurance, however, that such funding will be obtained on reasonable terms, or at all.\nDuring January 2017, we completed an acquisition of The Retreat at Corvallis, serving Oregon State University. This 1,016-bed community was purchased at a contract price of $99.5 million. During February 2017, we also completed an acquisition of 319 Bragg, serving Auburn University. This 305-bed community was purchased at a contract price of $28.5 million.\nDuring 2016, we completed the following collegiate housing property acquisitions:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contract Price\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lokal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University, Colorado\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Hub at Madison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pura Vida Place\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University, Colorado\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carriage House\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Colorado State University, Colorado\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urbane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Arizona, Arizona\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, we completed the following collegiate housing property acquisitions:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contract Price\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Commons on Bridge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Tennessee\nKnoxville, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Province at Boulder\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>University of Colorado\nBoulder, Colorado\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently have thirteen active development projects that we are developing for our ownership with our share of aggregate development costs of $948.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, $233.2 million of the anticipated costs had been incurred and funded.\nPredevelopment expenditures\nOur third-party development consulting activities have historically required us to fund predevelopment expenditures such as architectural fees, permits and deposits. Because the closing of a development project's financing is often subject to third-party delay, we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities. We frequently incur these predevelopment expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and, accordingly, bear the risk of the loss of these predevelopment expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms. However, we typically obtain a guarantee of repayment of these predevelopment expenditures from the project owner, but no assurance can be given that we would be successful in collecting the amount guaranteed in the event that project financing is not obtained. When we develop projects for ownership, as opposed to our third-party development services, the Trust bears all exposure to risks and capital requirements for these developments.\nLong-term liquidity requirements\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary for scheduled debt maturities, distributions, acquisitions, developments, renovations and other non-recurring capital expenditures that are needed periodically for our communities. We expect to meet these needs through working capital, cash provided by operations, additional borrowings under our Fifth Amended Revolver, net proceeds from potential asset sales, the issuance of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, OP Units or additional debt, if market conditions permit.\nCapital expenditures\nThe historical recurring capital expenditures, excluding sold communities, at our same communities are set forth as follows: Table 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of and for the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total units\n</td> <td>9,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total beds\n</td> <td>24,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recurring capital expenditures (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average per unit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>510.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>595.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average per bed\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecurring capital expenditures exclude capital spending on significant renovations, community repositioning or other major periodic projects. Capital expenditures associated with newly developed communities are typically capitalized as part of their development costs. As a result, such communities typically require little to no recurring capital expenditures until their second year of operation or later.\nAdditionally, we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute contractual amounts annually to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at the mortgaged communities. These contributions are typically less than, but could exceed, the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred during any given year at such communities.\nNonrecurring capital expenditures were approximately $18.0 million, $9.5 million and $12.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. These expenditures relate to major renovations and improvements and typically are funded with cash on hand.\nCommitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, excluding the Fifth Amended Revolver which matures in 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Interest Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>19,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease and Future Purchase Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>17,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Reserve Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development Projects (5)\n</td> <td>379,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>479,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>676,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,845,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes required monthly principal amortization and amounts due at maturity on first mortgage debt secured by collegiate housing properties and any amounts due under the Term Loan, Unsecured Senior Notes and construction loan agreements.

The Fifth Amended Revolver matures on November 19, 2018, and provides that EROP may extend the maturity date by one year subject to certain conditions. The Fifth Amended Revolver requires interest-only payments through maturity. The interest rate per annum applicable to the Fifth Amended Revolver is, at EROP's option, equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our leverage. The interest rate applicable to the Fifth Amended Revolver as of December 31, 2016 was 1.90%.\nDistributions\nWe are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gains) on an annual basis in order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock and OP Units. All such distributions are authorized at the sole discretion of the Board. We may be required to use borrowings under our Fifth Amended Revolver, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements, avoid the imposition of federal income and excise taxes and maintain our REIT status. Additionally, we may make certain distributions consisting of both cash and shares to meet REIT distribution requirements. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. During May 2016, the Board increased the annual dividend target from $1.48 to $1.52 per share to our stockholders and per OP Unit to the Operating Partnership unitholders becoming effective with the August 15, 2016 dividend.\nDuring 2016, we declared quarterly distributions aggregating $1.50 per share of EdR's common stock and per OP Unit in EROP.\nAs discussed above, the Board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.38 per share of common stock and OP Unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The distributions were paid on February 15, 2017 to stockholders and unitholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Operating Partnership and various joint venture partners have jointly and severally guaranteed partial repayment on third-party mortgage and construction debt secured by certain underlying collegiate housing properties, all of which are held by unconsolidated joint ventures. The Operating Partnership is liable to the lender for any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation incurred by the lender arising out of or in connection with certain non-recourse exceptions in connection with the debt. Pursuant to the respective operating agreement, the joint venture partner agreed to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Trust with respect to such obligations, except to the extent such obligations were caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of the Operating Partnership or its employees, agents or affiliates. Therefore, exposure under the guaranties for obligations not caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of the Operating Partnership or its employees, agents or affiliates are not expected to exceed the Operating Partnership's proportionate interest in the related mortgage debt in the case of the non-recourse, carve-out guaranty, or in the Operating Partnership's proportionate interest in the partial repayment guaranty, as applicable.

The Operating Partnership and LeylandAlliance LLC jointly committed to provide a guarantee of repayment for the construction loan. As of December 31, 2016, $36.8 million had been drawn on the construction loan, of which $7.2 million was attributable to LeylandAlliance LLC, and has not been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nFunds From Operations (FFO)\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of collegiate housing assets and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We present FFO available to all stockholders and unitholders because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. As such, we also exclude the impact of noncontrolling interests, only as it relates to OP Units, in our calculation. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from collegiate housing asset dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and by the October 2011 guidance described above), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Further, FFO does not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO available to stockholders and unitholders. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash\nflow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.\nWe also use core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") as an operating performance measure. Core FFO available to stockholders and unitholders is defined as FFO adjusted to include the economic impact of revenue on participating projects for which recognition is deferred for GAAP purposes. The adjustment for this revenue is calculated on the same percentage of completion method used to recognize revenue on third-party development projects. Core FFO also includes adjustments to exclude the impact of straight-line adjustments for ground leases, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, transaction costs and noncash fair value adjustments, and severance costs. We believe that these adjustments are appropriate in determining Core FFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In addition, management uses Core FFO in the assessment of our operating performance and comparison to its industry peers and believes that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing our results to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of FFO and Core FFO available to our stockholders and unitholders to net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Education Realty Trust, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of collegiate housing assets\n</td> <td>(23,956\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on insurance settlement\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairment of collegiate housing assets\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate related depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>79,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity portion of real estate depreciation and amortization on equity investees\n</td> <td>2,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>701\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO available to stockholders and unitholders\n</td> <td>105,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>10,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance costs, net of tax\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line adjustment for ground leases\n</td> <td>4,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO adjustments\n</td> <td>17,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO on Participating Developments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on loan to Participating Development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development fees on Participating Development, net of costs and taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO on Participating Developments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO available to stockholders and unitholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nWe believe NOI is a useful measure of our collegiate housing operating performance. We define NOI as rental and other community-level revenues earned from our collegiate housing communities less community-level operating expenses, excluding third-party management fees and expenses, third-party development consulting fees and expenses, depreciation, amortization, other operating expenses related to noncash adjustments, ground lease expense and impairment charges and including regional and other corporate costs of supporting the communities. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate performance on a community-by-community basis because it allows management to evaluate the impact that factors such as\nlease structure, lease rates and resident base, which vary by property, have on our operating results.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the risk factors included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a self-managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of high-quality collegiate housing communities. We also provide collegiate housing management and development consulting services to universities, charitable foundations and other third parties. We believe that we are one of the largest private owners, developers and managers of high-quality collegiate housing communities in the United States in terms of total beds both owned and under management.\nWe earn revenue from rental payments we receive as a result of our ownership of collegiate housing communities. We also earn revenue by performing property management services and development consulting services for third parties through our Management Company and our Development Company, respectively.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nOur Business Segments\nWe define business segments by their distinct customer base and the service provided. Management has identified three reportable segments: collegiate housing leasing, development consulting services and management services. We evaluate each segment's performance based on net operating income, which is defined as income before depreciation, amortization, ground leases, impairment losses, interest expense (income), gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCollegiate housing leasing\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue represented 97.9% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnlike multi-family housing where apartments are leased by the unit, collegiate-housing communities are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis. Individual lease liability limits each resident's liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate's rent. The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units occupied. A parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income and/or pays a deposit, which is usually equal to two months rent.\nDue to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations and individual lease liability, the high level of student-oriented amenities and the fact that most units are furnished and typically rent includes utilities, cable television and internet service, we\nbelieve our communities in most cases can command higher per-unit and per-square foot rental rates than most multi-family communities in the same geographic markets. We are also typically able to command higher rental rates than other on-campus collegiate housing, which tends to offer fewer amenities.\nThe majority of our leases commence in mid-August of each year and terminate the last day of July of each year. These dates generally coincide with the commencement of the universities' fall academic term and the completion of the subsequent summer school session. As such, we are required to re-lease each community in its entirety each year, resulting in significant turnover in our resident population from year to year. For the 2016-2017 leasing cycle and the 2015-2016 cycle, approximately 77.9% and 74.3%, respectively, of our beds were leased to students who were first-time residents at our communities. As a result, we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in October and ends in August of each year. Our communities' occupancy rates are therefore typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year.\nPrior to the commencement of each new lease period, primarily during the first two weeks of August, but also during September at some communities, we prepare the units for new incoming residents. Other than revenue generated by in-place leases for renewing residents, we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as Turn,\u201d as we have no leases in place. In addition, we incur significant expenses during Turn to make our units ready for occupancy. These expenses are recognized when incurred. This Turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year. In addition, several of our properties (University Towers, The Berk, University Village on Colvin and all UK properties) operate under an eight or nine month lease. During certain periods in the summer months, no rent revenue is recognized, resulting in seasonality in our operating results during that time.\nDevelopment consulting services\nIn 2016, revenue from our development consulting services represented 0.8% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide development consulting services primarily to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus collegiate housing communities, to other third-party investors and to our collegiate housing leasing segment in order to develop communities for our ownership. Our development consulting services typically include the following:\n \u2022 market analysis and evaluation of collegiate housing needs and options; \n \u2022 cooperation with college or university in architectural design; \n \u2022 negotiation of ground lease, development agreement, construction contract, architectural contract and bond documents; \n \u2022 oversight of architectural design process; \n \u2022 coordination of governmental and university plan approvals; \n \u2022 oversight of construction process; \n \u2022 design, purchase and installation of furniture; \n \u2022 pre-opening marketing to students; and \n \u2022 obtaining final approvals of construction. \nFees for these services are typically 3 - 5% of the total cost of a project and are payable over the life of the construction period, which in most cases is one to two years in length. Occasionally, the development consulting contracts include a provision whereby we can participate in project savings resulting from successful cost management efforts. These revenues are recognized once all contractual terms have been satisfied and no future performance requirements exist. This typically occurs after construction is complete. As part of the development agreements, there are certain costs we pay on behalf of universities or third-party investors. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the universities or third-party investors. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our development consulting services business.\nManagement services\nIn 2016, revenue from our management services segment represented 1.3% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions, charitable foundations, ourselves and others. Our management services typically cover all aspects of community operations, including residence life and student development, marketing, leasing administration, strategic relationships, information systems and accounting services. We provide these services pursuant to multi-year management agreements under which management fees are typically 3 - 5% of leasing revenue. These agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of like terms. As part of the management agreements, there are certain payroll and related expenses we pay on behalf of the property owners. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the property owners. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our management services business.\nTrends and Outlook\nRents and occupancy\nWe manage our communities to maximize revenues, which are primarily driven by two components: rental rates and occupancy. We customarily adjust rental rates in order to maximize revenues, which in some cases results in lower occupancy, but in most cases results in stable or increasing revenue from the community. As a result, a decrease in occupancy may be offset by an increase in rental rates and may not be material to our operations. Periodically, certain of our markets experience increases in new on-campus collegiate housing provided by colleges and universities and off-campus collegiate housing provided by private owners. This additional collegiate housing both on- and off-campus can create competitive pressure on rental rates and occupancy.\nAfter three consecutive years of declining new supply, we currently anticipate the volume of new supply in our markets to be greater in 2017 than it was in 2016. However, the rate of new supply is projected to exceed enrollment growth by only 30 basis points. This difference is consistent with what we experienced over the last four years, during which we averaged 3.8% annual increases in same-community revenue. We believe these results are reflective of both the quality of our portfolio, which includes communities that are generally newer and better-located than other collegiate housing communities in our markets, as well as the modernization that continues to occur our the industry. We do not believe that the growth characteristics of our well-located portfolio, which has produced a compounded annual revenue growth of 3.6% over the last six years, has changed significantly.\nWe define our same-community portfolio as properties that were owned and operating for the full year as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and are not conducting substantial development or redevelopment activities and were not sold during the respective periods. During 2016, we sold three properties, which are excluded from same-community results (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nOur community occupancy rates are typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year. Management reviews both occupancy and rate per occupied bed to assess markets and, combined, overall revenue growth. In 2016, same-community revenue per occupied bed increased to $803 and same-community physical occupancy increased to 91.2%, compared to same-community revenue per occupied bed of $775 and same-community physical occupancy of 91.8% in 2015. The results represent averages across the same-community portfolio, which are not necessarily indicative of every community in the portfolio. Individual communities can and do perform both above and below these averages, and, at times, an individual community may experience a decline in total revenue due to changes in local university student housing policies and economic conditions. Our management focus is to assess these situations and address them quickly in an effort to minimize the exposure and reverse any negative trends.\nThe same-community leasing portfolio opened the 2016-2017 lease term with a 2.3% increase in rental revenue. Opening occupancy was down 111 basis points to 96.7% and net rental rates opened the term 3.4% above the prior year. New-communities opened the 2016-2017 lease term with an average occupancy of 88.8%.\nNorth Carolina State University announced a requirement that all freshmen live on campus beginning in September 2017. This announcement will likely negatively impact leasing of our University Towers collegiate housing property beginning with the 2017/2018 lease year as the beds have historically been primarily leased to freshmen. We will continue to monitor the impact of\nthis change in university policy, as it could negatively impact the property's results of operations and the valuation of the property.\nDevelopment consulting services\nThird-party development consulting services\nIn 2016 and 2015, third-party development revenue was $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. In recent years, we have had approximately two to three third-party development consulting projects per year. As more universities are turning toward private industry to fund and own new collegiate housing projects, we expect to see an increase in equity deals and future third-party fee volume to remain around these levels. We recently delivered third-party projects at Clarion University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley. We are currently providing third-party development services with a project under construction at East Stroudsburg University - Pennsylvania Phase II, Texas A&M - Commerce and Shepherd University with delivery targeted for the summer of 2017.\nONE PlanSM developments\nWe develop collegiate housing communities on- and off-campus for our ownership, which we expect to be a significant part of our external growth going forward. The ONE PlanSM is our private equity program that allows universities to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects. This program is designed to provide our equity to solve a university's housing needs through a ground lease structure where we typically own the land improvements and operate the community. Others in the industry have similar programs and to date we have 16 ONE PlanSM projects representing 21 communities completed or underway. In December 2011, we were selected by the University of Kentucky (\"UK\") to negotiate the potential revitalization of UK's entire campus housing portfolio and expansion of UK's campus housing portfolio to more than 9,000 beds within five to seven years. We refer to this project as the UK Campus Housing Revitalization Plan. To date, we have delivered 5,733 beds for $348.3 million of development costs in the four phases at UK. Construction on the 2017 deliveries is on-track to deliver 1,117 beds for a total cost of $101.0 million. We view our entry into the partnership with UK as a defining moment, not only for EdR, but also for our industry. Most state universities face many of the same challenges as UK, including reduced support from constrained state budgets, aging on-campus housing and demands on institutional funds for academic and support services. We believe declining state support for higher education will continue to be the norm rather than the exception. These external factors provide a great opportunity for the Trust. As universities see the progress of the UK Campus Revitalization Plan, the volume of discussions we are having with other universities continues to increase as they investigate this type of structure to replace their aging on-campus housing stock.\nWhile considering the possible shift in the types of projects universities pursue, the amount and timing of future revenue from development consulting services will be contingent upon our ability to successfully compete in public colleges and universities' competitive procurement processes, our ability to successfully structure financing of these projects and our ability to ensure completion of construction within committed timelines and budgets. To date, we have completed construction on all of our development consulting projects in time for their targeted occupancy dates.\nCollegiate housing operating costs\nIn 2015, 2014, and 2013, same-community operating expenses increased 5.0%, 2.6%, and 4.2%, respectively. In 2016, same-community operating expenses increased approximately 2.6%. This increase was mainly driven by higher real estate taxes. We expect full year same-community operating expenses to increase between 3.0-4.0% going forward, which we believe is a reasonable level of growth for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes costs such as payroll, home office rent, training, professional and legal fees and other public company costs. Costs directly associated with the management of our owned portfolio along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in collegiate housing leasing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nCosts directly associated with our management and development services along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in development and management services on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nUnallocated general and administrative costs in 2016 were $10.4 million (excluding development pursuit costs and acquisition costs of $1.2 million), an increase of $1.4 million, or 16%, when compared to 2015. This increase during 2016 is consistent with our growth in assets and revenue and allows us to appropriately prepare for future growth, including our announced development pipeline. While we expect general and administrative costs to continue with double digit increases, we expect our growth rate to moderate going forward.\nAsset repositioning and capital recycling\nSince 2009, we have acquired $1.2 billion of collegiate housing communities, completed $832.7 million of developments and disposed of $486.9 million of collegiate housing communities. Starting in 2010, we made a concerted effort to reposition and improve our owned portfolio with a significant part of the process completed prior to 2013. These transactions have improved our median distance to campus to 0.1 miles and increased our average rental rate to $801. Currently, 83% of our beds and 88% of our community NOI are located on or pedestrian to campus.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of five collegiate housing properties for $287.1 million, resulting in an increase to our portfolio of 1,737 beds. We also sold three housing communities consisting of 1,728 beds for a combined gross sales price of $96.6 million. The Trust received net proceeds of $95.0 million after deducting closing costs and recognized a $24.0 million gain on these dispositions.\nIn January and February 2017, we acquired the following collegiate housing properties:\n\nIn the fall of 2016, we completed the following development projects (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)The Retreat at Blacksburg was initially a joint venture. During September 2016, we purchased our partner's 25% ownership interest in the property.\nThe community at Virginia Tech is located within walking distance from campus, the community at the University of Mississippi is less than one mile from campus and the communities at the University of Kentucky are located directly on campus (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nWe continue to add to the size and quality of our portfolio with new developments. Construction is proceeding as expected on the following 2017, 2018 and 2019 deliveries (dollars in thousands): \n(1) Represents estimates that are subject to change as the development process proceeds.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue recognition\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue is comprised of all revenues related to the leasing activities at our collegiate housing communities and includes revenues from leasing apartments by the bed, food services, parking space rentals and certain ancillary services.\nStudents are required to execute lease contracts with payment schedules that vary from per semester to monthly. Generally, a parental guarantee must accompany each executed contract. Receivables are recorded when due, while leasing revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts.\nCollegiate housing property acquisitions and dispositions\nLand, land improvements, buildings and improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 15 to 40 years, land improvements are depreciated over 15 years and furniture, fixtures, and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 7 years. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.\nResults of operations for acquired collegiate housing communities are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. Appraisals, estimates of cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land, land improvements, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangibles such as amounts related to in-place leases.\nManagement assesses impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset based on its intended use to determine whether the carrying value is recoverable. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Management estimates fair value using discounted cash flow models, market appraisals if available, and other market participant data.\nWhen a collegiate housing community has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the fair value less cost to sell such asset is estimated. Based on past experience, we consider the sale of an asset to be probable and that the plan to sell the asset will not be withdrawn once a non-refundable deposit has been received, which typically occurs at the end of a due diligence period, thus triggering held for sale classification. If fair value less cost to sell the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the estimated loss. Depreciation expense is no longer recorded once a collegiate housing community has met the held for sale criteria. Operations of collegiate housing communities that are sold or classified as held for sale were recorded as part of discontinued operations prior to January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 related to the presentation of discontinued operations. Prospectively, only dispositions that represent a strategic shift in our business will qualify for treatment as discontinued operations. The property dispositions in 2015 and 2016 did not qualify for treatment as discontinued operations and, as a result, the operations of the properties are included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nRepairs and maintenance\nThe costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred. Major improvements that extend the life of an asset beyond one year are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed.\nUse of estimates\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the recognition of third-party development consulting revenue under the percentage of completion method, useful lives of collegiate housing assets, the initial valuations and underlying allocations of purchase price in connection with collegiate housing property acquisitions, and the determination of fair value for impairment assessments and derivative valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe review our assets, including our collegiate housing communities and communities under development for potential impairment indicators whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, declines in our market capitalization, overall market factors, changes in cash flows, significant decreases in net operating income and occupancies at our operating properties, changes in projected completion dates of our development projects and sustainability of development projects. Our tests for impairment are based on the most current information available and if conditions change or if our plans regarding our assets change, it could result in additional impairment charges in the future. However, based on our plans with respect to our operating properties and those under development, we believe the carrying amounts are recoverable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results from the perspective of our management. Our MD&A is presented in ten sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Our Business Segments \n \u2022 Trends and Outlook \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Distributions \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Measures \n \u2022 Inflation \nOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the risk factors included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a self-managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of high-quality collegiate housing communities. We also provide collegiate housing management and development consulting services to universities, charitable foundations and other third parties. We believe that we are one of the largest private owners, developers and managers of high-quality collegiate housing communities in the United States in terms of total beds both owned and under management.\nWe earn revenue from rental payments we receive as a result of our ownership of collegiate housing communities. We also earn revenue by performing property management services and development consulting services for third parties through our Management Company and our Development Company, respectively.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nOur Business Segments\nWe define business segments by their distinct customer base and the service provided. Management has identified three reportable segments: collegiate housing leasing, development consulting services and management services. We evaluate each segment's performance based on net operating income, which is defined as income before depreciation, amortization, ground leases, impairment losses, interest expense (income), gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCollegiate housing leasing\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue represented 97.9% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnlike multi-family housing where apartments are leased by the unit, collegiate-housing communities are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis. Individual lease liability limits each resident's liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate's rent. The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units occupied. A parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income and/or pays a deposit, which is usually equal to two months rent.\nDue to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations and individual lease liability, the high level of student-oriented amenities and the fact that most units are furnished and typically rent includes utilities, cable television and internet service, we\nbelieve our communities in most cases can command higher per-unit and per-square foot rental rates than most multi-family communities in the same geographic markets. We are also typically able to command higher rental rates than other on-campus collegiate housing, which tends to offer fewer amenities.\nThe majority of our leases commence in mid-August of each year and terminate the last day of July of each year. These dates generally coincide with the commencement of the universities' fall academic term and the completion of the subsequent summer school session. As such, we are required to re-lease each community in its entirety each year, resulting in significant turnover in our resident population from year to year. For the 2016-2017 leasing cycle and the 2015-2016 cycle, approximately 77.9% and 74.3%, respectively, of our beds were leased to students who were first-time residents at our communities. As a result, we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in October and ends in August of each year. Our communities' occupancy rates are therefore typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year.\nPrior to the commencement of each new lease period, primarily during the first two weeks of August, but also during September at some communities, we prepare the units for new incoming residents. Other than revenue generated by in-place leases for renewing residents, we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as Turn,\u201d as we have no leases in place. In addition, we incur significant expenses during Turn to make our units ready for occupancy. These expenses are recognized when incurred. This Turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year. In addition, several of our properties (University Towers, The Berk, University Village on Colvin and all UK properties) operate under an eight or nine month lease. During certain periods in the summer months, no rent revenue is recognized, resulting in seasonality in our operating results during that time.\nDevelopment consulting services\nIn 2016, revenue from our development consulting services represented 0.8% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide development consulting services primarily to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus collegiate housing communities, to other third-party investors and to our collegiate housing leasing segment in order to develop communities for our ownership. Our development consulting services typically include the following:\n \u2022 market analysis and evaluation of collegiate housing needs and options; \n \u2022 cooperation with college or university in architectural design; \n \u2022 negotiation of ground lease, development agreement, construction contract, architectural contract and bond documents; \n \u2022 oversight of architectural design process; \n \u2022 coordination of governmental and university plan approvals; \n \u2022 oversight of construction process; \n \u2022 design, purchase and installation of furniture; \n \u2022 pre-opening marketing to students; and \n \u2022 obtaining final approvals of construction. \nFees for these services are typically 3 - 5% of the total cost of a project and are payable over the life of the construction period, which in most cases is one to two years in length. Occasionally, the development consulting contracts include a provision whereby we can participate in project savings resulting from successful cost management efforts. These revenues are recognized once all contractual terms have been satisfied and no future performance requirements exist. This typically occurs after construction is complete. As part of the development agreements, there are certain costs we pay on behalf of universities or third-party investors. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the universities or third-party investors. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our development consulting services business.\nManagement services\nIn 2016, revenue from our management services segment represented 1.3% of our total revenues, excluding operating expense reimbursements and other adjustments/eliminations included in our segment reporting. We provide management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions, charitable foundations, ourselves and others. Our management services typically cover all aspects of community operations, including residence life and student development, marketing, leasing administration, strategic relationships, information systems and accounting services. We provide these services pursuant to multi-year management agreements under which management fees are typically 3 - 5% of leasing revenue. These agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of like terms. As part of the management agreements, there are certain payroll and related expenses we pay on behalf of the property owners. These costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the property owners. We recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred. These operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our management services business.\nTrends and Outlook\nRents and occupancy\nWe manage our communities to maximize revenues, which are primarily driven by two components: rental rates and occupancy. We customarily adjust rental rates in order to maximize revenues, which in some cases results in lower occupancy, but in most cases results in stable or increasing revenue from the community. As a result, a decrease in occupancy may be offset by an increase in rental rates and may not be material to our operations. Periodically, certain of our markets experience increases in new on-campus collegiate housing provided by colleges and universities and off-campus collegiate housing provided by private owners. This additional collegiate housing both on- and off-campus can create competitive pressure on rental rates and occupancy.\nAfter three consecutive years of declining new supply, we currently anticipate the volume of new supply in our markets to be greater in 2017 than it was in 2016. However, the rate of new supply is projected to exceed enrollment growth by only 30 basis points. This difference is consistent with what we experienced over the last four years, during which we averaged 3.8% annual increases in same-community revenue. We believe these results are reflective of both the quality of our portfolio, which includes communities that are generally newer and better-located than other collegiate housing communities in our markets, as well as the modernization that continues to occur our the industry. We do not believe that the growth characteristics of our well-located portfolio, which has produced a compounded annual revenue growth of 3.6% over the last six years, has changed significantly.\nWe define our same-community portfolio as properties that were owned and operating for the full year as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and are not conducting substantial development or redevelopment activities and were not sold during the respective periods. During 2016, we sold three properties, which are excluded from same-community results (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nOur community occupancy rates are typically stable during the August to July academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year. Management reviews both occupancy and rate per occupied bed to assess markets and, combined, overall revenue growth. In 2016, same-community revenue per occupied bed increased to $803 and same-community physical occupancy increased to 91.2%, compared to same-community revenue per occupied bed of $775 and same-community physical occupancy of 91.8% in 2015. The results represent averages across the same-community portfolio, which are not necessarily indicative of every community in the portfolio. Individual communities can and do perform both above and below these averages, and, at times, an individual community may experience a decline in total revenue due to changes in local university student housing policies and economic conditions. Our management focus is to assess these situations and address them quickly in an effort to minimize the exposure and reverse any negative trends.\nThe same-community leasing portfolio opened the 2016-2017 lease term with a 2.3% increase in rental revenue. Opening occupancy was down 111 basis points to 96.7% and net rental rates opened the term 3.4% above the prior year. New-communities opened the 2016-2017 lease term with an average occupancy of 88.8%.\nNorth Carolina State University announced a requirement that all freshmen live on campus beginning in September 2017. This announcement will likely negatively impact leasing of our University Towers collegiate housing property beginning with the 2017/2018 lease year as the beds have historically been primarily leased to freshmen. We will continue to monitor the impact of\nthis change in university policy, as it could negatively impact the property's results of operations and the valuation of the property.\nDevelopment consulting services\nThird-party development consulting services\nIn 2016 and 2015, third-party development revenue was $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. In recent years, we have had approximately two to three third-party development consulting projects per year. As more universities are turning toward private industry to fund and own new collegiate housing projects, we expect to see an increase in equity deals and future third-party fee volume to remain around these levels. We recently delivered third-party projects at Clarion University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley. We are currently providing third-party development services with a project under construction at East Stroudsburg University - Pennsylvania Phase II, Texas A&M - Commerce and Shepherd University with delivery targeted for the summer of 2017.\nONE PlanSM developments\nWe develop collegiate housing communities on- and off-campus for our ownership, which we expect to be a significant part of our external growth going forward. The ONE PlanSM is our private equity program that allows universities to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects. This program is designed to provide our equity to solve a university's housing needs through a ground lease structure where we typically own the land improvements and operate the community. Others in the industry have similar programs and to date we have 16 ONE PlanSM projects representing 21 communities completed or underway. In December 2011, we were selected by the University of Kentucky (\"UK\") to negotiate the potential revitalization of UK's entire campus housing portfolio and expansion of UK's campus housing portfolio to more than 9,000 beds within five to seven years. We refer to this project as the UK Campus Housing Revitalization Plan. To date, we have delivered 5,733 beds for $348.3 million of development costs in the four phases at UK. Construction on the 2017 deliveries is on-track to deliver 1,117 beds for a total cost of $101.0 million. We view our entry into the partnership with UK as a defining moment, not only for EdR, but also for our industry. Most state universities face many of the same challenges as UK, including reduced support from constrained state budgets, aging on-campus housing and demands on institutional funds for academic and support services. We believe declining state support for higher education will continue to be the norm rather than the exception. These external factors provide a great opportunity for the Trust. As universities see the progress of the UK Campus Revitalization Plan, the volume of discussions we are having with other universities continues to increase as they investigate this type of structure to replace their aging on-campus housing stock.\nWhile considering the possible shift in the types of projects universities pursue, the amount and timing of future revenue from development consulting services will be contingent upon our ability to successfully compete in public colleges and universities' competitive procurement processes, our ability to successfully structure financing of these projects and our ability to ensure completion of construction within committed timelines and budgets. To date, we have completed construction on all of our development consulting projects in time for their targeted occupancy dates.\nCollegiate housing operating costs\nIn 2015, 2014, and 2013, same-community operating expenses increased 5.0%, 2.6%, and 4.2%, respectively. In 2016, same-community operating expenses increased approximately 2.6%. This increase was mainly driven by higher real estate taxes. We expect full year same-community operating expenses to increase between 3.0-4.0% going forward, which we believe is a reasonable level of growth for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative costs\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes costs such as payroll, home office rent, training, professional and legal fees and other public company costs. Costs directly associated with the management of our owned portfolio along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in collegiate housing leasing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nCosts directly associated with our management and development services along with allocated corporate general and administrative expenses based the extent of effort or resources expended are presented in development and management services on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nUnallocated general and administrative costs in 2016 were $10.4 million (excluding development pursuit costs and acquisition costs of $1.2 million), an increase of $1.4 million, or 16%, when compared to 2015.

While we expect general and administrative costs to continue with double digit increases, we expect our growth rate to moderate going forward.\nAsset repositioning and capital recycling\nSince 2009, we have acquired $1.2 billion of collegiate housing communities, completed $832.7 million of developments and disposed of $486.9 million of collegiate housing communities. Starting in 2010, we made a concerted effort to reposition and improve our owned portfolio with a significant part of the process completed prior to 2013. These transactions have improved our median distance to campus to 0.1 miles and increased our average rental rate to $801. Currently, 83% of our beds and 88% of our community NOI are located on or pedestrian to campus.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of five collegiate housing properties for $287.1 million, resulting in an increase to our portfolio of 1,737 beds. We also sold three housing communities consisting of 1,728 beds for a combined gross sales price of $96.6 million. The Trust received net proceeds of $95.0 million after deducting closing costs and recognized a $24.0 million gain on these dispositions.\nIn January and February 2017, we acquired the following collegiate housing properties:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary University Served\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Beds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Contract Price (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Retreat at Corvallis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oregon State University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>319 Bragg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Auburn University\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the fall of 2016, we completed the following development projects (dollars in thousands):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Project\n</td> <td>Project Type\n</td> <td>Bed Count\n</td> <td>Total Project Development Cost Upon Opening\n</td> <td>EdR's Ownership Percentage\n</td> <td>EdR's Share of Development Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University of Kentucky - Holmes Hall and Boyd Hall\n</td> <td>ONE Plan\n</td> <td>1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia Tech - Retreat at Blacksburg - Phases I & II\n</td> <td>Wholly Owned (1)\n</td> <td>829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75%\n</td> <td>48,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>University of Mississippi - Retreat at Oxford - Phase II\n</td> <td>Wholly Owned\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>26,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total - August 2016 Delivered Communities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The Retreat at Blacksburg was initially a joint venture.

In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized all available information, including its past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized. Application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies.\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue recognition\nCollegiate housing leasing revenue is comprised of all revenues related to the leasing activities at our collegiate housing communities and includes revenues from leasing apartments by the bed, food services, parking space rentals and certain ancillary services.\nStudents are required to execute lease contracts with payment schedules that vary from per semester to monthly. Generally, a parental guarantee must accompany each executed contract. Receivables are recorded when due, while leasing revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts.\nCollegiate housing property acquisitions and dispositions\nLand, land improvements, buildings and improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over 15 to 40 years, land improvements are depreciated over 15 years and furniture, fixtures, and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 7 years. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.\nResults of operations for acquired collegiate housing communities are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. Appraisals, estimates of cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land, land improvements, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangibles such as amounts related to in-place leases.\nManagement assesses impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset based on its intended use to determine whether the carrying value is recoverable. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Management estimates fair value using discounted cash flow models, market appraisals if available, and other market participant data.\nWhen a collegiate housing community has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the fair value less cost to sell such asset is estimated. Based on past experience, we consider the sale of an asset to be probable and that the plan to sell the asset will not be withdrawn once a non-refundable deposit has been received, which typically occurs at the end of a due diligence period, thus triggering held for sale classification. If fair value less cost to sell the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the estimated loss. Depreciation expense is no longer recorded once a collegiate housing community has met the held for sale criteria. Operations of collegiate housing communities that are sold or classified as held for sale were recorded as part of discontinued operations prior to January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 related to the presentation of discontinued operations. Prospectively, only dispositions that represent a strategic shift in our business will qualify for treatment as discontinued operations. The property dispositions in 2015 and 2016 did not qualify for treatment as discontinued operations and, as a result, the operations of the properties are included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nRepairs and maintenance\nThe costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred. Major improvements that extend the life of an asset beyond one year are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Planned major repair, maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed.\nUse of estimates\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the recognition of third-party development consulting revenue under the percentage of completion method, useful lives of collegiate housing assets, the initial valuations and underlying allocations of purchase price in connection with collegiate housing property acquisitions, and the determination of fair value for impairment assessments and derivative valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe review our assets, including our collegiate housing communities and communities under development for potential impairment indicators whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, declines in our market capitalization, overall market factors, changes in cash flows, significant decreases in net operating income and occupancies at our operating properties, changes in projected completion dates of our development projects and sustainability of development projects. Our tests for impairment are based on the most current information available and if conditions change or if our plans regarding our assets change, it could result in additional impairment charges in the future. However, based on our plans with respect to our operating properties and those under development, we believe the carrying amounts are recoverable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collegiate Housing Leasing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Collegiate housing leasing revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Collegiate housing leasing operations\n</td> <td>111,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development Consulting Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Third-party development consulting services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>General and administrative(1)\n</td> <td>2,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(758\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
