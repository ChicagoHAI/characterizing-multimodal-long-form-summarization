Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and other information included elsewhere in this Report, including risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report.\nPerformance Indicators\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows. These key performance indicators include:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>total revenue, which is an indicator of our overall business growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>subscriber growth and churn rate, which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long-term, high-value customers.

This increase was due primarily to a $9.0 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our average subscriber base and increases in ARPU. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $2.6 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from a lower volume of Simplex and Duplex units sold during 2016.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>38,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>10,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Service Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>5,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>3,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equipment Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue.

During 2015, gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated primarily from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present ARPU for other service revenue in the table above. Effective April 1, 2016, we began reclassifying activations fees with the service revenue to which they relate.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased 16% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU compared to 2015. The average Duplex subscriber base increased 5% and ARPU increased 11% in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher ARPU was due primarily to increased revenue from annual, usage-based plans and price increases. In early 2015, we reduced the selling price of our phones and launched various promotions, resulting in an increase in the popularity of our annual, usage-based plans. These plans resulted in higher service revenue recognized during 2016 related to the 2015 promotions where unused minutes expire on the anniversary date of the customer's contract. We also increased prices for certain of our legacy rate plans during 2016 to align our rate plans with our service levels and prospective rate plans for future products.\nSPOT service revenue increased 14% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU. The average number of SPOT subscribers increased 7% and ARPU increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015. The ARPU increase was driven primarily by rate plan increases and the nearly 43,000 SPOT Gen3TM activations during 2016. We sell SPOT Gen3TM units with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products due to its enhanced tracking features.\nSimplex service revenue increased 10% in 2016 due to a 2% increase in average subscribers and a 9% increase in ARPU. In 2016, we reclassified activation fees from other service revenue to Simplex service revenue, which contributed $0.7 million, or almost 80%, of the increase year over year. Overall, the oil and gas industry downturn affecting some of our largest customers has significantly impacted our Simplex business.\nOther service revenue decreased $1.2 million, or 36%, in 2016. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to reclassification of activation fees from other revenue to Simplex and Duplex service revenue beginning in 2016, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease, almost 70% of the total decrease. Lower revenue generated from third party sources was the other major variance in other service revenue, contributing $0.4 million, or 30%, of the decrease. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we purchased service from other satellite providers that we sold to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. We have since transitioned the majority of these subscribers to our network. These decreases were offset by a $0.2 million increase in revenue generated from government contracts. Certain other smaller items recorded in other service revenue contributed to the remaining decrease.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2016 due to a sales promotion introduced in March 2015 that reduced the selling price of our Duplex handsets, thereby lowering the revenue generated from these equipment sales, and drove higher demand resulting in a higher volume of phones sold in 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales increased 5% in 2016 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 29% in 2016. The downturn in the oil and gas industry has negatively impacted our Simplex business due to the concentration or Simplex customers who operate in this industry.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses increased $3.4 million, or 2%, to $160.5 million in 2016 from $157.1 million in 2015, due primarily to increases in cost of services and marketing, general and administrative costs, offset by lower subscriber equipment sales.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $1.3 million, or 4%, to $31.9 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher maintenance costs to support our ground network, higher personnel costs due primarily to an increase in headcount, and higher research and development costs related to new products.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $1.9 million, or 16%, to $9.9 million in 2016 from $11.8 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales corresponds to the decrease in revenue from subscriber equipment sales from 2015 to 2016. However, the consolidated equipment margin remained consistent due to changes in the volume and mix of products sold during the respective periods and price variances across our worldwide markets and product portfolio.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 10%, to $41.0 million in 2016 from $37.4 million in 2015. The increase is due primarily to increases in stock compensation of $1.9 million, subscriber acquisition costs of $1.0 million and personnel costs of $1.3 million. Higher stock compensation costs were due to an increase in the volume of stock grants as well as the recognition of compensation costs resulting from success fees paid in shares of our common stock following the FCC's adoption of our report and order in December 2016 (see Part I: Item 1. Business for further discussion). Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulted from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion and aggressive rebate promotions. Higher personnel costs were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expense also related to the increase in the accrual for the settlement of litigation related to our Brazilian operations. We paid the total settlement of 4.5 million reais, or $1.4 million, by issuing approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock in October 2016. These increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to reserves recorded on certain commercial customer balances during 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nReduction in the Value of Long-Lived Assets\nReduction in the value of long-lived assets was $0.4 million in 2016. We recorded no reduction in the value of long-lived assets in 2015. As discussed in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of our intangible assets consist of costs associated with the efforts related to our petition to the FCC to use our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services. In November 2016, we revised our original proposal to the FCC to request terrestrial use of only our 11.5 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $0.4 million related the portion of our efforts specific to our original proposed rules.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense increased $0.2 million to $77.4 million in 2016 compared to $77.2 million in 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $207.1 million in construction in progress related to costs (including capitalized interest) associated with our contracts with Hughes and Ericsson to complete second-generation equipment upgrades to our ground infrastructure. We expect to begin depreciating these assets in the near future.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt during 2016. We recorded a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 due to holders of $6.5 million principal amount of our 2013 8.00% Notes converting their notes into 10.9 million shares of voting common stock. The fair value of the shares we issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nGain (Loss) on Equity Issuance\nGain (loss) on equity issuance was a gain of $2.4 million during 2016 compared to a loss of $6.7 million during 2015. This change was driven primarily by downside protection features included in certain of our contracts relating to payment of consideration with our common stock in lieu of cash.\nIn June 2015, Hughes exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain payment milestones in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares issued to Hughes at the 7% discount and the related liability for the potential issuance of additional shares, we initially recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter of 2015. In connection with this agreement, we also provided Hughes downside protection through June 30, 2017. This agreement generally required us to issue additional shares to Hughes if the market value of our common stock at the end of the downside protection period were less than the price at issuance. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date through the settlement date. During 2015, we recorded a total loss on equity issuance of $6.7 million, which included the initial non-cash loss of $1.2 million and subsequent non-cash losses of $5.5 million, representing changes in the estimated value of this option between initial issuance and December 31, 2015. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash gain of $2.8 million related to this downside protection option, representing changes in the value of this option between quarterly reporting periods in 2016.\nAs discussed above, in October 2016, we settled litigation related to our Brazilian subsidiary. In connection with this settlement, we agreed to provide downside protection for the difference between the total settlement amount of 4.5 million reais and the actual proceeds received by the third party upon sale of the shares. We accrued a total of 1.3 million reais, or $0.4 million, as of December 31, 2016 related to this downside protection, which may be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. We recorded this non-cash loss of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income and expense, net, increased $0.1 million to expense of $36.0 million for 2016 compared to expense of $35.9 million for 2015. Higher interest costs resulting primarily from a higher LIBOR-based interest rate on our Facility Agreement and a higher principal balance outstanding on our Thermo Loan Agreement were offset partially by make-whole interest payments made to converting note holders in the second quarter of 2015, which did not recur in 2016. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our outstanding debt balance.\nDerivative Gain (Loss)\nDerivative gain (loss) fluctuated by $223.4 million to a loss of $41.5 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $181.9 million in 2015. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. Although fluctuation in our stock price is the most significant cause for the change in value of these derivative instruments, other inputs can impact the value including volatility, discount rate, maturity date and changes in the principal amount of notes outstanding. Our stock price fluctuated significantly during 2016 and 2015, resulting in material non-cash derivative gains and losses in these periods. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the fair value computations of our derivatives.\nOther\nOther income (expense) fluctuated by $3.6 million to an expense of $0.4 million in 2016 from income of $3.2 million in 2015. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods given the significant financial statement items we have denominated in foreign currencies, including primarily the Brazilian real, euro and Canadian dollar. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since mid-2014 relative to certain other currencies, including the euro and Canadian dollar. Given the significant financial statement amounts we have denominated in these currencies, the foreign currency gains and losses decreased by $3.9 million to a loss of $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $3.7 million in 2015. During 2015, we recorded a foreign currency gain notwithstanding a $1.9 million loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary (see Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) fluctuated $7.9 million to a benefit of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to expense of $1.4 million in 2015. As a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with the tax position of one of our foreign subsidiaries, during the third quarter of 2016 we removed $6.3 million in unrecognized tax positions, inclusive of cumulative interest and penalties, from our non-current liabilities resulting in a corresponding tax benefit.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue:\nDuring 2015, total revenue increased $0.4 million to $90.5 million from $90.1 million in 2014. This increase was due primarily to a $4.3 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our subscriber base. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $3.9 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from lower selling prices of our Duplex phones and SPOT units ahead of the transition to second-generation products. Additionally, during 2015 movement of foreign exchange rates significantly burdened total revenue. Due to our global footprint, we generate a significant portion of our sales in foreign currencies. Total revenue would have been approximately $4.6 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>33,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>9,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Service Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equipment Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue.

We deactivated approximately 26,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 62,433 and ARPU would have been $36.03.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2015 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. For 2014 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 18,773 and 61,670, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present average subscribers or ARPU for other service revenue in the table above.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased $0.4 million in 2015. The Duplex subscriber base increased 14% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in service revenue generated from subscriber growth was offset partially by a decrease in ARPU (adjusted for the mass deactivations in 2014 as described above). Changes in the rate plans selected by our subscribers and the negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused this 2015 decrease in ARPU. In 2015 the movement of foreign exchange rates decreased Duplex service revenue by $2.3 million.\nSPOT service revenue increased 15% in 2015. SPOT ARPU increased 5% driven primarily by the significant number of SPOT Gen3TM sales over the past 12 months. We sell SPOT Gen3TM with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products. SPOT subscribers increased 11% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Expansion in international markets and a corresponding increase in activations are the principal reasons for growth in our SPOT subscriber base.\nSimplex service revenue increased 8% in 2015 due to a 14% increase in average Simplex subscribers during 2015, offset partially by a 5% decrease in ARPU due to the various competitive pricing plans we offer to our Simplex customers.\nOther revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 23%, in 2015. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to lower revenue generated from government contracts as well as a decrease in third party revenue. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned these subscribers to our network.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2015. Although there was a 14% increase in the Duplex subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, Duplex equipment sales revenue declined due to a reduction in the selling price of our phones beginning in early 2015 in advance of the introduction of second-generation products, which we expect in 2016. Reduced Duplex equipment pricing has contributed to the 48% increase in the number of phones sold during 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The rebates reduced equipment revenue, but contributed to the increase in SPOT service revenue by increasing our subscriber count. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015. This decrease is due to product mix as we sold a larger number of high margin units in 2014 and a larger number of low margin units in 2015.\nTotal equipment revenue would have been approximately $1.2 million higher during 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from 2014.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses decreased $28.9 million, or 16%, to $157.1 million in 2015 from $186.0 million in 2014, due primarily to the reduction in the value of inventory recognized in 2014, which did not recur during 2015, and lower depreciation expense.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $30.6 million in 2015 from $29.7 million in 2014. The Thales in-orbit support contract signed in the fourth quarter of 2014 contributed $0.7 million to this increase. Research and development costs related to new products were also higher in 2015. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. We also recognized a decrease in third party costs. As mentioned above in other service revenue, while we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers. We record these costs in other cost of services as third party costs. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned most of these subscribers to our network; therefore, the costs have decreased.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $3.0 million, or 20%, to $11.8 million in 2015 from $14.9 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales is due to changes in the carrying value, mix, and volume of products sold during the respective years. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the carrying value of Duplex inventory based on evaluating and estimating timing of new product launches.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales - Reduction in the Value of Inventory\nWe recognized no reduction in the value of inventory during 2015 compared to $21.7 million for 2014. The 2014 reduction consisted of the following:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $14.4 million. We recognized these charges after evaluating our Duplex inventory and estimating the timing of new product launches. Our assessment indicated that there was an excess of Duplex equipment included in inventory on hand based on our current sales run-rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $7.3 million following cancellation of our contract with Qualcomm related to finished goods and raw materials previously accounted for as advances for inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. We cancelled this contract in March 2013, and we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm in July 2014 whereby we paid $0.1 million to Qualcomm for all remaining finished goods and raw materials held at Qualcomm. Our future business plan contemplates using Hughes-based technology in future product development. As a result, much of the raw material held by Qualcomm is not likely to be used in the future production of additional inventory and their value was impaired.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketing, general and administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million, or 12%, to $37.4 million in 2015 from $33.5 million in 2014. Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulting from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion, and aggressive rebate promotions comprised 50% of the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses for 2015. We also incurred higher bad debt expense, which constituted 28% of the increase for 2015 due primarily to specific reserves we recorded for certain commercial customer balances. Higher personnel costs, which were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs, also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. Stock compensation expense also decreased $0.4 million primarily related to the vesting of a key employee performance grant during 2014, which did not recur in 2015.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense decreased $8.9 million, or 10%, to $77.2 million in 2015 compared to $86.1 million in 2014. This decrease relates primarily to our ending depreciation of our first-generation satellites launched during 2007, which reached the end of their estimated depreciable lives during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 compared to $39.8 million in 2014.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt during 2015 included:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Holders of $6.5 million principal amount of 2013 8.00% Notes converted their notes into our common stock, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million on the issuance of 10.9 million shares of voting common stock.

The fair value of the shares issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On April 15, 2014 we met the condition for automatic conversion of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009. During 2014, as a result of this automatic conversion and other conversions prior to April 15, 2014, holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 converted approximately $51.7 million principal amount of these notes into 47.1 million shares of common stock, resulting in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million. The derivative liability and principal amount written off exceeded the fair value of shares issued to the holders upon conversion, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on Equity Issuance\nLoss on equity issuance was $6.7 million during 2015 and $0.7 million during 2014.\nIn June 2015, Hughes exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain payment milestones in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares issued to Hughes at the 7% discount, we recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in loss on equity issuance in our consolidated statements of operations. In conjunction with this agreement, we also provided Hughes downside protection through March 31, 2016. This agreement generally would require us to issue additional shares to Hughes if the market value of our common stock at the end of the downside protection period is less than the price at issuance. We recorded an additional $5.5 million loss on equity issuance during 2015 based on an estimate of the value of this option calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date and through the settlement date.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, Hughes also exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain milestone payments in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. We recorded a loss of $0.7 million related to this discount in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income and expense, net, decreased $7.3 million to an expense of $35.9 million for 2015 compared to an expense of $43.2 million for 2014. This decrease resulted primarily from interest expense of approximately $4.0 million related to make-whole interest we paid to holders who converted 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 and 2013 8.00% Notes during 2014, compared to $0.6 million of make-whole interest paid to converting holders during 2015. A decrease in our outstanding debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest also contributed to the decrease in interest expense for the year. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the reduction in our outstanding debt balance, including conversions of the remaining 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 in April 2014 and a portion of the 2013 8.00% Notes at various dates throughout 2014 and 2015.\nDerivative Gain (Loss)\nDerivative gain (loss) fluctuated by $467.9 million to a gain of $181.9 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $286.0 million in 2014. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. Fluctuations in our stock price are the most significant cause for the change in value of these derivative instruments. Our stock price fluctuated significantly during 2015 and 2014, resulting in material non-cash derivative gains and losses in these periods. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the fair value computations of our derivatives.\nOther\nOther income decreased by $0.6 million to $3.2 million in 2015 from $3.8 million in 2014. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since mid-2014 relative to certain other currencies, including the euro and Canadian dollar. Given the significant financial statement amounts we have denominated in these currencies, the foreign currency gain decreased by $0.4 million to $3.7 million in 2015 compared to $4.1 million in 2014.\nWe recorded a foreign currency gain during 2015 notwithstanding a $1.9 million loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Effective July 1, 2015, we began using the SIMADI exchange rate published by the Central Bank of Venezuela to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiary's bolivar based transactions and net monetary assets in U.S. dollars. We determined, based upon our specific facts and circumstances, that the SIMADI rate is the most appropriate rate for financial reporting purposes, instead of the official exchange rate we previously used.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal liquidity requirements include paying our debt service obligations, funding our operating costs and paying amounts related to our capital projects. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand and cash flows from operations. We expect sources of liquidity to include funds from other debt or equity financings that have not yet been arranged. See below for further discussion. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of risks, some of which are beyond our control, affecting our ability to achieve our liquidity requirements.\nCash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nThe following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(328\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,287\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is comprised primarily of cash receipts from subscribers related to the purchase of equipment and satellite voice and data services. We use cash in operating activities primarily for personnel costs, inventory purchases and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 million during 2016 compared to $2.2 million during 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher cash receipts from the sale of inventory and favorable changes in certain operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 million during 2015 compared to $4.0 million during 2014. This decrease was due primarily to lower cash receipts for future services to be provided by us to our subscribers and lower cash receipts from the sale of inventory. These activities were offset partially by favorable fluctuations in certain operating assets and liabilities, including accounts payable and accrued expenses, other current assets and non-current liabilities.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $24.6 million during 2016 compared to $33.5 million during 2015. We used less cash for our second-generation ground projects during 2016 as we reached final acceptance under our core contracts with Hughes and Ericsson in December 2016. This decrease was offset partially by an increase in other property and equipment additions related to software and other back office expenditures to prepare for the rollout of new products.\nCash used in investing activities was $33.5 million during 2015 compared to $19.3 million during 2014. This increase was due primarily to an increase in spending related to our second-generation ground upgrades.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $18.5 million in 2016 compared to $33.3 million in 2015. The decrease was due to higher principal payments pursuant to our Facility Agreement, which were $32.8 million in 2016 compared to $6.5 million in 2015. The increase in our principal payments was offset partially by an increase in cash received from the sale of shares of our common stock to Terrapin, which was $48.0 million in 2016 compared to $39.0 million in 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $33.3 million in 2015 compared to $5.3 million in 2014. This increase was due primarily to cash received from the sale of common stock to Terrapin, offset partially by higher principal payments on the Facility Agreement and a reduction in cash received for warrants exercised and other share issuances.\nCash Position and Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $10.2 million. We also had $38.0 million in restricted cash, consisting of the balance in our debt service reserve account under the Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement requires us to maintain $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account and restricts the use of these funds to making principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a $75.0 million common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin (the \"August 2015 Terrapin Agreement\"), under which we could draw over a 24-month period. As of December 31, 2016, $12.0 million remained available under this agreement. In January 2017, we drew this remaining $12.0 million to achieve compliance with certain financial covenants in our Facility Agreement for the measurement period ended December 31, 2016. See below for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million and had $37.9 million in restricted cash.\nThe carrying amount of our current and long-term debt outstanding was $75.8 million and $500.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016, compared to $32.8 million and $548.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The current portion of our long-term debt outstanding at these dates represents principal payments under our Facility Agreement scheduled to occur within 12 months of the measurement date. The $4.8 million net decrease in our total debt balance during 2016 was due primarily to principal payments we made under our Facility Agreement, offset by an increase in the carrying value of the Thermo Loan Agreement due to interest accruing on that debt and accretion of the debt discounts related to our convertible notes.\nFacility Agreement\nWe entered into the Facility Agreement in 2009, which was amended and restated in July 2013 and August 2015. The Facility Agreement is scheduled to mature in December 2022. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Facility Agreement contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial and non-financial covenants. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain a sufficient Equity Cure Contribution (as described below) or a waiver, or are unable to make payments to satisfy our debt obligations under the Facility Agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver, we would be in default under the Facility Agreement, and the lenders could accelerate payment of the indebtedness. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-acceleration provisions. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Facility Agreement.\nThe compliance calculations of the financial covenants of the Facility Agreement permit us to include certain cash funds we receive from the issuance of our common stock and/or subordinated indebtedness before or immediately after the calculation date. We refer to these funds as \"Equity Cure Contributions,\" and we may include them in calculating compliance with financial covenants, subject to the conditions set forth in the Facility Agreement. Through December 31, 2016, we drew $63.0 million under our agreement with Terrapin, as described below. In January 2017, we drew the remaining $12.0 million. We used these funds as Equity Cure Contributions under the Facility Agreement with respect to calculating compliance with financial covenants for the measurement periods ended December 31, 2015, June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. We anticipate that we will need additional Equity Cure Contributions to maintain compliance with financial covenants under the Facility Agreement for the measurement periods ended June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The source of funds for these Equity Cure Contributions has not yet been fully arranged.\nThe Facility Agreement also requires that we maintain a total of $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account that is pledged to secure all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement. We may use these funds only to make principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the balance in the debt service reserve account, which we established\nwith the proceeds of the loan agreement with Thermo discussed below, was $38.0 million and classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur indebtedness under the Facility Agreement bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% through June 2017, increasing by an additional 0.5% each year thereafter to a maximum rate of LIBOR plus 5.75%. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed by Bpifrance (formerly COFACE), the French export credit agency. Our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries (other than their FCC licenses), including patents and trademarks, 100% of the equity of our domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nIn August 2013, pursuant to an amendment and restatement of the Facility Agreement, we paid the lenders a restructuring fee plus an additional underwriting fee to COFACE in the aggregate amount of approximately $13.9 million, representing 40% of the total restructuring and underwriting fee; the balance of $20.8 million is due no later than December 31, 2017. We include this remaining amount in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nSee discussion in Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Facility Agreement.\nThermo Loan Agreement\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement of the Facility Agreement in 2013, we amended and restated our loan agreement with Thermo (as amended and restated, the Thermo Loan Agreement\u201d). Our obligations to Thermo under the Thermo Loan Agreement are subordinated to all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nAmounts outstanding under the Thermo Loan Agreement accrue interest at 12% per annum, which we capitalize and add to the outstanding principal in lieu of cash payments. We will make payments to Thermo only when permitted by the Facility Agreement. Principal and interest under the Thermo Loan Agreement become due and payable six months after the obligations under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full, or earlier if there is a change in control or any acceleration of the maturity of the loans under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, $50.5 million of interest had accrued since 2009 with respect to the Thermo Loan Agreement; we include this amount in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement of the Facility Agreement in 2015, Thermo and certain of its affiliates executed and delivered to the agent under the Facility Agreement the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter and entered into an Equity Commitment Agreement (the Equity Agreement\u201d) and the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter and the Equity Agreement, Thermo agreed to make available to us cash equity financing in the aggregate amount of up to $30.0 million. The balance of this commitment declined concurrently with draws under the Terrapin Agreement during 2015 and 2016. As a result, at December 31, 2016 Thermo and its affiliates had no remaining cash equity commitment under the Equity Agreement.\nSee Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter, the Equity Agreement, and the Thermo Loan Agreement.\n8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013\nOur 2013 8.00% Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.73 (as adjusted) per share of common stock, or 1,370 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2013 8.00% Notes. The 2013 8.00% Notes will mature on April 1, 2028, subject to various call and put features, as discussed further below. Interest on the 2013 8.00% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. We pay interest in cash at a rate of 5.75% per annum and by issuing additional 2013 8.00% Notes at a rate of 2.25% per annum.\nA holder of 2013 8.00% Notes has the right, at the holder's option, to require us to purchase some or all of the 2013 8.00% Notes on each of April 1, 2018 and April 1, 2023 at a price equal to the principal amount of the 2013 8.00% Notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe indenture governing the 2013 8.00% Notes provides for customary events of default. If there is an event of default, the Trustee may, at the direction of the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the 2013 8.00% Notes, accelerate the maturity of the 2013 8.00% Notes. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with respect to the indenture governing the 2013 8.00% Notes.\nSee Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of our 2013 8.00% Notes.\nTerrapin Opportunity, L.P. Common Stock Purchase Agreement\nOn December 28, 2012 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin pursuant to which we were entitled to require Terrapin to purchase up to $30.0 million of shares of our voting common stock over the 24-month term beginning on August 2, 2013. Through the term of this agreement, Terrapin purchased a total of 17.2 million shares of voting common stock at a total purchase price of $30.0 million. No funds remain available under this agreement.\nIn conjunction with the amendment to the Facility Agreement in August 2015 (as discussed above), we entered into the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement pursuant to which we were entitled to require Terrapin to purchase up to $75.0 million of shares of our voting common stock over the 24-month term following the date of the agreement. Through December 31, 2016, we drew $63.0 million by issuing 58.4 million shares of voting common stock. At December 31, 2016, $12.0 million remained available under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement. We drew these funds in January 2017.\nSee Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Terrapin agreement.\nWarrants Outstanding\nWarrants are outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock as shown in the table below:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Strike Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent Equity Agreement (1)\n</td> <td>24,571,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,191,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.0% Warrants (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>24,571,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,191,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Pursuant to the terms of the Contingent Equity Agreement with Thermo (See Note 9: Related Party Transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the Contingent Equity Agreement), we issued to Thermo warrants to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the annual availability fee and subsequent reset provisions in the Contingent Equity Agreement. These warrants are exercisable for five years from issuance.

See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the 5.0% Warrants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nWe have entered into various contractual agreements, primarily with Hughes and Ericsson, related to the procurement and deployment of our second-generation gateways and other ground facilities.\nOur agreements with Hughes are related to design, supply and implementation of RAN network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our gateway ground stations. Hughes also provided the satellite interface chips to be used in various second-generation devices. In March 2015, we entered into an agreement with Hughes for the design, development, build, testing and delivery of four custom test equipment units for a total of $1.9 million. Hughes delivered this test equipment during the fourth quarter of 2015. In April 2015, we elected an option under the terms of the original Hughes contract and extended the scope of work for delivery of two additional RANs for a total of $4.0 million. These RANs were delivered in February 2016. In July 2015, we formally amended the contract with Hughes to include the revised scope of work set forth in the March 2015 and April 2015 letter agreements. We reflect the additional $1.9 million for delivery of four custom test equipment units and the $4.0 million for delivery of two additional RANs agreed to in March and April 2015, respectively, in the contract through this amendment.\nIn December 2016, we formally accepted all contract deliverables under our agreement with Hughes. The remaining amount owed under the contract is $0.8 million; we recorded this amount in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nOur agreements with Ericsson relate to development, implementation and maintenance of a ground interface, or core network system, installed at a number of our gateways. In July 2014, we signed an amended and restated contract to specify the remaining contract value and a new milestone schedule to reflect a revised program time line. In August 2015, we executed a second amendment to the 2014 contract that incorporated revised payment and pricing schedules. In December 2016, we formally accepted all contract deliverables for the IMS solution under our agreement with Ericsson, with the exception of a punch list of items. The remaining amounts owed under the contract are approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded $1.2 million related to these contracts in accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn addition to the contractual agreements mentioned above, we have a contract with Thales for the construction of the second-generation low-earth orbit satellites and related services. We successfully completed the launches of our second-generation satellites. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with Thales regarding certain deliverables under the contract. See Note 7: Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Network purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract termination charge (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt restructuring fees (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>925,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>These amounts include cash and payment in kind (\"PIK\") interest.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements as well as the consideration of recently issued accounting standards and the estimated impact these standards will have on our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition; property and equipment; income taxes; and derivative instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nWe define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. We believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, there are other items within our Consolidated Financial Statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary types of revenue include (i) service revenue from two-way voice communication and data transmissions and one-way data transmissions between a mobile or fixed device and (ii) subscriber equipment revenue from the sale of Duplex two-way transmission products, SPOT consumer retail products and Simplex one-way transmission products. Additionally, we generate revenue by providing engineering and support services to certain customers. We recognize revenue at the time services are rendered, assuming all revenue recognition criteria is met under applicable accounting guidance. We record amounts received in advance as deferred revenue. We provide Duplex, SPOT and Simplex services directly to customers and indirectly through resellers and IGOs. We expense or charge credits granted to customers against revenue or accounts receivable upon issuance. We expense subscriber acquisition costs, including dealer and internal sales commissions and certain other costs at the time of the related sale, except as it relates to certain multiple-element arrangement contracts.\nDuplex Service Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for monthly access fees in the period we render services. Access fees represent the minimum monthly charge for each line of service based on its associated rate plan. We also recognize revenue for airtime minutes in excess of the monthly access fees in the period such minutes are used. Under certain annual plans where customers prepay for a predetermined amount of minutes, we defer revenue until the minutes are used or the prepaid time period expires. Unused minutes accumulate until they expire, at which point we recognize revenue for any remaining unused minutes. For annual access fees charged for certain annual plans, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the plan.\nSPOT and Simplex Service Revenue\nWe sell SPOT and Simplex services as annual or multi-year plans and recognize revenue ratably over the service term or as service is used, beginning when the service is activated by the customer.\nIGO Service Revenue\nWe earn a portion of our revenues through the sale of airtime minutes or data packages on a wholesale basis to IGOs. We recognize revenue from services provided to IGOs based upon airtime minutes or data packages used by their customers and in accordance with contractual fee arrangements.\nOther Service Revenue\nWe also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies related to our system. We generally recognize the revenues associated with these services when the services are rendered, and we recognize the expenses when incurred.\nEquipment Revenue\nSubscriber equipment revenue represents the sale of fixed and mobile user terminals, SPOT and Simplex products, and accessories to these products. We recognize revenue upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collection is probable.\nRevenue Contracts with Multiple Elements\nAt times, we will sell subscriber equipment through multiple-element arrangement contracts with services. When we sell subscriber equipment and services in bundled arrangements and determine that we have separate units of accounting, we will allocate the bundled contract price among the various contract deliverables based on each deliverable's relative fair value. We will determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value by assessing sales prices of subscriber equipment and services when they are sold to customers on a stand-alone basis. We will defer initial direct costs incurred related to these contracts to the extent they exceed the profit margin recognized at the time of sale.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe capitalize costs associated with the design, manufacture, test and launch of our low earth orbit satellites. We track capitalized costs associated with our satellites by fixed asset category and allocate them to each asset as it comes into service. For assets that are sold or retired, including satellites that are de-orbited and no longer providing services, we remove the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation. We recognize a loss from an in-orbit failure of a satellite as an expense in the period it is determined that the satellite is not recoverable.\nWe depreciate satellites over their estimated useful lives, beginning on the date each satellite is placed into service. We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated depreciable lives assigned to our property and equipment and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances.\nWe capitalize costs associated with the design, manufacture and test of our ground stations and other capital assets. We track capitalized costs associated with our ground stations and other capital assets by fixed asset category and allocate them to each asset as it comes into service.\nWe review the carrying value of our assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value may not be recoverable. We look to current and future undiscounted cash flows, excluding financing costs, as\nprimary indicators of recoverability. If we determine that impairment exists, we calculate any related impairment loss based on fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations. Changes in state, federal and foreign tax laws, as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities, could affect these estimates. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted.\nGAAP requires us to assess whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. If we cannot determine that deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recoverable, GAAP requires us to provide a valuation allowance against those assets. This assessment takes into account factors including: (a) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses; (b) sources of estimated future taxable income; and (c) tax planning strategies. We must weigh heavily a pattern of recent financial reporting losses as a source of negative evidence when determining our ability to realize deferred tax assets. Projections of estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profitable operations and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, GAAP requires that we consider projections inherently subjective and generally insufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes cumulative losses in recent years. If necessary and available, we would implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence supporting the realization of deferred tax assets.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. We record recognized gains or losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe estimate the fair values of our derivative financial instruments using various techniques that are considered to be consistent with the objective of measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that embody it and the expected means of settlement. There are various features embedded in our debt instruments that require bifurcation from the debt host. For the conversion options and the contingent put features in the Thermo Loan Agreement and the 2013 8.00% Notes, we use a blend of a Monte Carlo simulation model and market prices to determine fair value.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and other information included elsewhere in this Report, including risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report.\nPerformance Indicators\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows. These key performance indicators include:\n \u2022 total revenue, which is an indicator of our overall business growth; \n \u2022 subscriber growth and churn rate, which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers; \n \u2022 average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long-term, high-value customers. We calculate ARPU separately for each type of our Duplex, Simplex, SPOT and IGO revenue; \n \u2022 operating income and adjusted EBITDA, both of which are indicators of our financial performance; and \n \u2022 capital expenditures, which are an indicator of future revenue growth potential and cash requirements. \nComparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue:\nDuring 2016, total revenue increased $6.4 million to $96.9 million from $90.5 million in 2015. This increase was due primarily to a $9.0 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our average subscriber base and increases in ARPU. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $2.6 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from a lower volume of Simplex and Duplex units sold during 2016.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\n\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue. \nDuring 2016, gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 20,169 and 75,163, respectively. During 2015, gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated primarily from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present ARPU for other service revenue in the table above. Effective April 1, 2016, we began reclassifying activations fees with the service revenue to which they relate.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased 16% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU compared to 2015. The average Duplex subscriber base increased 5% and ARPU increased 11% in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher ARPU was due primarily to increased revenue from annual, usage-based plans and price increases. In early 2015, we reduced the selling price of our phones and launched various promotions, resulting in an increase in the popularity of our annual, usage-based plans. These plans resulted in higher service revenue recognized during 2016 related to the 2015 promotions where unused minutes expire on the anniversary date of the customer's contract. We also increased prices for certain of our legacy rate plans during 2016 to align our rate plans with our service levels and prospective rate plans for future products.\nSPOT service revenue increased 14% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU. The average number of SPOT subscribers increased 7% and ARPU increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015. The ARPU increase was driven primarily by rate plan increases and the nearly 43,000 SPOT Gen3TM activations during 2016. We sell SPOT Gen3TM units with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products due to its enhanced tracking features.\nSimplex service revenue increased 10% in 2016 due to a 2% increase in average subscribers and a 9% increase in ARPU. In 2016, we reclassified activation fees from other service revenue to Simplex service revenue, which contributed $0.7 million, or almost 80%, of the increase year over year. Overall, the oil and gas industry downturn affecting some of our largest customers has significantly impacted our Simplex business.\nOther service revenue decreased $1.2 million, or 36%, in 2016. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to reclassification of activation fees from other revenue to Simplex and Duplex service revenue beginning in 2016, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease, almost 70% of the total decrease. Lower revenue generated from third party sources was the other major variance in other service revenue, contributing $0.4 million, or 30%, of the decrease. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we purchased service from other satellite providers that we sold to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. We have since transitioned the majority of these subscribers to our network. These decreases were offset by a $0.2 million increase in revenue generated from government contracts. Certain other smaller items recorded in other service revenue contributed to the remaining decrease.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2016 due to a sales promotion introduced in March 2015 that reduced the selling price of our Duplex handsets, thereby lowering the revenue generated from these equipment sales, and drove higher demand resulting in a higher volume of phones sold in 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales increased 5% in 2016 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 29% in 2016. The downturn in the oil and gas industry has negatively impacted our Simplex business due to the concentration or Simplex customers who operate in this industry.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses increased $3.4 million, or 2%, to $160.5 million in 2016 from $157.1 million in 2015, due primarily to increases in cost of services and marketing, general and administrative costs, offset by lower subscriber equipment sales.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $1.3 million, or 4%, to $31.9 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher maintenance costs to support our ground network, higher personnel costs due primarily to an increase in headcount, and higher research and development costs related to new products.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $1.9 million, or 16%, to $9.9 million in 2016 from $11.8 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales corresponds to the decrease in revenue from subscriber equipment sales from 2015 to 2016. However, the consolidated equipment margin remained consistent due to changes in the volume and mix of products sold during the respective periods and price variances across our worldwide markets and product portfolio.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 10%, to $41.0 million in 2016 from $37.4 million in 2015. The increase is due primarily to increases in stock compensation of $1.9 million, subscriber acquisition costs of $1.0 million and personnel costs of $1.3 million. Higher stock compensation costs were due to an increase in the volume of stock grants as well as the recognition of compensation costs resulting from success fees paid in shares of our common stock following the FCC's adoption of our report and order in December 2016 (see Part I: Item 1. Business for further discussion). Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulted from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion and aggressive rebate promotions. Higher personnel costs were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expense also related to the increase in the accrual for the settlement of litigation related to our Brazilian operations. We paid the total settlement of 4.5 million reais, or $1.4 million, by issuing approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock in October 2016. These increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to reserves recorded on certain commercial customer balances during 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nReduction in the Value of Long-Lived Assets\nReduction in the value of long-lived assets was $0.4 million in 2016. We recorded no reduction in the value of long-lived assets in 2015. As discussed in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of our intangible assets consist of costs associated with the efforts related to our petition to the FCC to use our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services. In November 2016, we revised our original proposal to the FCC to request terrestrial use of only our 11.5 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $0.4 million related the portion of our efforts specific to our original proposed rules.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense increased $0.2 million to $77.4 million in 2016 compared to $77.2 million in 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $207.1 million in construction in progress related to costs (including capitalized interest) associated with our contracts with Hughes and Ericsson to complete second-generation equipment upgrades to our ground infrastructure. We expect to begin depreciating these assets in the near future.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt during 2016. We recorded a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 due to holders of $6.5 million principal amount of our 2013 8.00% Notes converting their notes into 10.9 million shares of voting common stock. The fair value of the shares we issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nGain (Loss) on Equity Issuance\nGain (loss) on equity issuance was a gain of $2.4 million during 2016 compared to a loss of $6.7 million during 2015. This change was driven primarily by downside protection features included in certain of our contracts relating to payment of consideration with our common stock in lieu of cash.\nIn June 2015, Hughes exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain payment milestones in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares issued to Hughes at the 7% discount and the related liability for the potential issuance of additional shares, we initially recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter of 2015. In connection with this agreement, we also provided Hughes downside protection through June 30, 2017. This agreement generally required us to issue additional shares to Hughes if the market value of our common stock at the end of the downside protection period were less than the price at issuance. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date through the settlement date. During 2015, we recorded a total loss on equity issuance of $6.7 million, which included the initial non-cash loss of $1.2 million and subsequent non-cash losses of $5.5 million, representing changes in the estimated value of this option between initial issuance and December 31, 2015. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash gain of $2.8 million related to this downside protection option, representing changes in the value of this option between quarterly reporting periods in 2016.\nAs discussed above, in October 2016, we settled litigation related to our Brazilian subsidiary. In connection with this settlement, we agreed to provide downside protection for the difference between the total settlement amount of 4.5 million reais and the actual proceeds received by the third party upon sale of the shares. We accrued a total of 1.3 million reais, or $0.4 million, as of December 31, 2016 related to this downside protection, which may be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. We recorded this non-cash loss of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income and expense, net, increased $0.1 million to expense of $36.0 million for 2016 compared to expense of $35.9 million for 2015. Higher interest costs resulting primarily from a higher LIBOR-based interest rate on our Facility Agreement and a higher principal balance outstanding on our Thermo Loan Agreement were offset partially by make-whole interest payments made to converting note holders in the second quarter of 2015, which did not recur in 2016. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our outstanding debt balance.\nDerivative Gain (Loss)\nDerivative gain (loss) fluctuated by $223.4 million to a loss of $41.5 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $181.9 million in 2015. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. Although fluctuation in our stock price is the most significant cause for the change in value of these derivative instruments, other inputs can impact the value including volatility, discount rate, maturity date and changes in the principal amount of notes outstanding. Our stock price fluctuated significantly during 2016 and 2015, resulting in material non-cash derivative gains and losses in these periods. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the fair value computations of our derivatives.\nOther\nOther income (expense) fluctuated by $3.6 million to an expense of $0.4 million in 2016 from income of $3.2 million in 2015. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods given the significant financial statement items we have denominated in foreign currencies, including primarily the Brazilian real, euro and Canadian dollar. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since mid-2014 relative to certain other currencies, including the euro and Canadian dollar. Given the significant financial statement amounts we have denominated in these currencies, the foreign currency gains and losses decreased by $3.9 million to a loss of $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $3.7 million in 2015. During 2015, we recorded a foreign currency gain notwithstanding a $1.9 million loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary (see Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) fluctuated $7.9 million to a benefit of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to expense of $1.4 million in 2015. As a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with the tax position of one of our foreign subsidiaries, during the third quarter of 2016 we removed $6.3 million in unrecognized tax positions, inclusive of cumulative interest and penalties, from our non-current liabilities resulting in a corresponding tax benefit.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue:\nDuring 2015, total revenue increased $0.4 million to $90.5 million from $90.1 million in 2014. This increase was due primarily to a $4.3 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our subscriber base. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $3.9 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from lower selling prices of our Duplex phones and SPOT units ahead of the transition to second-generation products. Additionally, during 2015 movement of foreign exchange rates significantly burdened total revenue. Due to our global footprint, we generate a significant portion of our sales in foreign currencies. Total revenue would have been approximately $4.6 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\n\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue. \n (1) In 2014 we initiated a process to deactivate certain subscribers in our Duplex subscriber base who were either suspended or non-paying. We deactivated approximately 26,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 62,433 and ARPU would have been $36.03. \nFor 2015 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. For 2014 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 18,773 and 61,670, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present average subscribers or ARPU for other service revenue in the table above.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased $0.4 million in 2015. The Duplex subscriber base increased 14% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in service revenue generated from subscriber growth was offset partially by a decrease in ARPU (adjusted for the mass deactivations in 2014 as described above). Changes in the rate plans selected by our subscribers and the negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused this 2015 decrease in ARPU. In 2015 the movement of foreign exchange rates decreased Duplex service revenue by $2.3 million.\nSPOT service revenue increased 15% in 2015. SPOT ARPU increased 5% driven primarily by the significant number of SPOT Gen3TM sales over the past 12 months. We sell SPOT Gen3TM with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products. SPOT subscribers increased 11% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Expansion in international markets and a corresponding increase in activations are the principal reasons for growth in our SPOT subscriber base.\nSimplex service revenue increased 8% in 2015 due to a 14% increase in average Simplex subscribers during 2015, offset partially by a 5% decrease in ARPU due to the various competitive pricing plans we offer to our Simplex customers.\nOther revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 23%, in 2015. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to lower revenue generated from government contracts as well as a decrease in third party revenue. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned these subscribers to our network.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2015. Although there was a 14% increase in the Duplex subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, Duplex equipment sales revenue declined due to a reduction in the selling price of our phones beginning in early 2015 in advance of the introduction of second-generation products, which we expect in 2016. Reduced Duplex equipment pricing has contributed to the 48% increase in the number of phones sold during 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The rebates reduced equipment revenue, but contributed to the increase in SPOT service revenue by increasing our subscriber count. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015. This decrease is due to product mix as we sold a larger number of high margin units in 2014 and a larger number of low margin units in 2015.\nTotal equipment revenue would have been approximately $1.2 million higher during 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from 2014.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses decreased $28.9 million, or 16%, to $157.1 million in 2015 from $186.0 million in 2014, due primarily to the reduction in the value of inventory recognized in 2014, which did not recur during 2015, and lower depreciation expense.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $30.6 million in 2015 from $29.7 million in 2014. The Thales in-orbit support contract signed in the fourth quarter of 2014 contributed $0.7 million to this increase. Research and development costs related to new products were also higher in 2015. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. We also recognized a decrease in third party costs. As mentioned above in other service revenue, while we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers. We record these costs in other cost of services as third party costs. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned most of these subscribers to our network; therefore, the costs have decreased.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $3.0 million, or 20%, to $11.8 million in 2015 from $14.9 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales is due to changes in the carrying value, mix, and volume of products sold during the respective years. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the carrying value of Duplex inventory based on evaluating and estimating timing of new product launches.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales - Reduction in the Value of Inventory\nWe recognized no reduction in the value of inventory during 2015 compared to $21.7 million for 2014. The 2014 reduction consisted of the following:\n \u2022 During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $14.4 million. We recognized these charges after evaluating our Duplex inventory and estimating the timing of new product launches. Our assessment indicated that there was an excess of Duplex equipment included in inventory on hand based on our current sales run-rate. \n \u2022 During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $7.3 million following cancellation of our contract with Qualcomm related to finished goods and raw materials previously accounted for as advances for inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. We cancelled this contract in March 2013, and we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm in July 2014 whereby we paid $0.1 million to Qualcomm for all remaining finished goods and raw materials held at Qualcomm. Our future business plan contemplates using Hughes-based technology in future product development. As a result, much of the raw material held by Qualcomm is not likely to be used in the future production of additional inventory and their value was impaired. \nMarketing, general and administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million, or 12%, to $37.4 million in 2015 from $33.5 million in 2014. Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulting from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion, and aggressive rebate promotions comprised 50% of the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses for 2015. We also incurred higher bad debt expense, which constituted 28% of the increase for 2015 due primarily to specific reserves we recorded for certain commercial customer balances. Higher personnel costs, which were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs, also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. Stock compensation expense also decreased $0.4 million primarily related to the vesting of a key employee performance grant during 2014, which did not recur in 2015.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense decreased $8.9 million, or 10%, to $77.2 million in 2015 compared to $86.1 million in 2014. This decrease relates primarily to our ending depreciation of our first-generation satellites launched during 2007, which reached the end of their estimated depreciable lives during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 compared to $39.8 million in 2014.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt during 2015 included:\n \u2022 Holders of $6.5 million principal amount of 2013 8.00% Notes converted their notes", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and other information included elsewhere in this Report, including risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report.\nPerformance Indicators\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows. These key performance indicators include:\n \u2022 total revenue, which is an indicator of our overall business growth; \n \u2022 subscriber growth and churn rate, which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers; \n \u2022 average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long-term, high-value customers. We calculate ARPU separately for each type of our Duplex, Simplex, SPOT and IGO revenue; \n \u2022 operating income and adjusted EBITDA, both of which are indicators of our financial performance; and \n \u2022 capital expenditures, which are an indicator of future revenue growth potential and cash requirements. \nComparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue:\nDuring 2016, total revenue increased $6.4 million to $96.9 million from $90.5 million in 2015. This increase was due primarily to a $9.0 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our average subscriber base and increases in ARPU. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $2.6 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from a lower volume of Simplex and Duplex units sold during 2016.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>38,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>10,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Service Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>5,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>3,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equipment Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue.

During 2015, gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated primarily from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present ARPU for other service revenue in the table above. Effective April 1, 2016, we began reclassifying activations fees with the service revenue to which they relate.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased 16% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU compared to 2015. The average Duplex subscriber base increased 5% and ARPU increased 11% in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher ARPU was due primarily to increased revenue from annual, usage-based plans and price increases. In early 2015, we reduced the selling price of our phones and launched various promotions, resulting in an increase in the popularity of our annual, usage-based plans. These plans resulted in higher service revenue recognized during 2016 related to the 2015 promotions where unused minutes expire on the anniversary date of the customer's contract. We also increased prices for certain of our legacy rate plans during 2016 to align our rate plans with our service levels and prospective rate plans for future products.\nSPOT service revenue increased 14% in 2016 due to increases in both the average subscriber base and ARPU. The average number of SPOT subscribers increased 7% and ARPU increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015. The ARPU increase was driven primarily by rate plan increases and the nearly 43,000 SPOT Gen3TM activations during 2016. We sell SPOT Gen3TM units with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products due to its enhanced tracking features.\nSimplex service revenue increased 10% in 2016 due to a 2% increase in average subscribers and a 9% increase in ARPU. In 2016, we reclassified activation fees from other service revenue to Simplex service revenue, which contributed $0.7 million, or almost 80%, of the increase year over year. Overall, the oil and gas industry downturn affecting some of our largest customers has significantly impacted our Simplex business.\nOther service revenue decreased $1.2 million, or 36%, in 2016. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to reclassification of activation fees from other revenue to Simplex and Duplex service revenue beginning in 2016, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease, almost 70% of the total decrease. Lower revenue generated from third party sources was the other major variance in other service revenue, contributing $0.4 million, or 30%, of the decrease. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we purchased service from other satellite providers that we sold to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. We have since transitioned the majority of these subscribers to our network. These decreases were offset by a $0.2 million increase in revenue generated from government contracts. Certain other smaller items recorded in other service revenue contributed to the remaining decrease.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2016 due to a sales promotion introduced in March 2015 that reduced the selling price of our Duplex handsets, thereby lowering the revenue generated from these equipment sales, and drove higher demand resulting in a higher volume of phones sold in 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales increased 5% in 2016 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 29% in 2016. The downturn in the oil and gas industry has negatively impacted our Simplex business due to the concentration or Simplex customers who operate in this industry.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses increased $3.4 million, or 2%, to $160.5 million in 2016 from $157.1 million in 2015, due primarily to increases in cost of services and marketing, general and administrative costs, offset by lower subscriber equipment sales.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $1.3 million, or 4%, to $31.9 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher maintenance costs to support our ground network, higher personnel costs due primarily to an increase in headcount, and higher research and development costs related to new products.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $1.9 million, or 16%, to $9.9 million in 2016 from $11.8 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales corresponds to the decrease in revenue from subscriber equipment sales from 2015 to 2016. However, the consolidated equipment margin remained consistent due to changes in the volume and mix of products sold during the respective periods and price variances across our worldwide markets and product portfolio.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 10%, to $41.0 million in 2016 from $37.4 million in 2015. The increase is due primarily to increases in stock compensation of $1.9 million, subscriber acquisition costs of $1.0 million and personnel costs of $1.3 million. Higher stock compensation costs were due to an increase in the volume of stock grants as well as the recognition of compensation costs resulting from success fees paid in shares of our common stock following the FCC's adoption of our report and order in December 2016 (see Part I: Item 1. Business for further discussion). Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulted from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion and aggressive rebate promotions. Higher personnel costs were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expense also related to the increase in the accrual for the settlement of litigation related to our Brazilian operations. We paid the total settlement of 4.5 million reais, or $1.4 million, by issuing approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock in October 2016. These increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to reserves recorded on certain commercial customer balances during 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nReduction in the Value of Long-Lived Assets\nReduction in the value of long-lived assets was $0.4 million in 2016. We recorded no reduction in the value of long-lived assets in 2015. As discussed in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of our intangible assets consist of costs associated with the efforts related to our petition to the FCC to use our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services. In November 2016, we revised our original proposal to the FCC to request terrestrial use of only our 11.5 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $0.4 million related the portion of our efforts specific to our original proposed rules.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense increased $0.2 million to $77.4 million in 2016 compared to $77.2 million in 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $207.1 million in construction in progress related to costs (including capitalized interest) associated with our contracts with Hughes and Ericsson to complete second-generation equipment upgrades to our ground infrastructure. We expect to begin depreciating these assets in the near future.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt during 2016. We recorded a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 due to holders of $6.5 million principal amount of our 2013 8.00% Notes converting their notes into 10.9 million shares of voting common stock. The fair value of the shares we issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nGain (Loss) on Equity Issuance\nGain (loss) on equity issuance was a gain of $2.4 million during 2016 compared to a loss of $6.7 million during 2015. This change was driven primarily by downside protection features included in certain of our contracts relating to payment of consideration with our common stock in lieu of cash.\nIn June 2015, Hughes exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain payment milestones in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares issued to Hughes at the 7% discount and the related liability for the potential issuance of additional shares, we initially recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter of 2015. In connection with this agreement, we also provided Hughes downside protection through June 30, 2017. This agreement generally required us to issue additional shares to Hughes if the market value of our common stock at the end of the downside protection period were less than the price at issuance. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date through the settlement date. During 2015, we recorded a total loss on equity issuance of $6.7 million, which included the initial non-cash loss of $1.2 million and subsequent non-cash losses of $5.5 million, representing changes in the estimated value of this option between initial issuance and December 31, 2015. During 2016, we recorded a non-cash gain of $2.8 million related to this downside protection option, representing changes in the value of this option between quarterly reporting periods in 2016.\nAs discussed above, in October 2016, we settled litigation related to our Brazilian subsidiary. In connection with this settlement, we agreed to provide downside protection for the difference between the total settlement amount of 4.5 million reais and the actual proceeds received by the third party upon sale of the shares. We accrued a total of 1.3 million reais, or $0.4 million, as of December 31, 2016 related to this downside protection, which may be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. We recorded this non-cash loss of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income and expense, net, increased $0.1 million to expense of $36.0 million for 2016 compared to expense of $35.9 million for 2015. Higher interest costs resulting primarily from a higher LIBOR-based interest rate on our Facility Agreement and a higher principal balance outstanding on our Thermo Loan Agreement were offset partially by make-whole interest payments made to converting note holders in the second quarter of 2015, which did not recur in 2016. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our outstanding debt balance.\nDerivative Gain (Loss)\nDerivative gain (loss) fluctuated by $223.4 million to a loss of $41.5 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $181.9 million in 2015. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. Although fluctuation in our stock price is the most significant cause for the change in value of these derivative instruments, other inputs can impact the value including volatility, discount rate, maturity date and changes in the principal amount of notes outstanding. Our stock price fluctuated significantly during 2016 and 2015, resulting in material non-cash derivative gains and losses in these periods. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the fair value computations of our derivatives.\nOther\nOther income (expense) fluctuated by $3.6 million to an expense of $0.4 million in 2016 from income of $3.2 million in 2015. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods given the significant financial statement items we have denominated in foreign currencies, including primarily the Brazilian real, euro and Canadian dollar. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since mid-2014 relative to certain other currencies, including the euro and Canadian dollar. Given the significant financial statement amounts we have denominated in these currencies, the foreign currency gains and losses decreased by $3.9 million to a loss of $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $3.7 million in 2015. During 2015, we recorded a foreign currency gain notwithstanding a $1.9 million loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary (see Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) fluctuated $7.9 million to a benefit of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to expense of $1.4 million in 2015. As a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with the tax position of one of our foreign subsidiaries, during the third quarter of 2016 we removed $6.3 million in unrecognized tax positions, inclusive of cumulative interest and penalties, from our non-current liabilities resulting in a corresponding tax benefit.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue:\nDuring 2015, total revenue increased $0.4 million to $90.5 million from $90.1 million in 2014. This increase was due primarily to a $4.3 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our subscriber base. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $3.9 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from lower selling prices of our Duplex phones and SPOT units ahead of the transition to second-generation products. Additionally, during 2015 movement of foreign exchange rates significantly burdened total revenue. Due to our global footprint, we generate a significant portion of our sales in foreign currencies. Total revenue would have been approximately $4.6 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service (dollars in thousands):\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>33,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>9,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Service Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue from equipment sales (dollars in thousands).\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nRevenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplex\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPOT\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Simplex\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IGO\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equipment Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth our average number of subscribers and ARPU by type of revenue.

We deactivated approximately 26,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 62,433 and ARPU would have been $36.03. \nFor 2015 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. For 2014 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 18,773 and 61,670, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.\nThe numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.\nOther service revenue includes revenue generated from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present average subscribers or ARPU for other service revenue in the table above.\nService Revenue\nDuplex service revenue increased $0.4 million in 2015. The Duplex subscriber base increased 14% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in service revenue generated from subscriber growth was offset partially by a decrease in ARPU (adjusted for the mass deactivations in 2014 as described above). Changes in the rate plans selected by our subscribers and the negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused this 2015 decrease in ARPU. In 2015 the movement of foreign exchange rates decreased Duplex service revenue by $2.3 million.\nSPOT service revenue increased 15% in 2015. SPOT ARPU increased 5% driven primarily by the significant number of SPOT Gen3TM sales over the past 12 months. We sell SPOT Gen3TM with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products. SPOT subscribers increased 11% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Expansion in international markets and a corresponding increase in activations are the principal reasons for growth in our SPOT subscriber base.\nSimplex service revenue increased 8% in 2015 due to a 14% increase in average Simplex subscribers during 2015, offset partially by a 5% decrease in ARPU due to the various competitive pricing plans we offer to our Simplex customers.\nOther revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 23%, in 2015. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to lower revenue generated from government contracts as well as a decrease in third party revenue. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned these subscribers to our network.\nEquipment Revenue\nRevenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2015. Although there was a 14% increase in the Duplex subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, Duplex equipment sales revenue declined due to a reduction in the selling price of our phones beginning in early 2015 in advance of the introduction of second-generation products, which we expect in 2016. Reduced Duplex equipment pricing has contributed to the 48% increase in the number of phones sold during 2015.\nRevenue from SPOT equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The rebates reduced equipment revenue, but contributed to the increase in SPOT service revenue by increasing our subscriber count. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.\nRevenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015. This decrease is due to product mix as we sold a larger number of high margin units in 2014 and a larger number of low margin units in 2015.\nTotal equipment revenue would have been approximately $1.2 million higher during 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from 2014.\nOperating Expenses:\nTotal operating expenses decreased $28.9 million, or 16%, to $157.1 million in 2015 from $186.0 million in 2014, due primarily to the reduction in the value of inventory recognized in 2014, which did not recur during 2015, and lower depreciation expense.\nCost of Services\nCost of services increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $30.6 million in 2015 from $29.7 million in 2014. The Thales in-orbit support contract signed in the fourth quarter of 2014 contributed $0.7 million to this increase. Research and development costs related to new products were also higher in 2015. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. We also recognized a decrease in third party costs. As mentioned above in other service revenue, while we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers. We record these costs in other cost of services as third party costs. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned most of these subscribers to our network; therefore, the costs have decreased.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales\nCost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $3.0 million, or 20%, to $11.8 million in 2015 from $14.9 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales is due to changes in the carrying value, mix, and volume of products sold during the respective years. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the carrying value of Duplex inventory based on evaluating and estimating timing of new product launches.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment Sales - Reduction in the Value of Inventory\nWe recognized no reduction in the value of inventory during 2015 compared to $21.7 million for 2014. The 2014 reduction consisted of the following:\n \u2022 During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $14.4 million. We recognized these charges after evaluating our Duplex inventory and estimating the timing of new product launches. Our assessment indicated that there was an excess of Duplex equipment included in inventory on hand based on our current sales run-rate. \n \u2022 During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $7.3 million following cancellation of our contract with Qualcomm related to finished goods and raw materials previously accounted for as advances for inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. We cancelled this contract in March 2013, and we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm in July 2014 whereby we paid $0.1 million to Qualcomm for all remaining finished goods and raw materials held at Qualcomm. Our future business plan contemplates using Hughes-based technology in future product development. As a result, much of the raw material held by Qualcomm is not likely to be used in the future production of additional inventory and their value was impaired. \nMarketing, general and administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million, or 12%, to $37.4 million in 2015 from $33.5 million in 2014. Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulting from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion, and aggressive rebate promotions comprised 50% of the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses for 2015. We also incurred higher bad debt expense, which constituted 28% of the increase for 2015 due primarily to specific reserves we recorded for certain commercial customer balances. Higher personnel costs, which were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs, also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. Stock compensation expense also decreased $0.4 million primarily related to the vesting of a key employee performance grant during 2014, which did not recur in 2015.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense decreased $8.9 million, or 10%, to $77.2 million in 2015 compared to $86.1 million in 2014. This decrease relates primarily to our ending depreciation of our first-generation satellites launched during 2007, which reached the end of their estimated depreciable lives during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense):\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 compared to $39.8 million in 2014.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt during 2015 included:\n \u2022 Holders of $6.5 million principal amount of 2013 8.00% Notes converted their notes"}
