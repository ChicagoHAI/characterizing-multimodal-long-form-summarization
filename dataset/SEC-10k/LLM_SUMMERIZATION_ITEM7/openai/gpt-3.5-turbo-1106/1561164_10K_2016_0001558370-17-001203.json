MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis covers the financial condition and results of operations of QTS Realty Trust, Inc. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the QTS Realty Trust, Inc.'s and QualityTech, LP's consolidated financial statements and related notes and Risk Factors\u201d contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our business and growth strategies, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d This Form 10-K contains stand-alone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of QTS and the Operating Partnership. We believe it is important to show both QTS and the Operating Partnership's financial statements and for investors to understand the few differences between them in the context of how QTS and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. See Explanatory Note\u201d for an explanation of these few differences.\nSince the financial data presented in this Item 7 does not contain any differences between QTS and the Operating Partnership, all periods presented reflect the operating results of the Operating Partnership.\nOverview\nWe are a leading owner, developer and operator of state-of-the-art, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant data centers. Our data centers are facilities that house the network and computer equipment of multiple customers and provide access to a range of communications carriers. We have a fully integrated platform through which we own and operate our data centers and provide a broad range of IT infrastructure solutions. We refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our 3Cs,\u201d which consists of Custom Data Center, Colocation and Cloud and Managed Services. We believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multi-tenant data centers in the United States, as measured by gross square footage, and have the capacity to nearly double our leased raised floor without constructing or acquiring any new buildings.\nWe operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia. Within the U.S., we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets plus other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations. This is in part reflected by our operating track record of five-nines\u201d (99.999%) reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than 1,100 customers, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.\nQTS is a Maryland corporation formed on May 17, 2013 and is the sole general partner and majority owner of QualityTech, LP, our operating partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. QTS' Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol QTS.\u201d As of December 31, 2016, QTS owned an approximate 87.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.\nThe Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS' historical predecessor prior to the IPO, having operated the Company's business until the IPO.\nWe believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.\nOur Customer Base\nWe provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers. Our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.\nOur Custom Data Center, or C1, customers typically are large enterprises with significant IT expertise and specific IT requirements, including financial institutions, Big Four\u201d accounting firms and the world's largest global Internet companies. Our Colocation, or C2, customers consist of a wide range of organizations, including major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies. Our C3 Cloud customers include both large organizations and SMBs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their IT infrastructure on a flexible basis. Examples of current C3 Cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various U.S. government agencies.\nAs a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2016, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d) (as defined below), with only one greater than 4% which accounted for approximately 13% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products.\nOur Portfolio\nWe develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 91.9% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million basis-of-design\u201d raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time. As of December 31, 2016, this space included approximately 1,346,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.2 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 151,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.2 million NRSF in our development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2016 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment.\nKey Operating Metrics\nThe following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics. These metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies.\nMonthly Recurring Revenue ( MRR\u201d). We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. MRR does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.\nAnnualized Rent. We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12.\nRental Churn. We define rental churn as the MRR lost in the period from a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period.\nLeasable Raised Floor. We define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration. The amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of C1, C2 and C3 product space.\nPercentage (%) Occupied and Billing Raised Floor. We define percentage occupied and billing raised floor as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which billing has commenced as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date, expressed as a percentage.\nBooked-not-Billed. We define booked-not-billed as our customer leases that have been signed, but for which lease payments have not yet commenced.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases, and ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018. For additional information with respect to the impact of the standards on our financial condition and results of operations, refer to Item 8 - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nRevenue. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor, lease currently available space, lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities, attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately 88% of our leasable raised floor. Our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental, cloud and managed services rates at our properties. Future economic downturns, regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry, new technological developments, evolving industry demands and other similar factors described above under Risk Factors\u201d could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, or at all, and could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet their obligations to us. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows. We also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop and/or re-lease that space at higher rates, which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is re-leased.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, 35% of our MRR came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to 6,600 square feet of space (or approximately 1 MW of power). As of December 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our MRR was attributable to the metered power model. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs, including actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. Fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model. These leases generally have a minimum term of five years. As of December 31, 2016, 65% of our MRR was leased to customers which individually occupied less than 6,600 square feet of space. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to the gross lease model. Under a gross lease, the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis, and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs, including utilities, maintenance, repair, property taxes and insurance, as reimbursement for these costs is factored into MRR. However, if customers incur more utility costs than their leases permit, we are able to charge these customers for overages. For leases under the gross lease model, fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew, lease and re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Leases which have commenced billing representing approximately 18% and 29% of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 (including all month-to-month leases) and 2018, respectively. These leases also represented approximately 36% and 26%, respectively, of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2016. At expiration, as a general matter, based on current market conditions, we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the then-current market rents.\nAcquisitions, Redevelopment and Financing. Our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates. We generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations, credit facilities, other unsecured and secured\nborrowings or the issuance of additional equity. We believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our redevelopment projects.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs, utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them. Although substantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain reimbursements for certain operating expenses, we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to senior management, our in-house sales and marketing organization, cloud and managed services support personnel and legal, human resources, accounting and other expenses related to professional services. We also will incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded company, including employee equity-based compensation. Increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nGeneral Leasing Activity\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we entered into customer leases representing approximately $4.0 million of incremental MRR, net of downgrades (and representing approximately $48.0 million of annualized rent) at $609 per square foot. In addition, $13.8 million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of $48.7 million at an average rent per square foot of $623, which was 0.6% higher than the annualized rent prior to renewal. We define renewals as leases where the customer retains the same amount of space before and after renewal, which facilitates rate comparability. Customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above. The rental churn rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 5.6%.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we commenced customer leases representing approximately $10.8 million of incremental MRR (and representing approximately $129.0 million of annualized rent) at $601 per square foot.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2016) was approximately $3.6 million, or $43.1 million of annualized rent. This booked-not-billed balanced is expected to contribute an incremental $20.0 million to revenue in 2017 (representing $29.5 million in annualized revenues), an incremental $2.9 million in 2018 (representing $4.6 million in annualized revenues), and an incremental $8.9 million in annualized revenues thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nChanges in revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table> <tr>

Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $402.4 million compared to $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $91.3 million, or 29%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, which contributed $32.7 million to the increase. In addition, the acquisition of the Piscataway facility contributed $12.6 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The balance aggregating $46.0 million related to organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Atlanta-Suwanee data centers.\nThe increase of $81.7 million, or 29%, in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the current period including a full year of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately a half year in 2015, which contributed $32.1 million to the increase, as well as the acquisition of the Piscataway facility in 2016 which contributed $7.1 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additional increases, aggregating $42.5 million, are attributable to newly leased space primarily from ongoing expansions in our Atlanta-Metro, Irving and Richmond data centers and increases in rents from previously leased space, net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our data centers were approximately 88% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 1,084,000 square feet, with approximately 956,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $390 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $323 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. As of December 31, 2016, the average annualized rent for our C1 product, including managed services for our C1 product, was $195 per leased raised\nfloor square foot, and the average annualized rent for our C2 product, including Cloud and managed services combined was $1,246 per leased raised floor square foot. As of December 31, 2015, our data centers were approximately 91% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 839,000 square feet, with approximately 761,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $433 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $337 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. The increase in leasable raised floor between 2015 and 2016 is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee and Chicago facilities, as well as the acquisition of Piscataway. The decrease in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot, both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue, is primarily due to an increase in mix of C1 customers in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to C1 revenue (40% of MRR) compared to December 31, 2015 (34% of MRR). Due to the fact that C1 customers reimburse us for utilities and various other operating expenses and that reimbursement is excluded from the calculation of annualized rent per square foot, this increase in the portion of customer rent which is related to C1 customers has contributed to the weighted average per square foot reduction.\nHigher recoveries from customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the Piscataway facility which contributed $5.2 million to the increase. The remaining increase of $1.5 million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our Irving data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase and increased utility costs generally related to an increase in utility usage at our Atlanta-Metro data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase, offset by reduced reimbursements of $0.6 million at our Princeton facility due to lower operating costs we incurred from efficiencies gained as well as a $0.1 million decrease at various other facilities. The $2.9 million increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher straight line rent.\nProperty Operating Costs. Property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $136.5 million compared to property operating costs of $104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $32.1 million, or 31%. The breakdown of our property operating costs is summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProperty operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,118 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,309 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,809 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,705 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,793 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepairs and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,081 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,695 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,386 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,753 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,097 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,656 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fee allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,643 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,458 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,188 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,157 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,031 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal property operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n136,488 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,355 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,133 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Piscataway facility contributed $23.2 million to the total increase in property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $1.3 million related to direct payroll, $4.7 million related to rent expense, $3.7 million related to repairs and maintenance, $3.8 million related to utilities, $3.7 million related to management fee allocation and $6.0 million related to other property operating costs, of which $4.1 million were associated with connectivity expenses. Management fee allocation for leased facilities acquired in 2015 is based on 10% of cash revenues for each facility and reflects an allocation of internal charges to cover back-office and service-related costs associated with the day-to-day operations of these data center facilities, with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses. The remaining $8.9 million increase in total property operating costs was primarily attributable to expansion of our existing facilities, which included increased direct payroll allocation of $2.5 million throughout our facilities, $0.6 million of increased repairs and maintenance expense which tends to fluctuate from period to period and will increase with the expansion and lease-up of our facilities, increased utility expense of $1.8 million primarily related to the expansion of our Irving data center, and other expenses of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million increase in other expenses was primarily attributable to increased software license costs, increased connectivity expenses and reduced capitalization of temporary and security personnel costs. In addition, management fee allocation increased $1.7 million (exclusive of the increase attributable to leased facilities acquired in 2015 and Piscataway as discussed above). Management fee allocation for the other QTS facilities is based on 4% of cash rental revenues for each facility.\nReal Estate Taxes and Insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $8.8 million compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $3.0 million, or 51%, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our Piscataway data center as well as increases in real estate taxes at our Irving data center and leased facilities acquired in 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $124.8 million compared to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $39.0 million, or 45%, was primarily due to depreciation expense of $9.7 million and amortization expense of $7.2 million associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, and depreciation expense of $1.2 million and amortization expense of $3.7 million associated with the Piscataway acquisition. The remaining increase of $17.2 million was due to additional depreciation of $14.7 million, primarily due to additional depreciation of the Irving, Richmond and Atlanta-Metro data centers, as well as higher amortization expense of $2.5 million primarily related to a higher level of leasing commissions. Included in depreciation and amortization above is an increase in the amount of non-real estate depreciation and amortization expense, which increased to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $4.8 million, or 41%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, contributing a greater level of cloud and managed services customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $83.3 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2016 compared to general and administrative expenses of $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $15.5 million, or 23%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and, to a lesser extent, the ongoing growth of the Company. Inclusive of expenses associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses related to sales and marketing personnel of $1.8 million, higher equity-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, higher payroll costs, net of sales and marketing personnel, of $6.7 million, higher software license costs of $1.5 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense of $0.7 million, higher rent expense of $0.7 million, higher temporary personnel and consulting fees of $0.7 million, increased travel expenses of $0.6 million and a $0.1 million increase in other expenses, offset by receipt of litigation settlement proceeds of $0.9 million. Total general and administrative expenses were approximately 20.7% and 21.8% of 2016 and 2015 revenues, respectively.\nTransaction and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $10.9 million in transaction and integration costs compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the current period, $9.6 million in costs were attributable to integration expenses primarily related to systems integration, duplicate personnel and accelerated depreciation of certain software relating to the leased facilities acquired in 2015, inclusive of an offset of approximately $1.0 million related to the reimbursement of certain escrow funds. The remaining $1.3 million primarily related to transaction costs incurred in the acquisition of the Piscataway and Fort Worth facilities. In the prior period, $4.9 million of expenses were incurred primarily related to the examination and acquisition of our leased facilities acquired in 2015, and $6.3 million related to integration costs related to the leased facilities acquired in 2015. Acquisition-related costs for acquisitions accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $23.2 million compared to $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $1.9 million, or 9%, was due primarily to an increase in the average debt balance of $138.5 million, primarily as a result of our ongoing developments, expansions and acquisitions, partially offset by issuance of additional common shares generating proceeds which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings and higher capitalized interest during the current period due to the growth in construction projects. The average debt balance, exclusive of debt issuance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $870.9 million, with a weighted average interest rate, including the effect of amortization of deferred financing costs, of 3.97%. This compared to an average debt balance of $732.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with a weighted average interest rate, including the effect of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred financing costs, of 4.24%. Interest capitalized in connection with our redevelopment activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $11.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.2 million compared to other expense of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other expense of $0.3 million was due to higher write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs in 2015 primarily related to the restructuring of our unsecured credit facility in October 2015, and, at the same time, the repayment of our $70 million secured credit facility relating to our Richmond data center.\nTax Benefit of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. Tax benefit of taxable REIT subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $10.0 million compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The current period tax benefit primarily related to recorded operating losses resulting from both current period operating losses and prior period tax provision adjustments. The prior period tax benefit primarily related to recorded operating losses, including transaction and integration costs, as well as the reversal of valuation allowances which were related to deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets were generally created by net operating losses of the taxable REIT subsidiary, and previously had valuation allowances applied to them in their entirety as there were continuing losses for that entity. With the acquisition of Carpathia, deferred tax liabilities were created, which in turn caused the Company to release the previously recorded valuation allowances during the second quarter of 2015. To the extent that the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries continue to generate operating losses, a tax benefit will generally continue to be recognized due to the existing net deferred tax liability.\nNet Income. A summary of the components of the increase in net income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows (in millions):\nTable 238:

Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $311.1 million compared to $217.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $93.3 million, or 43%, was primarily due to the acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Princeton facility acquired in 2014, which, combined, contributed $57.6 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our Irving, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee and Atlanta-Metro data centers, which contributed $35.7 million to this increase.\nThe increase of $86.6 million, or 44%, in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Princeton facility, which contributed $54.5 million in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as newly leased space and increases in rents from previously leased space, net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn, which contributed $32.1 million to the increase.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our data centers were approximately 91% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 839,000 square feet, with approximately 761,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $433 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $337 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. As of December 31, 2015, the average annualized rent for our C1 product, including managed services for our C1 product, was $192 per leased raised floor square foot, and the average annualized rent for our C2 product, including Cloud and managed services combined was $1,256 per leased raised floor square foot. As of December 31, 2014, our data centers were 85% leased based on leasable raised floor of approximately 698,000 square feet, with approximately 594,000 square feet occupied and paying\nrent, with an average annualized rent of $346 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $308 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. The increase in leasable raised floor between 2014 and 2015 is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the Richmond, Atlanta-Metro, and Irving facilities, as well as the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015. The increase in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot, both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue, is primarily due to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015. The increase in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed service revenue from $346 to $433 is primarily due to the increase in C3 product mix associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to C3 revenue (22% of MRR) compared to December 31, 2014 (11% of MRR). Due to the fact that C3 customers utilize less space than C1/C2 customers in proportion to MRR received, our weighted average rent per square feet price has increased.\nHigher recoveries from customers for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the Princeton facility which contributed $2.8 million to the increase. The remaining increase of $0.6 million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to increased utility costs generally related to an increase in usage from customers operating under our metered power model at our Richmond data center contributing $0.6 million to the increase as well as the opening of our Irving data center contributing $0.5 million to the increase. These increases were partially offset by $0.5 million of decreased utility costs generally related to a reduction in usage from customers operating under our metered power model at our Sacramento data center. The $3.3 million increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher straight line rent.\nProperty Operating Costs. Property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $104.4 million compared to property operating costs of $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $32.8 million, or 46%. The breakdown of our property operating costs is summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProperty operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDirect payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,309 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,470 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,896 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,016 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n164% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepairs and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,695 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,630 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,065 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUtilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,097 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,996 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,101 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fee allocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,185 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,646 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,157 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,511 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,646 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal property operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,355 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71,518 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Princeton facility contributed $24.7 million to the total increase in property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $3.3 million related to direct payroll, $8.0 million related to rent expense, $2.0 million related to repairs and maintenance, $2.4 million related to utilities, $5.2 million related to management fee allocation and $3.8 million related to other property operating costs. Management fee allocation for leased facilities acquired in 2015 is based on 10% of cash revenues for each facility and reflects an allocation of internal charges to cover back-office and service-related costs associated with the day-to-day operations of our data center facilities, with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses. The remaining $8.1 million increase in total property operating costs was primarily attributable to the revenue growth and expansion of our existing facilities, which included increased direct payroll allocation of $2.2 million throughout our facilities, $2.0 million of increased repairs and maintenance expense which tends to fluctuate from period to period and will increase with the expansion and lease-up of our facilities, and a $0.7 million increase in utilities expense primarily related to increased utilities usage in our Richmond and Atlanta-Metro facilities as well as the opening of our Irving data center, offset by reduced utilities usage at our Sacramento data center, reduced utility rates at our Atlanta-Metro and Atlanta-Suwanee facilities as well as a credit received from Georgia Power related to a retroactive adjustment in billing rates for the current year. In addition, management fee allocation increased $1.3 million (exclusive of the increase attributable to leased facilities acquired in 2015 and Princeton as discussed above). Management fee allocation for QTS facilities is based on 4% of cash rental revenues for each facility. The remaining $1.9 million increase in other property operating costs was primarily due to higher software license costs as well as higher outside services expenses from consulting fees and outsourcing of our facility security personnel, which resulted in lower direct payroll costs.\nReal Estate Taxes and Insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.9 million compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $0.8 million, or 15%, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our Princeton data center as well as an increase in property taxes at our Irving data center.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $85.8 million compared to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $27.5 million, or 47%, was primarily due to depreciation expense of $8.9 million and amortization expense of $6.1 million associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, and depreciation expense of $0.4 million and amortization expense of $1.1 million associated with the Princeton acquisition. The remaining increase of $11.0 million was due to additional depreciation of $10.4 million, primarily due to additional depreciation of the Irving data center, as well as expansion of the Richmond, Atlanta-Metro and Atlanta-Suwanee data centers, and higher amortization expense of $0.6 million primarily related to a higher level of leasing commissions. Included in depreciation and amortization above is an increase in the amount of non-real estate depreciation and amortization expense, which increased to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $5.1 million, or 79%, was primarily due to the acquisition of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 which contributed a greater level of cloud and managed services customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $67.8 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2015 compared to general and administrative expenses of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $22.5 million, or 50%, of which the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015 contributed $9.5 million. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to increased advertising expenses of $1.2 million, increased payroll expenses related to sales and marketing personnel of $1.2 million, higher equity-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, higher net payroll costs of $4.0 million, higher temporary personnel and consulting fees of $2.1 million, and other costs of $1.7 million. Other costs were primarily related to increased software license costs, increased travel and entertainment expenses and increased professional fees primarily related to legal expenses, offset by lower repairs and maintenance expense primarily related to computer and software. Total general and administrative expenses were approximately 21.8% and 20.8% of 2015 and 2014 revenues, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $1.3 million in restructuring costs related to severance for various remote employees. No such costs were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTransaction and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we incurred transaction costs of $4.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in costs related to the examination of actual and potential acquisitions. We also recognized $6.3 million in integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015. Acquisition-related costs for acquisitions accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $21.3 million compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $6.0 million, or 39%, was due primarily to an increase in the average debt balance of $216.8 million, primarily as a result of our ongoing developments and expansions and the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015. In addition, we recognized a full year of interest costs associated with our $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issuance in July 2014, and we had a higher revolving credit facility balance in the current year along with the assumption of approximately $43.8 million in capital leases as a result of the Carpathia acquisition on June 16, 2015, partially offset by higher capitalized interest during the period due to the growth in construction projects. The average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $732.4 million, with a weighted average interest rate, including the effect of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred financing costs, of 4.24%. This compared to an average debt balance of $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, with a weighted average interest rate, including the effect of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred financing costs, of 4.23%. Interest capitalized in connection with our redevelopment activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $9.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.5 million compared to other expense of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in other expense of $0.4 million was due to higher\nwrite-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs in 2014 primarily related to the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Unsecured Credit Facility, including $75 million outstanding under the term loan, in connection with the issuance of our Senior Notes in July 2014.\nTax Benefit of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. Tax benefit of taxable REIT subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to recorded operating losses, including transaction and integration costs, as well as the reversal of valuation allowances which were related to the deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets were generally created by net operating losses of the taxable REIT subsidiary, and previously had valuation allowances applied to them in their entirety as there were continuing losses for that entity. With the acquisition of Carpathia, deferred tax liabilities were created, which in turn caused the Company to release the previously recorded valuation allowances of approximately $3.4 million during the second quarter of 2015. To the extent that the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries continue to generate operating losses, a tax benefit will continue to be recognized due to the existing net deferred tax liability of $18.8 million at December 31, 2015. No such tax benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Income. A summary of the components of the increase in net income of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows (in millions):\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in revenues, net of property operating costs, real estate taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease in restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in transaction and integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in interest expense net of interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.0) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease in other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider the following non-GAAP financial measures to be useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our performance: (1) FFO; (2) Operating FFO; (3) Adjusted Operating FFO; (4) MRR; (5) NOI; (6) EBITDA; and (7) Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of our operating performance. FFO, Operating FFO, Adjusted Operating FFO, MRR, NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to FFO, Operating FFO, Adjusted Operating FFO, MRR, NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us.\nFFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO\nWe consider funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) to be a supplemental measure of our performance which should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income (loss) and cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating performance. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from sales of property, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nDue to the volatility and nature of certain significant charges and gains recorded in our operating results that management believes are not reflective of our core operating performance, management computes an adjusted measure of FFO, which we refer to as Operating funds from operations ( Operating FFO\u201d). We generally calculate Operating FFO as FFO excluding certain non-routine charges and gains and losses that management believes are not indicative of the results of our operating real estate portfolio. We believe that Operating FFO provides investors with another financial\nmeasure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and, to the extent they calculate Operating FFO on a comparable basis, between REITs.\nAdjusted Operating Funds From Operations ( Adjusted Operating FFO\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure that is used as a supplemental operating measure and to provide additional information to users of the financial statements. We calculate Adjusted Operating FFO by adding or subtracting from Operating FFO items such as: maintenance capital investment, paid leasing commissions, amortization of deferred financing costs and bond discount, non-real estate depreciation, straight line rent adjustments, deferred taxes and non-cash compensation.\nWe offer these measures because we recognize that FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO exclude real estate depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, the utility of FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO as measures of our operating performance is limited. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, our calculations of FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO are not necessarily comparable to FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us. FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a measure of our results of operations or liquidity or as a substitute for, or an alternative to, net income (loss), cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nA reconciliation of net income to FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO is presented below:\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted.\nSeparately, we calculate recognized MRR as the recurring revenue recognized during a given period, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues.\nManagement uses MRR and recognized MRR as supplemental performance measures because they provide useful measures of increases in contractual revenue from our customer leases. MRR and recognized MRR should not be viewed by investors as alternatives to actual monthly revenue, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

We allocate a management fee charge of 4% of cash revenues for all facilities, with the exception of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 which are allocated a charge of 10% of cash revenues, as a property operating cost and a corresponding reduction to general and administrative expense to cover the day-to-day administrative costs to operate our data centers. The management fee charge is reflected as a reduction to net operating income.\nManagement uses NOI as a supplemental performance measure because it provides a useful measure of the operating results from our customer leases. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors in evaluating and comparing the\noperating performance of our properties and to compute the fair value of our properties. Our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs' NOI as other REITs may not calculate NOI in the same manner. NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity or as an indication of funds available to meet our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties and not of our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI is presented below:\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Management believes that EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base charges (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results.\nIn addition to EBITDA, we calculate an adjusted measure of EBITDA, which we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA excluding write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, transaction and integration costs, equity-based compensation expense, restructuring costs and gain (loss) on sale of real estate. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.\nManagement uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures as they provide useful measures of assessing our operating results.

We may also pursue additional redevelopment of our Atlanta-Metro, Irving, Richmond, Chicago, Piscataway and Fort Worth data centers and future redevelopment of other space in our portfolio. The redevelopment of this space, including timing, is at our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including availability of capital and our estimate of the demand for data center space in the applicable market. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with net cash provided by operations, incurrence of additional long-term indebtedness, borrowings under our credit facility and issuance of additional equity or debt securities, subject to prevailing market conditions, as discussed below.\nIn March 2016, QTS filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Effective upon filing, the shelf provides for the potential sale of an unspecified amount of our Class A common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares representing preferred stock, warrants and rights to purchase our common stock or any combination thereof, subject to the ability of QTS to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing conditions. The shelf registration statement is intended to allow us to have the flexibility to raise such funds in one or more offerings should we perceive market conditions to be favorable. Pursuant to this shelf registration, on April 1, 2016, we issued 6,325,000 shares of QTS' Class A common stock at a price of $45.50 per share in an underwritten public offering, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares. We used substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately $276 million to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nCash\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $9.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following tables present quarterly cash dividends and distributions paid to QTS' common stockholders and the Operating Partnership's unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAggregate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Common Share and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend/Distribution\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Unit Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeptember 20, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 5, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJune 17, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJuly 6, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMarch 18, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 5, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.36 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 17, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 6, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.32 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.40 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table></table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAggregate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Common Share and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDividend/Distribution\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecord Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPer Unit Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeptember 18, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 6, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.32 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJune 19, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJuly 8, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.32 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMarch 20, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 7, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.32 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 19, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 7, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.29 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.25 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54.7 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2017 we paid our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per common share and per unit in the Operating Partnership to stockholders and unit holders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $965.8 million of indebtedness, including capital lease obligations.\nUnsecured Credit Facility. In May 2013, we entered into a $575 million unsecured credit facility comprised of a five-year $225 million term loan and a four-year $350 million revolving credit facility with a one year extension, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, and had the ability to expand the total credit facility by an additional $100 million subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement. In July 2014 our term loan was reduced by $75 million to $150 million in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes. On December 17, 2014, we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $650 million unsecured credit facility comprised of a five-year $100 million term loan maturing December 17, 2019 and a four-year $550 million revolving credit facility maturing December 17, 2018, with the option to extend one year until December 17, 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The lenders under the unsecured credit facility could issue up to $30 million in letters of credit subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nIn October 2015, we amended and restated our unsecured credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $250 million and extending the term. At the same time, we terminated our secured credit facility relating to the Richmond data center. The amended unsecured credit facility had a total capacity of $900 million and included a $150 million term loan which was expected to mature on December 17, 2020, another $150 million term loan which was expected to mature on April 27, 2021, and a $600 million revolving credit facility which was expected to mature on December 17, 2019, with a one year extension option. The amended unsecured credit facility also included a $200 million accordion feature. Under the amended unsecured credit facility, the capacity could be increased from $900 million to $1.1 billion subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement, including the consent of the administrative agent and obtaining necessary commitments.\nIn December 2016, we further amended and restated our unsecured credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $300 million and extending the term. The amended unsecured credit facility has a total capacity of $1.2 billion and includes a $300 million term loan which matures on December 17, 2021, another $200 million term loan which matures on April 27, 2022, and a $700 million revolving credit facility which matures on December 17, 2020, with a one year extension option. Amounts outstanding under the amended unsecured credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a spread that will vary depending upon our leverage ratio. For revolving credit loans, the spread ranges from 1.55% to 2.15% for LIBOR loans and 0.55% to 1.15% for base rate loans. For term loans, the spread ranges from 1.50% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.10% for base rate loans.\nUnder the amended unsecured credit facility, the capacity may be increased from the current capacity of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement, including the consent of the administrative agent and obtaining necessary commitments. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under our amended unsecured credit facility was 2.22%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders assessed on the unused portion of the unsecured revolving credit facility. At our election, we can prepay amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium.\nOur ability to borrow under the amended unsecured credit facility is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations, investments, distributions, asset sales and affiliate transactions, as well as the following financial covenants: (i) the Operating\nPartnership's and its subsidiaries' consolidated total unsecured debt plus any capitalized lease obligations with respect to the unencumbered asset pool properties may not exceed 60% of the unencumbered asset pool value (or 65% of the unencumbered asset pool value for up to two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent; provided the two fiscal quarter period includes the quarter in which the material acquisition was consummated); (ii) the unencumbered asset pool debt yield cannot be less than 14% (or 12.5% for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent; provided the two fiscal quarter period includes the quarter in which the material acquisition was consummated); (iii) QTS must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA, subject to certain adjustments, to consolidated fixed charges) for the prior two most recently-ended calendar quarters of 1.70 to 1.00; (iv) QTS must maintain a maximum debt to gross asset value (as defined in the amended and restated agreement) ratio of 60% (or 65% for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent; provided the two fiscal quarter period includes the quarter in which the material acquisition was consummated); (v) QTS must maintain tangible net worth (as defined in the amended and restated agreement) cannot be less than the sum of $1,179,931,500 plus 75% of the net proceeds from any future equity offerings; and (vi) a maximum distribution payout ratio of the greater of (i) 95% of the our Funds from Operations (as defined in the amended and restated agreement) and (ii) the amount required for the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Code.\nThe availability under the revolving credit facility is the lesser of (i) $700 million, (ii) 60% of the unencumbered asset pool capitalized value (or 65% of the unencumbered asset pool capitalized value for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent; provided the two fiscal quarter period includes the quarter in which the material acquisition was consummated) and (iii) the amount resulting in an unencumbered asset pool debt yield of 14% (or 12.5% for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent; provided the two fiscal quarter period includes the quarter in which the material acquisition was consummated). In the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence, the amount available under the revolving credit facility is adjusted to take into account any other unsecured debt and certain capitalized leases. A material acquisition is an acquisition of properties or assets with a gross purchase price equal to or in excess of 15% of the Operating Partnership's gross asset value (as defined in the amended and restated agreement) as of the end of the most recently ended quarter for which financial statements are publicly available. The availability of funds under our unsecured credit facility depends on compliance with our covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding $639.0 million of indebtedness under the amended unsecured credit facility, consisting of $139.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $500.0 million outstanding under the term loans, exclusive of net debt issuance costs of $4.1 million. In connection with the unsecured credit facility, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had an additional $1.5 million letter of credit outstanding. In addition, we entered into two additional letters of credit in June 2016 related to our Chicago facility and Piscataway facility in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\n5.875% Senior Notes due 2022. On July 23, 2014, the Operating Partnership and QTS Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the offering of the Senior Notes described below (collectively, the Issuers\u201d), issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022. The Senior Notes have an interest rate of 5.875% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.211% of their face value. The proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility, including $75 million outstanding under the term loan. As of December 31, 2016, the discount recorded on the Senior Notes was $1.8 million and the outstanding net debt issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes were $6.1 million.\nThe Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Operating Partnership's existing subsidiaries (other than foreign subsidiaries, receivables entities and 2470 Satellite Boulevard, LLC, which is a Delaware limited liability company formed in December 2015 that acquired an office building in Duluth, Georgia and has de minimis operations) and future subsidiaries that guarantee any indebtedness of QTS, the Issuers or any other subsidiary guarantor. QTS Realty Trust, Inc. does not guarantee the Senior Notes and will not be required to guarantee the Senior Notes except under certain circumstances. The offering was conducted pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture,\ndated as of July 23, 2014, among QTS, the Operating Partnership, QTS Finance Corporation, the guarantors named therein, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the Indenture\u201d).\nOn March 23, 2015, the SEC declared effective the Operating Partnership and QTS Finance Corporation's registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the Issuers exchanged the originally issued Senior Notes for $300 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Exchange Notes\u201d) that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The exchange offer was completed on April 23, 2015, and all outstanding originally issued Senior Notes were tendered. The Exchange Notes did not provide the Company with any additional proceeds and satisfied its obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes.\nThe Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Operating Partnership's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries ( Restricted Subsidiaries\u201d) to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends; make certain investments or other restricted payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements limiting the ability of the Operating Partnership's restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends; engage in sales of assets; and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of their assets. However, certain of these covenants will be suspended if and for so long as the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by specified debt rating services and there is no default under the Indenture. The Operating Partnership and its Restricted Subsidiaries also are required to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the Indenture) of at least 150% of their unsecured debt on a consolidated basis.\nThe Senior Notes may be redeemed by the Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time prior to August 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to (i) 100% of principal amount, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, and (iii) a make-whole premium. Thereafter, the Issuers may redeem the Senior Notes prior to maturity at 104.406% of the principal amount at August 1, 2017 and declining ratably to par at August 1, 2020 and thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. At any time prior to August 1, 2017, the Issuers may, subject to certain conditions, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at 105.875% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings consummated by us or the Operating Partnership. Also, upon the occurrence of a change of control of us or the Operating Partnership, holders of the Senior Notes may require the Issuers to repurchase all or a portion of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to various routine legal proceedings and other matters in the ordinary course of business. While resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based upon information currently available, that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, including the future non-cancellable minimum rental payments required under operating leases and the maturities and scheduled principal repayments of indebtedness and other agreements (in thousands):\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,344 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,004 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,108 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,708 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,919 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73,467 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n131,550 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital Leases and Lease Financing Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,944 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,370 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,844 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,190 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,388 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,972 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,708 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuture Principal Payments of Indebtedness (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n139,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n300,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n939,000 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,288 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,374 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,952 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n150,898 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n312,307 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n582,439 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,109,258 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDoes not include discount on Senior Notes reflected at December 31, 2016 or letters of credit of $1.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.1 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016 under our unsecured credit facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal obligations does not include contractual interest that we are required to pay on our long-term debt obligations.

The increased cash flow provided by operating activities of $44.5 million was primarily due to an increase in cash operating income of $41.0 million as well as an increase in cash flow associated with net changes in working capital of $3.5 million primarily relating to changes in rents and other receivables, deferred income, advance rents and other assets.\nCash flow used for investing activities decreased by $159.1 million to $453.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $612.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to less net cash paid for acquisitions which was $119.6 million greater in 2015 due to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and lower cash paid for capital expenditures primarily related to higher redevelopment in 2015 of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Chicago data centers of $40.2 million. These expenditures include capitalized soft costs such as interest, payroll and other costs to redevelop the properties, which were, in the aggregate, $22.4 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $300.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $500.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower net proceeds of $169.2 million under our unsecured credit facility, lower net proceeds from equity offerings of $93.7 million due to equity offerings completed in March and June 2015 compared to only one equity offering in April 2016, as well as an increase in payments of cash dividends to common stockholders of $16.7 million which was due to the increase in shares outstanding related to the April 2016 equity issuance and a higher dividend rate. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in mortgage principal debt repayments of $86.6 million due to paying off the Atlanta-Metro equipment loan and Richmond Credit Facility in full during 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash flow provided by operating activities was $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased cash flow provided by operating activities of $35.5 million was primarily due to an increase in cash operating income of $30.2 million as well as an increase in cash flow associated with net changes in working capital of $5.3 million primarily relating to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred income, other assets and prepaid expenses.\nCash flow used for investing activities increased by $319.9 million to $612.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $292.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher net cash outflow for acquisitions which was $201.6 million greater in 2015 and higher cash paid for capital expenditures primarily related to redevelopment of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Chicago data centers of $118.9 million.\nThese expenditures include capitalized soft costs such as interest, payroll and other costs to redevelop properties, which were, in the aggregate, $20.6 million and $17.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $500.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $224.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds from equity offerings completed in March and June 2015 totaling $369.4 million, higher net proceeds of $6.0 million under our unsecured credit facility and Senior Notes (which were issued in 2014) and reduced payments on deferred financing costs of $6.2 million. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in mortgage principal debt repayments of $84.4 million due to paying off the Atlanta-Metro equipment loan and Richmond Credit Facility in full during 2015, an increase in payments of cash dividends to common stockholders of $13.7 million which was due to the increase in shares outstanding related to the March 2015 and June 2015 equity issuances and a higher dividend rate, and an increase in principal payments on capital lease obligations of $6.9 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our predecessor's historical financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We describe below accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of December 31, 2016.\nReal Estate Assets. Real estate assets are reported at cost. All capital improvements for the income-producing properties that extend their useful life are capitalized to individual property improvements and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years from the date the property was placed in service. Property improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective improvement ranging from 20 to 40 years from the date the components were placed in service. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of 20 years or through the end of the respective life of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred.\nCapitalization of Costs. We capitalize certain redevelopment costs, including internal costs, incurred in connection with redevelopment. The capitalization of costs during the construction period (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) begins when redevelopment efforts commence and ends when the asset is ready for its intended use.\nIntangible Assets and Liabilities. Intangible assets and liabilities include acquired above-market leases, below-market leases, in-place leases, customer relationships, trade names and platform. Acquired above-market leases are amortized on a straight-line basis as a decrease to rental revenue over the remaining term of the underlying leases. Acquired below-market leases are amortized on a straight-line basis as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining term of the underlying leases, including fixed option renewal periods, if any. Acquired in-place lease costs are amortized as real estate amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the underlying leases. Acquired customer relationships are amortized as real estate amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the customer relationship. Should a customer terminate its lease, the unamortized portions of the acquired above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place lease costs and acquired customer relationships associated with that customer are written off to amortization expense or rental revenue, as indicated above. Acquired trade names are amortized as real estate amortization expense on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives. Acquired platform intangibles are amortized as non-real estate amortization expense on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of long-lived assets used in operations or in development and intangible assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the asset group. If the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the value of the\nundiscounted cash flows, the fair value of the asset is assessed and may be considered impaired. An impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired asset over its fair value.\nThe fair value of goodwill is the consideration transferred which is not allocable to identifiable intangible and tangible assets. Goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment. As a result of the Carpathia acquisition, the Company recognized approximately $174 million in goodwill. In connection with the goodwill impairment evaluation that the Company performed on October 1, 2016, the Company determined qualitatively that there were no indicators of impairment, thus it did not perform a quantitative analysis.\nDeferred Costs. Deferred costs, net on our balance sheet includes both financing costs and leasing costs. Deferred financing costs represent fees and other costs incurred in connection with obtaining debt and are amortized over the term of the loan and are included in interest expense. Deferred leasing costs consist of external fees and internal costs incurred in the successful negotiations of leases and are deferred and amortized to real estate amortization expense over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis. If an applicable lease terminates prior to the expiration of its initial term, the carrying amount of the costs are written off to amortization expense.\nDeferred Income. Deferred income generally results from non-refundable charges paid by the customer at lease inception to prepare their space for occupancy. We record this initial payment, commonly referred to as set-up fees, as a deferred income liability which amortizes into rental revenue over the term of the related lease on a straight-line basis.\nRental Revenue. We, as a lessor, have retained substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership and account for our leases as operating leases. For lease agreements that provide for scheduled rent increases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases, which commences when control of the space has been provided to the customer. Rental revenue also includes amortization of set-up fees which are amortized over the term of the respective lease, as discussed above.\nRecoveries from Customers. Certain customer leases contain provisions under which the customers reimburse us for a portion of the property's real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses, which include certain power and cooling-related charges. The reimbursements are included in revenue as recoveries from customers in the statements of operations and comprehensive income in the period in which the applicable expenditures are incurred. Certain customer leases are structured to provide a fixed monthly billing amount that includes an estimate of various operating expenses, with all revenue from such leases included in rental revenue.\nCloud and Managed Services Revenue. We may provide both our Cloud product and access to our Managed Services to our customers on an individual or combined basis. Service fee revenue is recognized as the revenue is earned, which generally coincides with the services being provided.\nInflation\nSubstantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain rent increases and reimbursement for certain operating costs. As a result, we believe that we are largely insulated from the effects of inflation over periods greater than three years. Leases with terms of three years or less will be replaced or renegotiated within three years and should adjust to reflect changed conditions, also mitigating the effects of inflation. Moreover, to the extent that there are material increases in utility costs, we generally reserve the right to renegotiate the rate. However, any increases in the costs of redevelopment of our properties will generally result in a higher cost of the property, which will result in increased cash requirements to redevelop our properties and increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods, and, in some circumstances, we may not be able to directly pass along the increase in these redevelopment costs to our customers in the form of higher rental rates.\nDistribution Policy\nTo satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT, and to avoid paying tax on our income, QTS intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions of all, or substantially all, of its REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders.\nAll distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our historical and projected results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, QTS' REIT qualification, our debt service requirements,\noperating expenses and capital expenditures, prohibitions and other restrictions under financing arrangements and applicable law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We anticipate that our estimated cash available for distribution will exceed the annual distribution requirements applicable to REITs and the amount necessary to avoid the payment of tax on undistributed income. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet these distribution requirements and we may need to borrow funds to make certain distributions. If we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been.\nThe Operating Partnership also includes certain partners that are subject to a taxable income allocation, however, not entitled to receive recurring distributions. The partnership agreement does stipulate however, to the extent that taxable income is allocated to these partners that the partnership will make a distribution to these partners equal to the lesser of the actual per unit distributions made to Class A partners or an estimated amount to cover federal, state and local taxes on the allocated taxable income. No distributions related to allocated taxable income were made to these partners for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and operations of QTS Realty Trust, Inc., a leading owner, developer, and operator of data centers.

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis covers the financial condition and results of operations of QTS Realty Trust, Inc. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the QTS Realty Trust, Inc.'s and QualityTech, LP's consolidated financial statements and related notes and Risk Factors\u201d contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our business and growth strategies, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d This Form 10-K contains stand-alone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of QTS and the Operating Partnership. We believe it is important to show both QTS and the Operating Partnership's financial statements and for investors to understand the few differences between them in the context of how QTS and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. See Explanatory Note\u201d for an explanation of these few differences.\nSince the financial data presented in this Item 7 does not contain any differences between QTS and the Operating Partnership, all periods presented reflect the operating results of the Operating Partnership.\nOverview\nWe are a leading owner, developer and operator of state-of-the-art, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant data centers. Our data centers are facilities that house the network and computer equipment of multiple customers and provide access to a range of communications carriers. We have a fully integrated platform through which we own and operate our data centers and provide a broad range of IT infrastructure solutions. We refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our 3Cs,\u201d which consists of Custom Data Center, Colocation and Cloud and Managed Services. We believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multi-tenant data centers in the United States, as measured by gross square footage, and have the capacity to nearly double our leased raised floor without constructing or acquiring any new buildings.\nWe operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia. Within the U.S., we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets plus other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations. This is in part reflected by our operating track record of five-nines\u201d (99.999%) reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than 1,100 customers, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.\nQTS is a Maryland corporation formed on May 17, 2013 and is the sole general partner and majority owner of QualityTech, LP, our operating partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. QTS' Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol QTS.\u201d As of December 31, 2016, QTS owned an approximate 87.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.\nThe Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS' historical predecessor prior to the IPO, having operated the Company's business until the IPO.\nWe believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.\nOur Customer Base\nWe provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers. Our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.\nOur Custom Data Center, or C1, customers typically are large enterprises with significant IT expertise and specific IT requirements, including financial institutions, Big Four\u201d accounting firms and the world's largest global Internet companies. Our Colocation, or C2, customers consist of a wide range of organizations, including major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies. Our C3 Cloud customers include both large organizations and SMBs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their IT infrastructure on a flexible basis. Examples of current C3 Cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various U.S. government agencies.\nAs a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2016, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d) (as defined below), with only one greater than 4% which accounted for approximately 13% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products.\nOur Portfolio\nWe develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 91.9% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million basis-of-design\u201d raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time. As of December 31, 2016, this space included approximately 1,346,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.2 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 151,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.2 million NRSF in our development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2016 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment.\nKey Operating Metrics\nThe following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics. These metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies.\nMonthly Recurring Revenue ( MRR\u201d). We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. MRR does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.\nAnnualized Rent. We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12.\nRental Churn. We define rental churn as the MRR lost in the period from a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period.\nLeasable Raised Floor. We define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration. The amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of C1, C2 and C3 product space.\nPercentage (%) Occupied and Billing Raised Floor. We define percentage occupied and billing raised floor as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which billing has commenced as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date, expressed as a percentage.\nBooked-not-Billed. We define booked-not-billed as our customer leases that have been signed, but for which lease payments have not yet commenced.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases, and ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018. For additional information with respect to the impact of the standards on our financial condition and results of operations, refer to Item 8 - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nRevenue. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor, lease currently available space, lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities, attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately 88% of our leasable raised floor. Our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental, cloud and managed services rates at our properties. Future economic downturns, regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry, new technological developments, evolving industry demands and other similar factors described above under Risk Factors\u201d could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, or at all, and could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet their obligations to us. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows. We also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop and/or re-lease that space at higher rates, which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is re-leased.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, 35% of our MRR came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to 6,600 square feet of space (or approximately 1 MW of power). As of December 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our MRR was attributable to the metered power model. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs, including actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. Fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model. These leases generally have a minimum term of five years. As of December 31, 2016, 65% of our MRR was leased to customers which individually occupied less than 6,600 square feet of space. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to the gross lease model. Under a gross lease, the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis, and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs, including utilities, maintenance, repair, property taxes and insurance, as reimbursement for these costs is factored into MRR. However, if customers incur more utility costs than their leases permit, we are able to charge these customers for overages. For leases under the gross lease model, fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew, lease and re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Leases which have commenced billing representing approximately 18% and 29% of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 (including all month-to-month leases) and 2018, respectively. These leases also represented approximately 36% and 26%, respectively, of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2016. At expiration, as a general matter, based on current market conditions, we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the then-current market rents.\nAcquisitions, Redevelopment and Financing. Our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates. We generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations, credit facilities, other unsecured and secured\nborrowings or the issuance of additional equity. We believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our redevelopment projects.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs, utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them. Although substantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain reimbursements for certain operating expenses, we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to senior management, our in-house sales and marketing organization, cloud and managed services support personnel and legal, human resources, accounting and other expenses related to professional services. We also will incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded company, including employee equity-based compensation. Increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nGeneral Leasing Activity\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we entered into customer leases representing approximately $4.0 million of incremental MRR, net of downgrades (and representing approximately $48.0 million of annualized rent) at $609 per square foot. In addition, $13.8 million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of $48.7 million at an average rent per square foot of $623, which was 0.6% higher than the annualized rent prior to renewal. We define renewals as leases where the customer retains the same amount of space before and after renewal, which facilitates rate comparability. Customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above. The rental churn rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 5.6%.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we commenced customer leases representing approximately $10.8 million of incremental MRR (and representing approximately $129.0 million of annualized rent) at $601 per square foot.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2016) was approximately $3.6 million, or $43.1 million of annualized rent. This booked-not-billed balanced is expected to contribute an incremental $20.0 million to revenue in 2017 (representing $29.5 million in annualized revenues), an incremental $2.9 million in 2018 (representing $4.6 million in annualized revenues), and an incremental $8.9 million in annualized revenues thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nChanges in revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized below (in thousands):\n\n*not applicable for comparison\nRevenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $402.4 million compared to $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $91.3 million, or 29%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, which contributed $32.7 million to the increase. In addition, the acquisition of the Piscataway facility contributed $12.6 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The balance aggregating $46.0 million related to organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Atlanta-Suwanee data centers.\nThe increase of $81.7 million, or 29%, in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the current period including a full year of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately a half year in 2015, which contributed $32.1 million to the increase, as well as the acquisition of the Piscataway facility in 2016 which contributed $7.1 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additional increases, aggregating $42.5 million, are attributable to newly leased space primarily from ongoing expansions in our Atlanta-Metro, Irving and Richmond data centers and increases in rents from previously leased space, net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our data centers were approximately 88% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 1,084,000 square feet, with approximately 956,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $390 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $323 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. As of December 31, 2016, the average annualized rent for our C1 product, including managed services for our C1 product, was $195 per leased raised\nfloor square foot, and the average annualized rent for our C2 product, including Cloud and managed services combined was $1,246 per leased raised floor square foot. As of December 31, 2015, our data centers were approximately 91% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 839,000 square feet, with approximately 761,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $433 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $337 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. The increase in leasable raised floor between 2015 and 2016 is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee and Chicago facilities, as well as the acquisition of Piscataway. The decrease in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot, both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue, is primarily due to an increase in mix of C1 customers in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to C1 revenue (40% of MRR) compared to December 31, 2015 (34% of MRR). Due to the fact that C1 customers reimburse us for utilities and various other operating expenses and that reimbursement is excluded from the calculation of annualized rent per square foot, this increase in the portion of customer rent which is related to C1 customers has contributed to the weighted average per square foot reduction.\nHigher recoveries from customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the Piscataway facility which contributed $5.2 million to the increase. The remaining increase of $1.5 million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our Irving data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase and increased utility costs generally related to an increase in utility usage at our Atlanta-Metro data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase, offset by reduced reimbursements of $0.6 million at our Princeton facility due to lower operating costs we incurred from efficiencies gained as well as a $0.1 million decrease at various other facilities. The $2.9 million increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher straight line rent.\nProperty Operating Costs. Property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $136.5 million compared to property operating costs of $104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $32.1 million, or 31%. The breakdown of our property operating costs is summarized in the table below (in thousands):\n\nThe acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Piscataway facility contributed $23.2 million to the total increase in property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $1.3 million related to direct payroll, $4.7 million related to rent expense, $3.7 million related to repairs and maintenance, $3.8 million related to utilities, $3.7 million related to management fee allocation and $6.0 million related to other property operating costs, of which $4.1 million were associated with connectivity expenses. Management fee allocation for leased facilities acquired in 2015 is based on 10% of cash revenues for each facility and reflects an allocation of internal charges to cover back-office and service-related costs associated with the day-to-day operations of these data center facilities, with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses. The remaining $8.9 million increase in total property operating costs was primarily attributable to expansion of our existing facilities, which included increased direct payroll allocation of $2.5 million throughout our facilities, $0.6 million of increased repairs and maintenance expense which tends to fluctuate from period to period and will increase with the expansion and lease-up of our facilities, increased utility expense of $1.8 million primarily related to the expansion of our Irving data center, and other expenses of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million increase in other expenses was primarily attributable to increased software license costs, increased connectivity expenses and reduced capitalization of temporary and security personnel costs. In addition, management fee allocation increased $1.7 million (exclusive of the increase attributable to leased facilities acquired in 2015 and Piscataway as discussed above). Management fee allocation for the other QTS facilities is based on 4% of cash rental revenues for each facility.\nReal Estate Taxes and Insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $8.8 million compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $3.0 million, or 51%, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our Piscataway data center as well as increases in real estate taxes at our Irving data center and leased facilities acquired in 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $124.8 million compared to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $39.0 million, or 45%, was primarily due to depreciation expense of $9.7 million and amortization expense of $7.2 million associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, and depreciation expense of $1.2 million and amortization expense of $3.7 million associated with the Piscataway acquisition. The remaining increase of $17.2 million was due to additional depreciation of $14.7 million, primarily due to additional depreciation of the Irving, Richmond and Atlanta-Metro data centers, as well as higher amortization expense of $2.5 million primarily related to a higher level of leasing commissions. Included in depreciation and amortization above is an increase in the amount of non-real estate depreciation and amortization expense, which increased to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $4.8 million, or 41%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, contributing a greater level of cloud and managed services customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $83.3 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2016 compared to general and administrative expenses of $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $15.5 million, or 23%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and, to a lesser extent, the ongoing growth of the Company. Inclusive of expenses associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses related to sales and marketing personnel of $1.8 million, higher equity-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, higher payroll costs, net of sales and marketing personnel, of $6.7 million, higher software license costs of $1.5 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense of $0.7 million, higher rent expense of $0.7 million, higher temporary personnel and consulting fees of $0.7 million, increased travel expenses of $0.6 million and a $0.1 million increase in other expenses, offset by receipt of litigation settlement proceeds of $0.9 million. Total general and administrative expenses were approximately 20.7% and 21.8% of 2016 and 2015 revenues, respectively.\nTransaction and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $10.9 million", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

As of December 31, 2016, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d) (as defined below), with only one greater than 4% which accounted for approximately 13% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products.\nOur Portfolio\nWe develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 91.9% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million basis-of-design\u201d raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time. As of December 31, 2016, this space included approximately 1,346,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.2 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 151,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.2 million NRSF in our development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2016 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts ( MW\u201d) of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment.\nKey Operating Metrics\nThe following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics. These metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies.\nMonthly Recurring Revenue ( MRR\u201d). We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. MRR does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.\nAnnualized Rent. We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12.\nRental Churn. We define rental churn as the MRR lost in the period from a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period.\nLeasable Raised Floor. We define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration. The amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of C1, C2 and C3 product space.\nPercentage (%) Occupied and Billing Raised Floor. We define percentage occupied and billing raised floor as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which billing has commenced as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date, expressed as a percentage.\nBooked-not-Billed. We define booked-not-billed as our customer leases that have been signed, but for which lease payments have not yet commenced.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases, and ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018. For additional information with respect to the impact of the standards on our financial condition and results of operations, refer to Item 8 - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report.\nRevenue. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor, lease currently available space, lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities, attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately 88% of our leasable raised floor. Our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental, cloud and managed services rates at our properties. Future economic downturns, regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry, new technological developments, evolving industry demands and other similar factors described above under Risk Factors\u201d could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, or at all, and could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet their obligations to us. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows. We also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop and/or re-lease that space at higher rates, which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is re-leased.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, 35% of our MRR came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to 6,600 square feet of space (or approximately 1 MW of power). As of December 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our MRR was attributable to the metered power model. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs, including actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. Fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model. These leases generally have a minimum term of five years. As of December 31, 2016, 65% of our MRR was leased to customers which individually occupied less than 6,600 square feet of space. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to the gross lease model. Under a gross lease, the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis, and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs, including utilities, maintenance, repair, property taxes and insurance, as reimbursement for these costs is factored into MRR. However, if customers incur more utility costs than their leases permit, we are able to charge these customers for overages. For leases under the gross lease model, fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew, lease and re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Leases which have commenced billing representing approximately 18% and 29% of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 (including all month-to-month leases) and 2018, respectively. These leases also represented approximately 36% and 26%, respectively, of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2016. At expiration, as a general matter, based on current market conditions, we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the then-current market rents.\nAcquisitions, Redevelopment and Financing. Our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates. We generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations, credit facilities, other unsecured and secured\nborrowings or the issuance of additional equity. We believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our redevelopment projects.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs, utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them. Although substantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain reimbursements for certain operating expenses, we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to senior management, our in-house sales and marketing organization, cloud and managed services support personnel and legal, human resources, accounting and other expenses related to professional services. We also will incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded company, including employee equity-based compensation. Increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.\nGeneral Leasing Activity\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we entered into customer leases representing approximately $4.0 million of incremental MRR, net of downgrades (and representing approximately $48.0 million of annualized rent) at $609 per square foot. In addition, $13.8 million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of $48.7 million at an average rent per square foot of $623, which was 0.6% higher than the annualized rent prior to renewal. We define renewals as leases where the customer retains the same amount of space before and after renewal, which facilitates rate comparability. Customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above. The rental churn rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 5.6%.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we commenced customer leases representing approximately $10.8 million of incremental MRR (and representing approximately $129.0 million of annualized rent) at $601 per square foot.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2016) was approximately $3.6 million, or $43.1 million of annualized rent. This booked-not-billed balanced is expected to contribute an incremental $20.0 million to revenue in 2017 (representing $29.5 million in annualized revenues), an incremental $2.9 million in 2018 (representing $4.6 million in annualized revenues), and an incremental $8.9 million in annualized revenues thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended

Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $402.4 million compared to $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $91.3 million, or 29%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, which contributed $32.7 million to the increase. In addition, the acquisition of the Piscataway facility contributed $12.6 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The balance aggregating $46.0 million related to organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Atlanta-Suwanee data centers.\nThe increase of $81.7 million, or 29%, in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the current period including a full year of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately a half year in 2015, which contributed $32.1 million to the increase, as well as the acquisition of the Piscataway facility in 2016 which contributed $7.1 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additional increases, aggregating $42.5 million, are attributable to newly leased space primarily from ongoing expansions in our Atlanta-Metro, Irving and Richmond data centers and increases in rents from previously leased space, net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our data centers were approximately 88% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 1,084,000 square feet, with approximately 956,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $390 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $323 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. As of December 31, 2016, the average annualized rent for our C1 product, including managed services for our C1 product, was $195 per leased raised\nfloor square foot, and the average annualized rent for our C2 product, including Cloud and managed services combined was $1,246 per leased raised floor square foot. As of December 31, 2015, our data centers were approximately 91% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 839,000 square feet, with approximately 761,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $433 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $337 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. The increase in leasable raised floor between 2015 and 2016 is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee and Chicago facilities, as well as the acquisition of Piscataway. The decrease in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot, both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue, is primarily due to an increase in mix of C1 customers in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to C1 revenue (40% of MRR) compared to December 31, 2015 (34% of MRR). Due to the fact that C1 customers reimburse us for utilities and various other operating expenses and that reimbursement is excluded from the calculation of annualized rent per square foot, this increase in the portion of customer rent which is related to C1 customers has contributed to the weighted average per square foot reduction.\nHigher recoveries from customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the Piscataway facility which contributed $5.2 million to the increase. The remaining increase of $1.5 million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our Irving data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase and increased utility costs generally related to an increase in utility usage at our Atlanta-Metro data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase, offset by reduced reimbursements of $0.6 million at our Princeton facility due to lower operating costs we incurred from efficiencies gained as well as a $0.1 million decrease at various other facilities. The $2.9 million increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher straight line rent.\nProperty Operating Costs.

Management fee allocation for leased facilities acquired in 2015 is based on 10% of cash revenues for each facility and reflects an allocation of internal charges to cover back-office and service-related costs associated with the day-to-day operations of these data center facilities, with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses. The remaining $8.9 million increase in total property operating costs was primarily attributable to expansion of our existing facilities, which included increased direct payroll allocation of $2.5 million throughout our facilities, $0.6 million of increased repairs and maintenance expense which tends to fluctuate from period to period and will increase with the expansion and lease-up of our facilities, increased utility expense of $1.8 million primarily related to the expansion of our Irving data center, and other expenses of $2.3 million. The $2.3 million increase in other expenses was primarily attributable to increased software license costs, increased connectivity expenses and reduced capitalization of temporary and security personnel costs. In addition, management fee allocation increased $1.7 million (exclusive of the increase attributable to leased facilities acquired in 2015 and Piscataway as discussed above). Management fee allocation for the other QTS facilities is based on 4% of cash rental revenues for each facility.\nReal Estate Taxes and Insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $8.8 million compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $3.0 million, or 51%, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our Piscataway data center as well as increases in real estate taxes at our Irving data center and leased facilities acquired in 2015.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $124.8 million compared to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $39.0 million, or 45%, was primarily due to depreciation expense of $9.7 million and amortization expense of $7.2 million associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, and depreciation expense of $1.2 million and amortization expense of $3.7 million associated with the Piscataway acquisition. The remaining increase of $17.2 million was due to additional depreciation of $14.7 million, primarily due to additional depreciation of the Irving, Richmond and Atlanta-Metro data centers, as well as higher amortization expense of $2.5 million primarily related to a higher level of leasing commissions. Included in depreciation and amortization above is an increase in the amount of non-real estate depreciation and amortization expense, which increased to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $4.8 million, or 41%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, contributing a greater level of cloud and managed services customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $83.3 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2016 compared to general and administrative expenses of $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $15.5 million, or 23%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and, to a lesser extent, the ongoing growth of the Company. Inclusive of expenses associated with the acquisition of leased facilities acquired in 2015, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses related to sales and marketing personnel of $1.8 million, higher equity-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, higher payroll costs, net of sales and marketing personnel, of $6.7 million, higher software license costs of $1.5 million, increased repairs and maintenance expense of $0.7 million, higher rent expense of $0.7 million, higher temporary personnel and consulting fees of $0.7 million, increased travel expenses of $0.6 million and a $0.1 million increase in other expenses, offset by receipt of litigation settlement proceeds of $0.9 million. Total general and administrative expenses were approximately 20.7% and 21.8% of 2016 and 2015 revenues, respectively.\nTransaction and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $10.9 million"}
